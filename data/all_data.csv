1,"the term child performer includes young singers, actors, dancers, gymnasts, etc. these children are exceptions to theconvention concerning minimum age for admission to employment, and so may be paid for their work, as long as they have permits that “limit the number of hours during which and prescribe the conditions in which employment or work is allowed”.",,,

1,"currently, child performers are protected by various laws, for example laws which dictate how many hours the child may work and how much education they must receive (both of which vary by country), or how much of their pay must be reserved for the child themselves (e.g., canada’s “coogan law”).",,,
1," yet some believe these laws do not provide adequate protection, and that these child performers represent a group (and a group which is on the increase) whose rights are being undermined.",,,

1," it is currently legal in most liberal countries, although iceland, for instance, is attempting to ban it in the near future (henscher).",,,
1," where it is not yet illegal, it is under serious scrutiny: its currently immense role in society (over 70% of young men are estimated to watch porn at least once a month (paul)) gives it great leverage in promoting, or reverting, social change.",,,

0," many forms of media are often accused of inciting violence , promoting stereotypes , or indoctrinating in some form or another .",,,
0," while this is contentious , the key principle that ` sex sells ' is more obvious .",,,
0," pornography is not like other media in that , while most other films are aimed at entertainment , this is aimed at arousal .",,,
0," that is , it is aimed at immediate and fully selfish pleasure , which is much more forceful and addictive than mere laughter .",,,
0, the psychological effect of pornography is harmful due to the associations it conditions its audience to make .,,,

1, instead the focus here is on those degrees that seek to train students to be practitioners of those disciplines rather than generalists with a focus on discussing them.,,,
1,there are two possible approaches to this debate (in fact there are many but two are the most obvious).,,,
1," the first – and the one most clearly in the spirit of the motion – is that the creative arts add little to the economy directly and that if society is going to have universities, especially in those countries where they are funded through direct taxation, then students should be focusing on subjects that have a proven economic worth.",,,
1," although the arts do contribute financially to an economy, it tends not to be in the way that, say, languages, engineering or economics do.",,,
1," there is another aspect here, which leads into the second interpretation, that graduates of creative arts departments rarely make their living in that field; the competition is simply too fierce.",,,
1,"that brings us on to prop’s second choice for a definition, which is that if people really want to learn the creative arts then a university setting is not the right place to do so.",,,
1," stage schools and fine art colleges are often separate from universities and, even then, some argue that if someone has real talent, they should just get on with it.",,,
1, there are countless examples of people who have excelled in the arts who have no formal training and learnt their craft ‘on the job’.,,,
1,the specific focus on the creative arts also poses some problems for proposition.,,,
1," if drama has to go, then why not philosophy – or for that matter large chunks of physics?",,,
1, very few graduates pursue their subject professionally and those who do tend to simply teach it to the next generation replicating the situation.,,,
1," as a result, if opposition accepts that, say, history has a place on the curriculum, because it is a useful way of training people’s minds, then why not train them as poets or ballerinas?",,,
1,"opposition has some strong arguments on this front – the arts directly generate more revenue than, say, english literature.",,,
1," many graduates go on to do jobs that don’t require any degree at all, let alone their particular degree – so, once again, why focus on this particular collection of degrees.",,,
1," opp’s strongest argument, however, is that society is about far more than cold economic data and that the arts add hugely to society in a way that is difficult to measure but would certainly be missed.",,,
1,this then opens up two lines of attack.,,,
1," the first is that the university experience is, in and of itself, a net social benefit.",,,
1," latterly, it also raises the issue that having members of a society with certain skills enriches it even if those graduates never use the skills they have acquired professionally in later life.",,,
1,debater’s note:this can be an interesting way of looking at what role higher education actually fulfills and what taxes are for in the relationship between economic benefit and the wider social health of a nation.,,,
1," a truly minimalist approach would only leave us with what are sometime called the old professions – medicine, law, engineering, teaching and academia.",,,
1, traditionally there would have been another slot on that list for the priesthood.,,,
1, that niche is probably now taken by it.,,,
1," however, it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate into an exchange about whether arts or science degrees are ‘harder’ by some objective standard.",,,
1," that’s really not the focus of this motion (and it’s rubbish as well) and, tempting though that particular intellectual cul-de-sac might be, it’s best avoided.",,,
1,for the purposes of these notes it is assumed that society is making some collective expenditure on the provision of degrees.,,,
1," although in some countries this may not be explicit as the students incur the costs of their degree either up front or at a subsequent date, there is still an opportunity cost in terms of work that person could have been doing if they were not engaged in their studies.",,,
0," in those countries where the full costs of a degree are borne upfront by the students’ parents, the proposition may like to point out that parents are rarely wild about the idea that their child wishes to study poetry or dance as they do not believe that the expenditure will ever be recouped in income.",,,
0,"the median earning figure across arts degrees is , itself deceptive .",,,
0," the median in the us is $ 45,000 but this disguises the lower end of the scale , with% earning $ 30,000 a year or less .",,,
0," unlike education and social work which at least tend to have the consistency of a government salary , the arts are also fantastically unreliable as an employment sector .",,,
0, teachers and social workers may have comparatively low salaries but at least they can be assured of job security .,,,
0," the arts offers low and unstable wages , frequently at an ongoing expense to the taxpayer , when the jobs exist at all .",,,
0," as a result , encouraging the creative arts through university qualifications places both an initial and , potentially , ongoing cost on the rest of society .",,,
0, it also means that graduates are likely to be destined to long term financial instability because of a decision they made as a teenager .,,,
0, it is difficult to see who benefits from such an arrangement .,,,
0, the idea that the best place to learn an artform is a classroom is fantastically modern .,,,
0, the idea of teaching them at all is fairly recent .,,,
0," if ever there were an example of ` those who can , do ; those who ca n't , teach ' , then it 's the arts .",,,
0," novelists , poets , painters , dancers , composers , musicians and others have been learning from each other as they practiced their art for , quite literally , millennia .",,,
0," universities have to provide a range of courses , some of which are going to be more financially viable than others , that fine .",,,
0," however , investment in one area inevitably means that there are resources not being focused elsewhere .",,,
0," it 's not a huge factor but some subjects -- creative arts , theology and a few others do represent a ` back door ' into universities for those who did n't get the grades to get onto more demanding courses .",,,
0," those students still need to sleep , study and socialize somewhere -- in place of those who could have taken their places on engineering , medicine , economics or similar courses had the space been available .",,,
0," by keeping these courses , universities are turning away students for other disciplines and those studying the arts courses are learning in a way that may not be the most productive -- as mentioned in the previous argument .",,,
0, it 's difficult to see who wins .,,,
1,"creative commons licenses are a kind of copyright license that gives people the right to use, share, and expand upon artists’ work.",,,
1, they offer users of content significant protection against accusations of copyright infringement and are even believed by advocates to offer artists greater flexibility and profit potential than traditional copyright.,,,
1, detractors on the other hand worry that they serve only to erode artists’ control of their work and their potential to earn income from it because of its dissemination into the public space.,,,
1," as it is a new field, the full legal ramifications and doctrines of creative commons licenses remain in contention.",,,
1,copyright is certainly not universal.,,,
1, for much of history ideas have been fair game to whoever could make use of them.,,,
1, the state would grant rights and monopolies on a case by case basis but this was as a reward or in return for benefit to the state not based upon inherent ideas of ownership.,,,
1, the invention of the printing press however meant that ideas could potentially travel much faster and made copying a work considerably easier so increasing demands for protection for the creator of a work.,,,
1, the first form of copyright statute was adopted in venice ingoverning printing licences and fromvenice also prohibiting publication of an author’s work without permission in an attempt to prevent abuses in the printing trade.,,,
1," it stated “it has been decreed that in future no printer in this city of ours shall dare to print or to sell printed copies of any work… if it is not made clear by original document… that the author of the work, or his immediate heirs, are content and desire that it should be printed and sold.”",,,
1,  copyright has also always been used by governments to control information.,,,
1,the first modern copyright law that gives rights to authors is generally considered to be the statute of anne from 1710.,,,
1, it was enacted because printing without consent was causing writers “very great detriment and [leading] too often to the ruin of them and their families” to prevent this the author “shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years” with the act was enforceable with fines.,,,
1, since this time copyright has become much broader and the length has often been increased.,,,
1, the system has gone worldwide but is now under threat from the internet and the ability to easily share things it brings.,,,
1,the role of the state is still key in copyright as it is the only possible enforcer.,,,
1, but the increasing unenforceability of copyright has led to calls to alter the dynamics of copyright in the context of art which could mean forcing artists to release their work under creative commons licenses.,,,
1,"this examines the various arguments for a new regime of artistic property rights, in which a new baseline would be creative commons licenses rather than more traditional, stricter copyright protections.",,,
0, an individual 's idea only truly belongs solely to them so long as it rests in their mind alone .,,,
0," when they disseminate their ideas to the world they put them in the public domain , and should become the purview of everyone to use .",,,
0," artists and creators more generally , should not expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea they happen to have , since no such ownership right exists in reality .",,,
0, no one can own an idea .,,,
0," thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products .",,,
0," physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .",,,
0, ideas do not share the same order of protection even now because they exist in a different order to physical reality .,,,
0," however , some intellectual property is useful in encouraging investment and invention , allowing people to engage their profit motives to the betterment of society as a whole .",,,
0," to an extent one can also sympathize with the notion that creators deserve to accrue some additional profit for the labour of the creative process , but this can be catered for through creative commons non-commercial licenses which reserve commercial rights .",,,
0, these protections should not extend to non-commercial use of the various forms of arts .,,,
0," this is because art is a social good of a unique order , with its purpose not purely functional , but creative .",,,
0," it only has value in being experienced , and thus releasing these works through creative commons licenses allows the process of artistic experience and sharing proceeds unhindered by outmoded notions of copyright .",,,
0," the right to reap some financial gain still remains for the artists , as their rights still hold over all commercial use of their work .",,,
0, this seems like a fair compromise of the artist 's right to profit from their work and society right to experience and grow from those works .,,,
0," current copyright law assigns too many rights , automatically , to the creator .",,,
0," law gives the generator of a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse , except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements .",,,
0, making creative commons licenses the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of people 's defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like .,,,
0, the creative commons guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors .,,,
0, at base the default setting of somehow having absolute control means creators of work often do not even consider the reuse by others in the commons .,,,
0," the result is creation and then stagnation , as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator .",,,
0," mandating that art in all its forms be released under a creative commons licensing scheme means greater access to more works , for the enrichment of all .",,,
0," this is particular true in the case of `` orphan works '' , works of unknown ownership .",,,
0," fears over copyright infringement has led these works , which by some estimates account for% of all books , have led to huge amounts of knowledge and creative output languishing beyond anyone 's reach .",,,
0," a mix of confusion over copyright ownership and unwillingness of owners to release their works , often because it would not be commercially viable to do so , means that only% of all works currently protected by copyright are commercially available .",,,
0, releasing these works under creative commons licenses will spawn a deluge of enriching knowledge and creative output spilling onto the market of ideas .,,,
0, it would mark a critical advancement in the democratization and globalization of knowledge akin to the invention of the printing press .,,,
0, the nature of the internet and mass media on the 21st century is such that many artists can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them .,,,
0, wider use by other artists and laymen alike helps artistic works `` go viral '' and to gain major impact that allow the artist to generate a name for his or herself and to attain the levels of earnings conventional copyrights are meant to help artists generate but that ultimately hamstring them .,,,
0," a major example of this is the band nine inch nails , which opted into begin releasing its albums through the creative commons .",,,
0," creative commons licenses are so remarkable because they can be deployed by artists to expand their markets , and to profit even more from their greater recognition .",,,
0," after all , the artists still retain control of the commercial uses of their work and are guaranteed under creative commons licensing regulations to be credited by users of their content .",,,
0, giving undue artistic and distribution control to the artists through constricting and outmoded copyright may mean less significant reach and impact of the work .,,,
0, the state should thus facilitate the sharing by mandating the distribution of art of all kinds under creative commons licenses .,,,
0," the state incurs huge costs in monitoring for copyright infringement , in arresting suspected perpetrators , in imprisonment of those found guilty , even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that , once released to it , belonged to the public domain more or less .",,,
0," furthermore , the deterrent effect to copyright piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .",,,
0," in fact , the level of internet piracy of books , music , and films has increased dramatically year on year for several years , increasing by% inalone .",,,
0," this is because in many cases copyright laws are next to unenforceable , as the music and movie industries have learned to their annoyance in recent years , for example ninety percent of dvds sold in china are bootlegs while even western consumers are increasingly bypassing copyright by using peer to peer networks .",,,
0," only a tiny fraction of perpetrators are ever caught , and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it has done little to stop their incidence .",,,
0," copyright , in many cases , does not work in practice plain and simple .",,,
0, releasing works under a creative commons licensing scheme does a great deal to cope with these pressures .,,,
0," in the first instance it is a less draconian regime , so individuals are more willing to buy into it as a legitimate claim by artists rather than an onerous stranglehold on work .",,,
0, this increases compliance with the relaxed law .,,,
0," secondly , the compliance means that artists are given the vocal crediting under the license rules that gives them more public exposure than clandestine copying could not .",,,
0, ultimately this adaptation of current copyright law would benefit the artist and the consumer mutually .,,,

1,the outing of gay celebrities is a difficult debate based around the balancing of societal benefit from the act with the rights of individuals to retain their right to privacy over their sexual orientation.,,,
1," many gay rights activists support the act with websites such as “queer attitude” and “famous and gay” publicizing openly gay people in the public sphere, and continue to push for further exposure.",,,
1," counter to this, groups such as the even the gay, lesbian and allies senate staff caucus in the united states remain fundamentally opposed to the outing of gay celebrities and politicians.",,,
1," this exists in a situation where we ask the question not if it’s good for people to out themselves, but if we have the right to out individuals who have chosen not to already.",,,
0, outing gay celebrities puts the fight for gay equality in the fore of political discussion by removing the capacity for opposition to pass it off as a `` minority '' problem that is not of utmost concern .,,,
0, by outing gay celebrities we do two things .,,,
0," first , we both get rid of the narrative that says that being gay is uncommon and `` weird '' , which has been one of the ways right-wing parties have been able to prejudice the public against the gay rights movements .",,,
0," second , due to the public nature and high exposure of these individuals , it pushes the issue directly into the political spotlight , removing the ability of politicians to deny its significance or avoid discussing it as a pressing issue for legislation .",,,
0," by doing these two things , we propel the issue of gay rights into the political domain and help to shatter the harmful narratives opposition parties have fabricated to quell the struggle for equal rights .",,,
0, celebrities are uniquely placed to help break down misunderstanding and prejudice against the gay community .,,,
0," one of the biggest obstacles to breaking down prejudice is the fact that people do not associate with the cause and can view it as alien and a problem that `` they '' have , not one that `` we '' can understand .",,,
0, celebrities are uniquely placed to help bridge this gap and foster sympathy and understand about the fight for gay rights because of the relationship they foster with people in society .,,,
0, people feel as though they have an emotional connection and familiarity with the people who are rocketed into their family rooms through their tv every night .,,,
0, this level of familiarity means that when they are outed as gay leads to a breakdown of the idea that gay rights are an issue for `` them '' as it 's an issue that now directly affects you .,,,
0," moreover , the emotional connection you feel you have with the characters these people play , means that you personalize their situation more than you would with any other form of gay rights activism .",,,

0," if gay celebrities do not out themselves to help the cause of an oppressed group in society , the society that has created them and their success has the right to do it for them .",,,
0, celebrities have limited rights to privacy when that privacy conflicts with the well-being of the individuals who create their success and celebrity status in the first place .,,,
0," therefore , the outing of gay celebrities is something that society is entitled to do as the lack of outing themselves breaks their obligation to the society that created them .",,,

1, one suggestion has been that the money that comes from oil wealth – which may come directly from a state owned oil company or taxes on the production from private companies as a result of the oil being a state resource (the usa is the only country where the resources underground is entirely private) – should be put in an independent fund.,,,
1, this is what norway does.,,,
1, this fund would be out of reach of politicians and only give back a certain amount per year – such as just the profit from the investments.,,,
0," the wealth from oil , or other natural resources , holds back democratization as a result of the `` resources curse '' or `` paradox of plenty '' .",,,
0," resources provide money , and money is what is needed to run a security state .",,,
0," when money can come from natural resources there is little need to tax the people , instead it becomes a `` rentier '' economy where the dictator has resources to buy support without recourse to taxation .",,,
0, it is essentially the opposite of the well-known idea ` no taxation without representation ' ; if the money comes not from taxes but from oil what need is there for democracy ?,,,
0, this proposal takes away the option of having access to large oil revenues instead providing only a limited amount to the state rather than the pockets of the dictator .,,,
0, this prevents the buying of key groups such as the army and the policy who can be used to repress the population .,,,
0, it is not by chance that the only countries in the arab middle east that could be considered democracies before the arab spring never had oil ; jordan and lebanon .,,,
0," environmental damage is an example of the ` tragedy of the commons ' where if a resource is not owned by an individual , or is free to all , then it will be overexploited .",,,
0, this is because it is in everyone 's self-interest to use it as much as possible .,,,
0, the result is pollution ; politicians and oil companies want to exploit the oil as cheaply as possible so they dump pollution on the local population .,,,
0," for example , the $billion ruling handed down last year by a court in lago agrio , a town near ecuador 's border with colombia , held chevron accountable for health and environmental damages resulting from chemical-laden wastewater dumped fromto .",,,
0, putting oil wealth into a trust fund can help prevent this kind of abuse .,,,
0, there are two reasons for this .,,,
0, first if politicians are not getting an immediate benefit they will be less inclined to overlook pollution and there wo n't be money to buy support for drilling and pollution to continue .,,,
0, the second is that since the fund is meant to provide long term benefits and investments one of the things it can be doing is being devoted to cleaning up any pollution that is created thus protecting the future generations .,,,
0, it is very tempting to recklessly use an unexpected windfall of money immediately .,,,
0," but the best thing to do is to invest for the long term either to build infrastructure that will pay back its cost in future economic growth , or to invest it in funds that will continue paying dividends long into the future .",,,
0, the example of how britain and norway spent their north sea oil revenues is very revealing : `` the british governments spent their north sea winnings on cutting national borrowing and keeping down taxes .,,,
0, whatever came in went straight into the day-to-day budget .,,,
0," by contrast , for the pastyears norway has squirreled away the government 's petroleum revenue in a national oil fund ''  which now has $billion in assets , almost twice the country 's gdp , providing% returns .",,,
0,  the advantage of such investment is that they will continue to bring income even after the oil is gone .,,,
0, the oil will therefore benefit future generations as well as the current one .,,,
0, a panel of experts which are immune to political influence is the most likely body to think about long-term needs of the country and devise a plan which can ultimately bring income for a long period of time .,,,
0," having oil does not just provide the money to undermine , or prevent democracy taking hold ; it also provides an immense source for corruption .",,,
0, oil revenues provide a revenue stream that is not dependent on the people but simply upon the global market and oil production .,,,
0," in a country with no checks and balances , accountability or transparency the money will inevitably go to the elite .",,,
0, this is how equatorial guinea can be rich while having most of the population in poverty .,,,
0, dictator obiang himself is worth an estimated $ 700million or the equivalent of about% of gdp .,,,
0,  a trust fund can ensure that money from oil goes to the poorest not the richest .,,,
0, it is managed outside the country and away from political pressure .,,,
0, if the government is corrupt and uses the national budget to its own ends the trust fund can provide the dividends as investment in individual development projects to ensure the money is used where it is most needed .,,,
0, all the time it can be transparent to show when and where the government is trying to influence it or get backhanders .,,,
1,"low unemployment is not only crucial for a functioning economy, but for a society.",,,
1," after thefinancial crisis and start of the eurozone crisis in 2009, and subsequent worldwide sluggish economy, unemployment has become more of a problem in the european union.",,,
1," concerns about debt and growth have discouraged investment, and in a number of states in the eu, such as portugal, ireland, greece and spain, caused states to require bailouts, often under the condition of the imposition of austerity measures.",,,
1, austerity measures have meant public sector job losses in the countries concerned and even many countries that have not had austerity enforced by the size of their debt have been engaging in cutting back the public sector.,,,
1," as a result, the seasonally adjusted employment rate in the eu as a whole (including both the countries who have been bailed out, and those bailing them out, such as germany and the netherlands) has increased from 7.5% in julyto 11% in july 2013.",,,
1,"unemployment is not evenly spread across demographic groups, however.",,,
1," according to eurostat, the group with the highest rate of unemployment is young people – 23.4% of under 25s were unemployed in 2013, compared to 7.6% in 2008.",,,
1, this does not include people in education so almost a quarter of young people who finish school or university are finding that they cannot find a job.,,,
1," youth unemployment not only causes problems to individuals, but broader social problems in the countries, in addition to the financial cost of social security, and the wasted potential.",,,
1," the only long term solution to this is an economic recovery however this is something that is unlikely to happen quickly, even once the economy begins to recover it will be years before many countries reach full employment.",,,
1," therefore, it has been proposed that a solution to youth unemployment is to guarantee young people a temporary job.",,,
1,"this job could last for six months, which could be enough time to gain the skills which are needed to find further work and for the young people to show they can do a job.",,,
1, government would fund this.,,,
1," furthermore, government would fund training or preparation necessary for a person to do this.",,,
1, however there would be limits to ensure it is not too expensive to train individuals.,,,
1, the only requirement for private companies would be to create as many roles as needed.,,,
0," the eu member states should rely more on public employment services , which should be focused on finding jobs for young people .",,,
0," with government funding , they can work with the private sector to offer decent temporary jobs to young people .",,,
0," this model is common in the nordic states and other countries , such as austria , germany and switzerland also have similar programs .",,,
0, youth unemployment is already far higher than for older people .,,,
0," less than a third of under 25s who were looking for a job infound one in-- this may be due to ageist discrimination against young people , and employers seeking people with experience .",,,
0, people overare also considered as a high risk group .,,,
0, they have little experience so the employer is taking a risk in employing them .,,,
0, there is also a desire for stability ; those who already have a family are unlikely to want large changes so employers feel they can bet on them for the long term .,,,
0, if the problem is a lack of experience then this proposal solves the problem .,,,
0," giving younger people a temporary job and the experience that goes with it will help give everyone an equal chance at getting a job , irrespective of age .",,,
0," therefore , the eu should step in and help provide jobs for younger people .",,,
0, rising youth unemployment can be considered an international timebomb .,,,
0, young people are the next generation of workers and consumers in the economy .,,,
0," when they are unemployed , the situation can be alarming .",,,
0, this is because of the importance of getting a job early on so as to avoid becoming long term unemployed .,,,
0," the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has called for stronger policies involving young people .",,,
0, the ilo has warned that youth unemployment can lead to apathy towards government and political instability .,,,
0, the lack of experience in work may cause a lost generation .,,,
0," this must be averted , and the eu is one of the best placed to do this .",,,
0, the temporary work scheme would encourage business to change their attitude and hire more young workers .,,,
0," having to hire young people , even for a short time , would help break negative stereotypes and often the employers would then offer longer term work .",,,
0, this would help to fill the 2million unfilled vacancies that exist in the eu with young people .,,,
0, while we often think of workplace diversity as being about having people from all over the world and both men and women a good age balance is necessary too .,,,
0," by bringing in this policy , younger workers will be in the same workplaces as older employees , and vice versa , making for more workplace diverse .",,,
0," employees will learn from those with more experience , in addition to the other advantages of a more diverse workforce .",,,
0, one of these is more engagement and engaged workers perform% better and are less likely to leave .,,,
0," another is that young people will contribute new and innovative ways of thinking , with different viewpoints pushing the business forward .",,,
0, finally a company needs to have all ages in the business to ensure that there are people with experience when older workers retire .,,,
0, diversity is also crucial for the appearance of a business .,,,
0, the kind of company that attracts a broader pool of individuals means a greater range of talented candidates to choose from .,,,
0, businesses who create more diverse workplaces perform better .,,,
0, if the government is employing people then it is going to be boosting the economy .,,,
0, providing a fiscal boost by spending money is one of the most accepted ways of boosting the economy .,,,
0, in this case spending money on temporary workers is good in several ways .,,,
0, first it is a fiscal boost to the economy .,,,
0, the government will be paying the temporary workers .,,,
0, these workers will have more money to spend and will probably mostly spend it rather than saving .,,,
0, this in turn boosts demand for other goods and services so meaning there needs to be more output with the result that some jobs will be made permanent .,,,
0, there is therefore a positive feedback loop .,,,
0, the second way in which this helps the economy is that it is investment .,,,
0, it is investment because the government is paying for young people to gain experience and for companies to be training these temporary workers .,,,
0, the result of this is a more skilled workforce who in the long term will be more productive .,,,
0, there is a final possible benefit .,,,
0, with government paying for workers they are effectively subsidizing firms .,,,
0, even if they are new trainees the young temporary workers will be providing output for companies at next to no cost .,,,
0, this then makes that firm more competitive against its global competitors .,,,
1,in the middle of the 1990s the formerly nationalised british rail was privatised.,,,

1, the intention is that this phase would be complete byand the second phase would finish construction a few years later inhaving been started slightly later.,,,
1, the price tag was set as being £32.7billion.,,,
1,"since its launch however things have not been going well for hs2, it has faced hostility from residents along the route, questions about whether it will deliver its touted benefits and whether it is the best route, judicial reviews and inflating costs.",,,
1, just as seriously for a long term infrastructure project the opposition labour party has been increasingly sceptical with the shadow chancellor ed balls at the labour party conference declaring “under this government the high speed two project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50bn… labour will not take this irresponsible approach… there will be no blank cheque from me as a labour chancellor for this project or for any project.”,,,
1, with labour almost certain to be in power at some point beforethe government clearly needs some backing from the opposition if the business community is to buy in.,,,
1,"the government has also been slowly revising down the forecasted benefits of the high speed line; in its most recent report the benefits were lowered from £2.50 to £2.30 for every pound spent on the project, and this comes only a few days after reports that there would be many places around the country that would actually lose out as a result of the new line.",,,
1," many people are not even convinced by the revised benefits and argue the money could be better spent elsewhere, either upgrading the existing network or even on areas that have nothing to do with railways.",,,

0, the west coast main line is a particular bottleneck for freight with% of uk freight services using the line ; any increase would have to come at the expense of passenger services .,,,
0, transferring the main rail services to the high speed line would free up the wcml to increased freight and commuter use so hs2 would not just mean an increase in long distance capacity .,,,

1, on 2nd marcheuropean leaders with the exception of the uk and czech republic signed the fiscal compact which committed its signatories to a structural deficit (meaning it allows for deficits for investments like infrastructure that will pay off in the future) not exceeding 0.5% of gdp and to reducing government debt down to 60% of gdp.,,,
1, austerity however is not popular and the results of the recent elections are threatening this treaty and its ambitious goals.,,,
1, this discusses whether europe needs to stick to stringent austerity measures such as those that will be needed to meet the compact or should states put the social support of their citizens first.,,,
1,some terms used in this debateausterity: during the recent crisis has come to mean an economic policy of cutting the deficit and debt through cutting spending.,,,
1, this often inevitably means reducing benefits.,,,

0," we all need a place to live , a level of healthcare and some income in order to survive .",,,
0, the idea behind the welfare state is to provide for this through creating a safety net for every citizen .,,,
0, the state is responsible for the social and economic wellbeing of it citizens .,,,
0," it does this by , for example , provision of social housing -- either at greatly reduced rates or free of charge , through state hospitals , through unemployment benefit for those made unemployed and disability benefits for those who ca n't work .",,,
0, with austerity the government is doing exactly the opposite of what it should be doing to help its citizens .,,,
0, just at a time when more people need these payments they are being cut back .,,,
0, to make matters worse an increase in vat has been a favored method of increasing government income while there has been a squeeze on unemployment benefits as the government does not want to pay more as unemployment rises ; in greece in the year to decemberthe number of unemployed workers was up 45.1 % whereas the number of unemployment benefit recipients went up only 9.6 % .,,,
0," as a result the whole package of austerity measures is usually regressive , with its impact falling harder on the poor than the rich , as has been the case in greece .",,,
0, austerity leads to a cycle of decline that continues on down until the state has been stripped down to the bare bones .,,,
0," we are seeing this in countries where the european union has enforced austerity as a condition for bailouts , particularly greece .",,,
0, government austerity reduces demand as the government is spending less .,,,
0, with less demand the economy is damaged and a smaller tax take comes in for the government leading to even greater austerity if the government is to balance its books .,,,
0, austerity therefore creates a vicious cycle when there is no extra demand from the private sector to cushion the blow .,,,
0," even standard & poor 's previously a champion of austerity in its justification for downgrading the credit rating of eurozone governments said `` austerity alone risks becoming self-defeating , as domestic demand falls in line with consumers ' rising concerns about job security and disposable incomes , eroding national tax revenues . ''",,,
0," the answer is therefore less austerity , more support for the economy and more social support for the citizens .",,,
0, if people are less concerned for the future as a result of knowing there will be government support if they are made unemployed they will be more willing to spend rather than save when they are employed so helping the economy to recover .,,,
0, recessions are caused by too little demand in the economy so austerity in a time of recession is exactly the opposite of what the government should be doing as it means further reductions in the amount of demand in the economy .,,,
0," governments should take an activist approach to try to stabilise the economic cycle , the swinging from boom to bust to boom that characterises the economy , or at least reduce the depths of the recessions and temper the booms .",,,
0," this means that governments should spend less when the economy is booming and , crucially , more when the economy is in recession so as to stabilise the economy .",,,
0," it should be remembered that government spending does not just affect the public sector there is a multiplier effect on the economy , spending on building a road not only means construction companies get business but so do their suppliers and their workers spend their new wages in shops .",,,
0, economists working for president obama at the time of the u.s. stimulus believed that for every$ spent by the government there would be 1.6 $ benefit to the economy .,,,
0, the current course of austerity on top of austerity risks creating a lost generation of youth across europe .,,,
0, unemployment is high everywhere in europe but it is particularly pronounced among young people .,,,
0," in the eurozone the average youth , under 25s , unemployment rate is 21.6 % while in spain and greece it is more than% .",,,
0, such staggeringly high unemployment rates will have immense consequences as a whole generation is demoralised .,,,
0, even when the economy recovers this lost generation may not be able to get a job as new school leavers and graduates will get the jobs in preference to those who have been unemployed for long periods .,,,
0," there needs to be more money , not less , for education and retraining for the sectors of the economy where there are jobs , such as it specialists .",,,
0," this means more investment not just in adult education but more money being spent on creating jobs , whether permanent , placements or internships , specifically to give young people experience in work .",,,

1," however, with increased mobility and a smaller need for manual labour, it is been put into doubt whether the cities can handle the vast amounts of people who enter on a daily basis.",,,
1, this is particularly problematic in developing nations where any city already has innate problems which might be exacerbated by the influx of more people.,,,
1," in major cities, such as nairobi and johannesburg, large townships have appeared, often as large in themselves as major european cities, where poor people lead a parallel existence, separated from the urban community.",,,

1, china’s hukou system is one of china’s major social controls with the aim of directly regulating population distribution.,,,
1," it links chinese citizens access to state benefits, and sometimes jobs, to the individual staying where they are registered.",,,
1," this does not prevent rural to urban migration, as it is possible to change status, but it does attempt to control migration.",,,
1,in this debate the government would make it illegal for people in the countryside to move into the cities without first receiving permission from the authorities.,,,
1, failing to recognise the ban would lead to deportation to the community from whence the individual came and possibly other sanctions.,,,
1," this could be done through border controls or more probably by linking each individual’s identity to their community, by means of passports or social identity numbers, to make it impossible to live a functional life in the city without permission.",,,

0," therefore people live in communities where decisions that affect the many , are taken by representatives of the many .",,,
0," thus , a social contract exists between the people and their government .",,,
0," in exchange for part of their autonomy and freedom , the government ensures that policies are made in the best interest of people , even if this might come at the expense of short-term interests for some individuals .",,,
0, this is a typical example of this kind of case .,,,
0," the trend is emptying the countryside , stopping the production of agricultural goods and hollowing the amenities provided by the cities .",,,
0," even if each individual has a personal incentive to move to the cities , the harm to the cities is greater than their accumulated individual gains .",,,
0, it is in these cases that the state must act to protect its people and ensure long term benefits .,,,
0, cities are very appealing to poor people .,,,
0," even if their living standards in cities might be unacceptable , they get closer to basic goods , such as fresh water , sanitation etc, however , these things exist because there are productive people in the cities who work and pay taxes .",,,
0, what happens when too many people come at the same time is that public money is stretched too thinly and these basic goods can no longer be provided .,,,
0," this leads to severe humanitarian problems such as malnutrition , thirst , lack of medication , etc, however , this humanitarian crisis does not only harm those directly affected , it also creates an unattractive environment for business .",,,
0," thus , people who enter the city can not find work , as production does not grow in relation to the people who enter .",,,
0," they become excluded from society and often turn to crime , which further erodes the economy .",,,
0, limiting migration to reasonable levels give the cities a chance to develop progressively and become the kind of places that people in rural areas currently believe them to be .,,,
0," unlimited rural-urban migration erodes the economy of the cities , as shown in the previous argument , and limits their economic growth and available resources .",,,
0," on a national level , this causes decision makers to prioritise the cities , as the country relies more on urban than rural areas , thus preventing them from investing in the country-side .",,,
0," china is a good example of this where urban privilege has become entrenched with ` special economic zones ' being created in urban areas , though sometimes built from scratch in rural areas , with money being poured into infrastructure for the urban areas which as a result have rapidly modernised leaving rural areas behind .",,,
0, this leads to a whole culture of divisions where urbanites consider those from rural areas to be backward and less civilized .,,,
0," moreover , there will be little other reason to invest in rural areas , as the workforce in those areas has left for the cities .",,,
0," by preserving resources in the cities and keeping the workforce in the rural areas , it becomes possible to invest in rural communities and change their lives for the better as these areas maintain the balanced workforce necessary to attract investors .",,,
0, the cause of rural-urban migration in developing nations and the main reason why it becomes problematic is that people who move to the cities are not making informed decisions .,,,
0," they are led to believe that the cities contain opportunities that they can not find where they live , and there are no mechanisms such as efficient media or adequate education to eradicate this misconception .",,,
0, myths can be easily propagated by a single successful migrant returning home to visit that then attracts many others to try their luck without any knowledge of the possible costs .,,,
0, this is exacerbated by unscrupulous organisations that prey on their desperation to take all their money to organise their move to the city .,,,
0," some of those who are trafficked find themselves brought to the city and exploited through forced labour , begging , or even prostitution .",,,

1, beyondmiles musk believes that supersonic jets would be more economic – though of course at the moment there is no supersonic air travel.,,,
1, the route for which the proposal is initially designed from san francisco to los angeles is onlymiles so the hyperloop would be the best possible mode of transport; it would be several times faster than any current commercial transportation method as well as being cheaper.,,,
1,there are several main elements to the proposal;first it is in a tube the whole distance.,,,
1, the reason for this is to reduce resistance.,,,
1, the tube would be at a much lower pressure than the outside world so there would be less density of air creating less resistance and so allowing faster speeds while using less energy.,,,
1," the tube itself would be on pylons and could be built above existing road infrastructure for much of the way, with the exception of when the corners on the roads are too tight.",,,
1,despite the low pressure there would still be a build up of air in front of the pod (the individual car in which the users are seated) essentially making it like a syringe with the pod pushing the air in front so once again building up resistance.,,,
1, the hyperloop however would use a compressor fan to transfer air at high pressure to the bottom and rear of the pod.,,,
1, this would allow the creation of an aircushion – musk suggests this is much the same as an air hockey table – underneath the pod so eliminating the need for wheels.,,,
1,the hyperloop would be powered by electricity.,,,
1," the pod would be initially accelerated by external round induction motors, as used by musk’s own tesla cars, at the stations that would bring the pods to high speeds of aroundmph.",,,
1, the limited resistance would mean there would be no motor operating most of the time but the pods would be given a reboost everymiles or so.,,,
1, the pods themselves would have batteries to power their fan and any internal electronics.,,,
1, as it is all electric musk suggests that by placing solar panels along the top of the tube the hyperloop would generate more than enough electricity to run itself so this would be a green method of travel.,,,
1,"the proposal for the hyperloop provides two separate options for the system; either a passengers only system in which each pod would takepassengers, or one in which the pod would also accommodatevehicles which increases the cost of the system.",,,
1,"the hyperloop would not be anything like any current transportation, musk seems to have described the proposal quite accurately in the months before the announcement as a “cross between a concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table”.",,,
1," it would be like concord in that it is an (almost) supersonic transportation system, a railgun in terms of how the propulsion is created and an air hockey table keeping the pods afloat.",,,
0, public transportation has not been getting much faster over the last few decades .,,,
0," the fastest method of transport , supersonic jets in the form of concorde ceased operation in october.",,,
0, even if at some point a new generation of supersonic planes are built these will not be ideal for travelling between cities that are comparatively close together .,,,
0, the time spent getting the plane up and down from cruising altitude means they would take longer over these short distances than a slower option at ground level .,,,
0, the hyperloop at more than 700mph will be twice as fast as high speed rail .,,,
0," to take the different options on the san francisco-los angeles route cars take 5hours 30minutes , the proposed high speed train would take 2hours 38minutes , by plane takes 1hour 15minutes whereas the hyperloop would only take 35minutes .",,,
0, the hyperloop would be cheap to build .,,,
0," the pods themselves would only cost $ 1.35 million each , the pressurised tube just $ 650million , or double if wanting vehicles , with only two stations their cost would only be $ 250million .",,,
0, the biggest cost would be the construction of the pylons carrying the tube which is estimated at $ 2.55 or $ 3.15 billion .,,,
0, there is an estimated total cost of $ 4.06 billion for the passenger only version or $ 5.31 billion for the vehicle version .,,,
0, this should be compared to the current cost for california 's high speed rail project which is estimated to be $ 68billion while covering much the same ground .,,,
0, the hyperloop would be the cheapest mode of intercity transport possible .,,,
0, `` transporting 7.4 million people each way and amortizing the cost of $billion overyears gives a ticket price of $for a one-way trip for the passenger version of hyperloop . '',,,
0, there are very few additional costs .,,,
0, usually the main cost for transportation beyond the infrastructure is the energy but the hyperloop produces more energy than it uses so would make a profit here .,,,
0, there would be additional maintenance costs and some minor staff costs but this is unlikely to add too much to the ticket price .,,,
0, the hyperloop would therefore be very price competitive compared to the $and up for flights .,,,
1,"a minimum wage is the minimum price at which firms may hire workers, and conversely at which individuals can sell their labor.",,,
1, the government usually sets the minimum wage level at a point that will increase the wages of the lowest earners.,,,
1, new zealand was the first country to set any kind of minimum wage law when it established arbitration boards in the industrial conciliation and arbitration act of 1894.,,,
1, there is now some kind of minimum wage or collective bargaining legislation over the minimum wage in more than 90% of countries.,,,
1, there are however large differences in terms of the level of the minimum and how it is set.,,,
1, the united kingdom for example has a national minimum wage set at £5.93 per hour for workers overyears old with lower rates for younger people.,,,
1, there is another group of countries that do not have national minimum wages but do have collectively agreed minimum wages.,,,
1," these are usually decided per sector, countries that use this form of collective bargaining to set minimum wages include german and italy.",,,
1, a few countries such as macedonia have no minimum wage at all.,,,
1," opponents of the minimum wage argue that everything should be left to the free market and use supply and demand theory to argue that unemployment will be the result of a minimum, as firms will be unwilling to pay the extra price for workers.",,,
1," proponents however instead focus on social justice and the exploitation of workers, particularly the most vulnerable.",,,
0, businesses operating in a free market are concerned principally with their bottom lines .,,,
0," in order to increase profits , firms will seek to exploit workers , to lower wages as far as possible .",,,
0," this exploitation will continue indefinitely , unless the state intervenes .",,,
0, the state does so by implementing a minimum wage .,,,
0," the lowest paid workers tend to be less educated , less skilled , and less organized than higher-paid employees .",,,
0, this makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace .,,,
0," in order to stop this outright exploitation of the most vulnerable members of society , the power of wage setting must fall to some extent within the purview of the state .",,,
0," certainly , it is far better for state , which has citizens ' best interest at heart , to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses , which tend not to care about their workers ' welfare or have competing interests .",,,
0," furthermore , a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation ; it affirms that all people have worth , can not be exploited , and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce , i.e. a minimum wage .",,,
0," this is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society , by encouraging them to value themselves .",,,
0," also , the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities .",,,
0, citizens of more equal societies tend to have more in common and can share more in the construction of societal goals and aims .,,,
0," this form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage , in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery .",,,
0," without a minimum wage , the lowest paid members of society are relegated to effective serfdom , and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit , accepting similarly low wages .",,,
0," there is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure , since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families .",,,
0, their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages .,,,
0, the minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices .,,,
0," without resources there can be no true choice , as all choices would be coerced by necessity .",,,
0," because people 's choices are intrinsically interconnected , and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply , when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else , he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask , leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another , each competing to prove he is worth the least .",,,
0, a minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition .,,,
0," what the minimum wage does to alleviate these problems is that it gives individuals the ability to pursue the good life , something that has become a global ideal .",,,
0," people want to be happy , and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment .",,,
0," fundamentally , the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited , giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies .",,,
0," employees work harder when they are paid more , but employers can often be more concerned with the short-term bottom line and will not treat workers in the lowest echelons of their firms with much consideration , viewing them instead as disposable and replaceable economic units .",,,
0," mandating a minimum wage can thus benefit firms , even if they do not recognize it , by making workers more productive and also fostering a general work ethic .",,,
0," as workers feel more valued in the economic system , the more likely they are to work loyally and diligently for their employers .",,,
0," furthermore , better pay means more disposable income in the hands of employees , which leads to greater demand by them for goods and services .",,,
0, this demand-induced economic growth is a very important part of economic growth .,,,
0," the more people are able to spend , the more money flows into the economy , leading to more business and higher employment .",,,
0," without the minimum wage , a downward spiral of spending can ensue , proving deleterious to firms and the economy generally .",,,
0," additionally , the minimum wage decreases expensive social welfare payments , since workers no longer need as many supplements to their wages from the state in order to make up for the shortfall created by too-low wages .",,,
0, when wages are extremely low the incentive to enter alternative markets is increased .,,,
0," this is particularly harmful in the case of illegal markets , such as those for drugs or prostitution .",,,
0," when there is little to be gained from obtaining a legitimate job , no matter how plentiful they might be in the absence of a minimum wage , they would be undesirable by comparison to potentially highly lucrative black market opportunities .",,,
0," the minimum wage is essential for keeping the opportunity cost of entering the black market sufficiently high that people opt always to enter the mainstream , legal market .",,,
0," furthermore , when the possibility of work in the legitimate market exists , even if work is harder to find due to a minimum wage , the very possibility of getting such a job will serve as a disincentive to pursuing illegal employment .",,,
1,sovereign wealth funds (swfs) are investment vehicles owned by governments that wish to invest some of their country’s reserves of money abroad.,,,
1," in the past they tended to be owned by countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil, such as norway and kuwait.",,,
1," these states were keen to invest some of their high resource revenues in the good times, as a hedge against low points in the commodities cycle and the time when their natural wealth becomes exhausted.",,,
1," investing such large sums of money at home was likely to lead to wasteful spending and inflation, as well as concentrating risk, so they sought opportunities abroad in bonds and share markets.",,,
1,"about two-thirds of the value of global swfs is associated with oil wealth, but other emerging economies have also established state-owned companies to invest some of their reserves overseas.",,,
1, as long ago assingapore’s government established temasek as a holding company for state-investments.,,,
1," this has been seen as an important contributor to national prosperity, both through the income it has generated from wise investments, and because of the way it has supported singapore’s emergence as a developed economy with thriving high-tech and financial sectors.",,,
1," more recently asian countries with current account surpluses have built up large government reserves of currency, and have set up sovereign wealth funds in order to generate higher returns on these holdings.",,,
1," it was estimated inthat swfs held $2500 billion in assets, with a projected increase to over £10000 billion by 2012.",,,
1,"swfs vary greatly in their investment strategies, with some like norway’s stabilisation fund or kuwait’s investment authority being content to act as passive investors holding small stakes in hundreds of companies as well as mutual funds, private equity groups and hedge funds.",,,
1," others, such as temasek or dubai international capital are more active, seeking to take substantial positions in foreign companies or even to buy them outright.",,,
1,"concern has been raised over the rapid growth in swf assets, and the impact they may have on international financial markets.",,,
1," more politically controversial in many countries is the motivation behind the more active swfs’ strategies – are they seeking simply to maximise returns for their state owners, or could their purchases be part of a more sinister plan to exploit financial stakes abroad for political reasons?",,,
1," attempts by state-owned companies from china and dubai to buy major american companies ran up against political opposition in 2006-7 and were abandoned, although inflows of money from swfs have been welcomed as part of efforts to shore up shaky banks.",,,
1,"as swfs have become more prominent, many proposals have been put forward to restrain their activities, including voluntary codes promoted by the imf and suggestions that they commit to becoming only passive investors.",,,
1," others, including former us treasury secretary larry summers, have argued for stronger action, such as rules restricting their voting rights or to limit their investment in a company to a maximum level of, say 20%.",,,
1," this topic focuses upon the arguments for and against sovereign wealth funds in general, but does include reference to some of the most popular models of regulation.",,,

0," they are now so big that their activities can shift markets , such as norway 's government pension fund did when short selling iceland 's banks , leading to panic and instability when they sell assets suddenly .",,,
0," their purchases can mean that companies owned by other states can end up dominating the economies of smaller countries , undermining their own sovereignty and economic independence .",,,
0, it is also worrying that many swfs are controlled by undemocratic states which have a questionable commitment to capitalism ; should we allow such states to exercise so much power over our economies ?,,,
0, sovereign wealth funds raise worrying issues about national security .,,,
0," unlike mutual funds or private equity groups , which seek only to maximise their investors ' returns , swfs must be regarded as political entities .",,,
0," rather than passively holding their assets , they may seek to use their purchases to gain access to natural resources , advanced technologies , including those crucial to our defence , or other strategic sectors .",,,
0, for example gulf states are using their swfs to invest in food and natural resources from latin america .,,,
0," they may engage in economic nationalism , shutting factories in western countries to give an unfair advantage to their own industries .",,,
0," while it has not yet happened they may even attempt economic blackmail , threatening to turn off the lights through their control of energy companies and utilities if governments do not fall in with their foreign policy aims .",,,
0," allowing countries such as china , russia and various gulf states to buy up western companies at will is potentially very dangerous .",,,
0," even if we regard these states as friendly at the moment , there is no guarantee that they will stay that way , especially as none of them share our political values .",,,
0, sovereign wealth funds suffer from an almost total lack of transparency .,,,
0," most countries maintain secrecy about the size of their funds and the extent of their holdings , their accountability to government , their investment strategies and their approach to risk management .",,,
0," without knowing these things , it is impossible to gauge whether political or economic objectives will dominate the swfs ' behaviour , or indeed whether they will make safe and responsible shareholders in any business -- secrecy breeds corruption .",,,
0," for these reasons , jeffrey garten of yale has argued that swfs should be obliged to publish independently audited accounts twice a year .",,,
0, he has also pointed out that many countries operating swfs protect their domestic economy from foreign competition and investment .,,,
0," we should demand reciprocity , so that countries seeking investments abroad must open up their own economies fully before they are allowed to hold significant assets elsewhere .",,,
0, the ownership of important businesses by sovereign wealth funds runs counter to the economic policy pursued by almost every government over the pastyears .,,,
0, in the 1970s many states owned nationalised industries as part of an attempt at socialist economic planning that has now been discredited .,,,
0," state ownership distorted incentives , interfered with management and produced decades of underinvestment , poor service to consumers , and national economic failure with the most extreme example being the soviet union itself .",,,
0," since the 1980s countries everywhere have followed the example of thatcher 's britain and privatised their industries , freeing them to compete efficiently and to generate more wealth and jobs than they had ever done in state hands .",,,
0," going back to state ownership of business is a dangerous backward step , especially as it is now foreign governments that are doing the nationalising .",,,
0, a number of possible models of regulation have been suggested for sovereign wealth funds .,,,
0," some , such as gilson and milhaupt , have argued that state-owned investment vehicles that buy shares abroad should not be allowed voting rights in that stock .",,,
0," others would put a cap on swf investments , so that they can not take a stake of more than , say% in any business without government approval within the country the swf is investing in -- meaning that they can only be passive investors .",,,
0, both these proposals would ensure that they are unable to abuse a dominant position while still allowing countries to benefit from cross-border investment in a globalised economy .,,,
0, at the same time such rules would prevent any broader protectionist backlash so the sovereign wealth funds themselves could welcome the regulation .,,,
1,developmental aid exists in a variety of forms such as the official developmental assistance (oda) awarded by donor nations in the un’s development assistance committee (dac).,,,
1,   these flows of official financing are given with the aim of “promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective…”.,,,
1," although there may be discussion over what parameters or index should be used to measure the overall development of a nation, the success of the awarded aid depends largely on the localised effects of the particular aid projects and any wider results that have been obtained.",,,
1," oda often has strings attached to the aid, but this usually is conditions such as equipment having to be bought from the country that is providing the aid.",,,
1," there may sometimes be other conditions such as a country being unwilling to give development assistance to countries that have particularly poor human rights records, though this will almost certainly not apply to any emergency aid.",,,
1, for example the uk suspended aid to rwanda at the end ofin response to reports showing rwanda was fueling the civil war in neighbouring congo.,,,
1,this however does not usually translate into action in other similar areas.,,,
1," in the contexts of scarce accountability and poor labour standards, development aid often carries on regardless.",,,
1," this is despite international labour standards, being particularly suited to ensure that economic development remains concentrated on improving human life and dignity by making sure that economic growth and development go along with the creation of decent work.",,,
1, in other words labour standards could be seen as a core part of any sustainable development that such aid is aiming to achieve.,,,
1," should raising labour standards therefore, to increase the efficacy of aid, be considered a pre-requisite for development aid.",,,
1," whether this is a fair, efficient and more importantly, achievable criterion to be met by developing nations is the keystone focus of this debate.",,,
0, labour and business standards are a cornerstone of agreement on universal human rights between various international actors and so it is right that they should be linked to aid .,,,
0, inthe ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work were adopted and are considered binding on all members regardless of whether they have ratified the conventions .,,,
0, the business and labour regulations protect the basic worker rights and improve job security through demanding the elimination of discrimination and empower workers through the recognition of `` freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining '' like in those in developed western countries .,,,
0, this then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up .,,,
0, it would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid .,,,
0, it should be remembered that there has been general acceptance of international labour standards not just for human rights reasons but also because having minimum standards is beneficial economically -- for example ahour working week is more productive per hour than ahour week .,,,
0, what are international labour and business standards ?,,,
0, they are globally acceptable methods of doing business and employing labour .,,,
0," these include conventions against forced labour , discrimination and child labour .",,,
0," these also form guideline structures for social policy such as labour dispute resolution bodies , employment services and good industrial relations .",,,
0," therefore , this goes hand in hand with reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living of the employees , and hence the standard is a facet of development in itself .",,,
0, this helps in achieving the goals of a stable long term plan for economic growth as well paid workers are necessary for consumer spending .,,,
0, employing higher standards would be a way to tackle the problems with distribution of aid at the grassroots and increase efficiency within the system organically .,,,
0, the poorest countries invariably have the lowest standards of labour and business .,,,
0," it is essential to raise these standards to an international level , implementing standards against practices like child labour .",,,
0," if this is done then the purpose of development aid , which is to increase the day to day standard of living of the people , will improve .",,,
0," in an absence of such a pre-requisite , a developing country will be free to employ standards that do not reflect the same principles of the donor nation .",,,
0," thus , to avoid a hypocritical scenario , this pre-requisite is necessary .",,,
0, increasing the required standard of business and labour will result in increases to the current standard labour and business standards even before aid is entirely tied as countries implement changes to ensure they get the most possible aid .,,,
0, simply setting an expected level of labour and business standards will therefore create improvement in those standards .,,,
0, in the case of the decent work country programme for bangladesh 2006-2009 bangladesh has been implementing the program due to its positive benefit towards achieving the millennium development goals .,,,
0, this is despite challenges such as the lack of employment opportunities in the country .,,,
0," the programme has been successful in improving social protection , working conditions and rights for female , male , and children workers in a few sectors and areas .",,,
0," when a donor nation parts with foreign aid for development to a nation , it must always choose who it prefers to give it to as there is a limited pot of money to donate there needs to be a way of allocating it .",,,
0," it is not surprising therefore that countries with shared colonial histories tend to dominate aid flows , thus britain has historically given most aid to countries that were its colonies ; inmalta and cyprus received most , while india was the biggest recipient for much of the rest of the 20th century .",,,
0," further , often countries offering aid , such as the us , the uk , and the eu , require the pre-requisite of democracy or the start of a democratisation process .",,,
0," therefore , it is justified to add a pre-requisite for better standards of business and labour as it helps implementation , and principally meets the goals of the developmental aid itself .",,,
0," as long as developing nations constantly keep employing poor labour standards , it will keep putting a strain on the global economy .",,,
0, this is because other countries will be pressured to do the same just to remain competitive .,,,
0," this creates a race to the bottom effect and would create `` poor conditions and loss of freedom in the global south , and causes workers in the global north to lose their jobs to cheap outsourced labour '' .",,,
0, higher labour standards in developing countries therefore also benefits developed countries .,,,
0, however the converse is also true ; labels like ` fair trade ' provide a guarantee of ethical quality and show that consumers are willing to pay more to ensure good labour standards .,,,
1,"it has for a long time been recognized that migration is in large part caused by economic factors; people leave poorer rural areas and move to the city, they move from less developed to more developed countries.",,,
1, in each case they are looking for a better life so go to somewhere where they believe they will find it.,,,
1," it has however usually been considered that these people moving around the world in search of work are doing so mostly for themselves, instead it is increasingly clear that they are doing it as much for their families who have been left behind.",,,
1,"the flow of money from migrants has been shooting up in recent years, according to the world bank remittances topped $530 billion in 2012.",,,
1, this represents a tripling of remittances within the last decade and indeed it is likely that the amount of money being transferred is much higher as many migrants bypass banks and big money transfer companies that provide the date the world bank is using.,,,
1,with such huge amounts of money being sent home we might very well ask whether migration could be a driver of development rather than relying on aid?,,,
1, the level of flows of money recorded by the world bank is more than three times the total of global aid budgets and of course it does not have strings attached to how it is spent.,,,
1," many countries get huge amounts from remittances; india and china each received more than £60billion, the philippines and mexico both had $24billion sent, while nigeria received $21 billion.",,,
1, for the philippines in particular $24 billion would represent more than 10% of the country’s gdp.,,,
1," for some small countries this can be even higher, in liberia remittances receive the equivalent of 31% of the country’s gdp.",,,
1," the amounts are so big that several countries, including the philippines, have sent up ministries to manage the cash sent from overseas.",,,
1,clearly the proposal is not to replace all aid with no change to remittances; this would just be taking something away so would be in no way beneficial to those who receive aid.,,,
1," instead official development assistance, “grants and concessional loans for development and welfare purposes from the government sector of a donor country to a developing country or multilateral agency active in development”,  would be replaced with increased remittances.",,,
1," this would be spurred by governments taking action in several ways; providing tax breaks and incentives for those sending home remittances, and by reducing the cost of sending money home by dropping the cut taken by banks and wire transfer firms.",,,
1," the g8 has pledged to reduce the cost of global transfers to an average of 5% by 2014, which would be a significant drop from the 9% it is at the moment and the average should be brought down to the 2-3% where it would be if there was sufficient competition.",,,
1,note: for the purposes of this debate we are not going to go into detail about whether this will result in more or less money going to developing nations.,,,
1, it will be assumed that the developed countries would be giving as much by their tax breaks and reductions in costs as they would be in aid.,,,
1," this does not seem too unreasonable, oda from oecd countries was $135bln in 2011, a drop in transfer costs of 7% would save $37bln, and the rest would be made up by tax breaks and incentives.",,,
0,  changing from oda to remittances is good for freedom of choice in two ways .,,,
0, first tax breaks and other incentives will mean that migrants have more money .,,,
0," it will clearly be up to the migrant to decide if they want to or can afford to send their money home ; they can decide how much they want to send , when they want to end it , how they want to send it etc, at the other end it will be up to the individual recipient to decide how they want to spend the money received .",,,
0, secondly it is good for the freedom of choice of the taxpayer .,,,
0, at the moment they are having their choice taken away from them as they have their own money being spent by the government on someone else ; foreign countries .,,,
0," the individual taxpayer sees none of the benefit of this money and often they do n't like paying so much aid ,% of americans support cutting aid .",,,
0, rwanda has been trying to increase the size of remittances in order to increase its autonomy .,,,
0, the president paul kagame has said `` aid is never enough and we need to complement it with homegrown schemes to accelerate growth . '',,,
0, he wants `` a higher level of direct ownership in the nation 's projects '' and wants it because western donors had suspended aid .,,,
0, a change to remittances would reduce this vulnerability ; it would be much more difficult for ` donors ' to suspend the tax breaks they provide for remittances to individual countries than it is to cut aid .,,,
0, indeed remittances are noticeably stable with money still being sent home during recessions and can even be countercyclical as migrants will send more if they know things are bad back home .,,,
0, this then takes the issue out of the hands of the politicians and puts it into the hands of the people .,,,
0," there has been a lot of concern that aid , particularly from governments and international organisations , does not always help reduce poverty ; it might simply create dependence , or it prevents local enterprise .",,,
0," dambisa moyo points out that `` betweenand, when aid flows to africa were at their peak , poverty in africa rose from% to a staggering% '' .",,,
0," remittances on the other hand can be very beneficial ; they provide the money needed to start enterprises , and they are showing that the community is not dependent as its members have taken the initiative to go and find work .",,,
0, remittances have a statistically significant impact on reducing poverty .,,,
0, inthe world bank suggested that a% increase in per capita international remittances will lead to a 3.5 % decline in the share of people living in poverty .,,,
0, governments should therefore change from the method that is failing to one that is more successful at reducing poverty .,,,

1,"    since citizens are a product of educational systems as well as continuing contributors to education, to what degree should they be involved in the education of their children?",,,
1,"  some would propose that in democratic societies, citizens always have a voice in students’ education through the political process.",,,

1,"the debate between ""comprehensive sex education"" (also just called ""sex education"") and ""abstinence-only education"" is long-standing in the united states, and exists in many other societies around the world that are split between more sexually progressive groups and those that generally oppose pre-marital sex.",,,
1," comprehensive sex education programs, at least in the united states, generally emphasise that abstaining from sex is the safest way to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.",,,
1," however, comprehensive programs differ from abstinence-only programs in that they also encourage the use of condoms or other forms of contraception.",,,
1,"   abstinence-only programs are much more conservative and limited in scope, teaching abstinence from sex, usually until marriage, as a means of avoiding the risk of pregnancy and stds and of enjoying other considered benefits such as a more unique sexual bond with one's ultimate partner.",,,

1,in most common law countries any common assault (that is deliberate or reckless physical contact without consent) is illegal.,,,
1, there are however a series of exceptions to that proposition where the public interest is deemed to justify allowing such assaults.,,,
1," for example, we allow people to cause others physical harm in the name of self defence or legal war and we allow the police to cause criminals a degree of physical harm.",,,
1, in all these cases physical harm is allowed either because there is no alternative or because of the urgency of the situation.,,,
1, they may also be justified by claims that these actions are in the name of the greater good.,,,
1,another oft used example is that of 'lawful chastisement.',,,

1," that is, the use of physical punishment to chastise one's spouse or employee has long been deemed illegal harassment in almost all nations, particularly democracies.",,,
1, when milder physical punished is used to chastise children it is usually referred to as smacking or spanking.,,,
1, the law varies from country to country as to what is an acceptable level of force but very few countries (germany and sweden are notable exception) have an outright ban on parents using such force.,,,

1," in order for a punishment to be 'reasonable' it must not cause serious mental or physical damage, it must be administered only by a parent and it must be in the name of punishment – rather than say sexual pleasure or as an emotional outlet.",,,
1, the debate turns not only on the moral principle behind the legitimacy of smacking itself but also on the effects of allowing smacking on the state’s ability to police child abuse.,,,

0," the existing mechanisms to catch abusive parents are entrenched in most societies ; child abuse claims are often the result of third-party observers , often teachers , calling the police or child services .",,,
0," such a system would be expected to play a greater role in societies with a ban on smacking -- initial penalties would be financial only , to ensure that parents are taken away from their children only if they have proven themselves repeat offenders .",,,
0, this charge would only be if the child is underyears of age .,,,
0," parents who feel that smacking is an appropriate tool of discipline ` have to give up the privilege to physically discipline their children for the sake of protecting children that are n't being hit once in a blue moon or in a light way , but are really being hit day after day , many times a day '.",,,
0, only an outright ban on smacking will enhance child protection .,,,
0, the number of children reporting being beaten to the point of bruising in germany has declined fromintoinsinceafter a ban was introduced in germany .,,,

1,merit pay for state school teachers means rewarding teachers for better performance according to specific and measurable criteria.,,,
1," state schools are schools that the government provides (in the us and canada known as ‘public schools’), as opposed to ‘private schools’, which are schools created and financed by the private sector/civil society.",,,

1,"  for instance, teachers can be rewarded for individual performance and/or for the performance of their entire department/school.",,,
1," teachers can also be paid fully based on merit, or have a fixed base salary on top of which financial rewards are added whenever performance exceeds the criteria.",,,
1,"  and, teachers might be rewarded for taking on additional duties or responsibilities.",,,
1,"  in this case, we assume that merit pay means that teachers will receive individual rewards for performance on top of a some base salary, but will try to keep the arguments as general as possible.",,,
1," if the arguments refer to another case definition, it will be noted and explained.",,,
1,"  we also assume that teacher performance is assessed based on student performance, specifically how much their students improve on specified, standardized tests.",,,

0," whether it 's through sheer talent or through hard work , some teachers consistently deliver better results than other teachers .",,,
0, those teachers are more effective and efficient at providing societal value : with the same amount of work-hours they manage to more effectively educate children .,,,
0, it is therefore only just that their pay is differentiated according to the results they achieve .,,,
0," for decades now , teachers have been remunerated based on ` seniority ' .",,,
0," this means that they do n't have an incentive anymore to improve themselves , no matter how motivated they were at the beginning .",,,
0, why try to improve yourself if you have nothing to gain from it ?,,,
0, adding a financial reward for exceptional performance will motivate teachers to do their utmost to develop the knowledge and talents of their pupils .,,,
0, teaching salaries for years have remained steady or even declined .,,,
0," this made teaching as a job unattractive and so the influx of new , talented teachers halted .",,,
0," although the effect of fiscal changes on teachers ' pay has been minimal , controlling for the consequences of the financial crisis , high productivity has become central to many private sector pay schemes .",,,
0," as a result , the contrast between non-responsive pay for teachers and high rewards for talented private sector employees has become more pronounced .",,,
0," with the opportunity to increase income through performance , teacher pay can rise , making it a more attractive profession financially .",,,
0, measuring teachers ' performances will create a transparent market for teaching talent .,,,
0," underperforming teachers will be selected out because they are less in demand , unless they adapt and learn from what their competitors apparently do better .",,,
0," so , the overall quality of the teacher pool will rise and this will increase the quality of education for all students .",,,
1,sex education has been taught in schools in a range of countries around the world for nearly a century in various forms it has become a fixture in schools in most western countries.,,,
1," the specifics of the education program vary between countries, but they all generally deal with the basics of reproduction, physiological development, sexual health, practice, and safety.",,,
1," in recent decades many countries, such as germany sinceand sweden as far back as 1956, have made sex education a mandatory part of schooling, a policy that has been met with extensive criticism, particularly from religious groups.",,,
1, their criticism is that sex education is permissive toward young people’s sexual relationships and thus morally corrosive.,,,
1,opposition also derives from an objection to an extension of the state’s involvement into the family and questions of sexuality.,,,
1," in developing countries sex education schemes have developed in part at least to attempt to stem the  hiv/aids epidemic,although some religious groups have opposed these developments.",,,
1," in western nations howeversex education is not always mandatory, in  england and wales for example parents can refuse to let their children take part in some although not in all lessons which provide information about sex and reproduction.",,,
1," proponents of mandatory sex education highlight the benefits it provides in delaying the age of first intercourse, preventing sexually transmitted disease and teenage pregnancy and in providing useful information for life regarding sexuality and sexual expression.",,,
1," opponents contend that sex education encourage early sexual relationships and the risks which attend that and  should be the purview of parents, and that forcing it to be provided in schools undermines trust in the education system and harms the individuals’ relationship with the state and society.",,,
0, it was said at the beginning of the hiv/aids epidemic that the only vaccination against the virus was knowledge .,,,
0, knowledge about what is out there is essential to guarding the self .,,,
0," there are a several of ways in which this knowledge is essential ; finding out about the risks of sex is just one , having accurate information about the pleasures as well as the risks is another .",,,
0, knowledge also prevents misinformation .,,,
0," young people must be informed about sex , how it works and what the risks associated with it are , and how to access the risks and the pleasures .",,,
0," when sex is not talked about and kept behind closed doors , young people are forced often to grope around in the dark , so to speak .",,,
0," this can result in unwanted pregnancies , and even stds , some of which can be permanent , a threat to fertility or even life threatening .",,,
0, it leaves young people confused .,,,
0," the state thus owes an obligation to its citizens to prepare them adequately for their interactions in society , including those of a sexual nature .",,,
0, a mandatory sex education regime serves as a defence against misinformation about sex .,,,
0," religious organizations , most notably in the united states , promote abstinence by lying about the effectiveness of contraception and about the transmission of stds .",,,
0, when such activity is not countered by a scientific explanation of sex and sexual practices a culture of ignorance develops that can have serious negative social and health effects on those who are misinformed .,,,
0, an example of the benefits of sex education is highlighted in the case of the united states .,,,
0," in primarily liberal states where sex education is mandatory , young people are statistically more likely to be sexually active .",,,
0," at the same time in states where sex education is banned or deliberately misleading , teen pregnancy rates are much higher .",,,
0, clearly the trade-off between high promiscuity rates on the one hand and much higher rates of teen pregnancy and stds on the other stands in the favour of sex education .,,,
0, young people live now in a society which is very sexualised it has been described as a carnal jungle .,,,
0, adults need to offer guidance about negotiating a way through the messages about sex which proliferate in the mass media and consumer culture .,,,
0, underlying this discussion is controversy about what sex education should be .,,,
0," sex education has become a shorthand term for the broader subject of personal relationships , sexual health and education about sexuality it is clear that views about what sex education should be and what it should contain has changed significantly over time .",,,
0, high quality sex education should not only contain factual information about the physiological issues of sexual development and reproduction .,,,
0, it should also offer safe spaces for young people to consider the social and emotional aspects of sexuality and the social and peer pressures that arise in youth cultures .,,,
0, sex and sexual identity is fundamental part of human life .,,,
0," sexual desire , for both procreation and recreation , forms one of the core human drives that shapes behaviour .",,,
0," young people want to explore their own , and one another 's , bodies from quite an early age , long before they would be likely to settle down and get married .",,,
0," sex for almost everyone in western countries is not something exclusive to marriage , and most people have multiple sexual partners in their lifetimes .",,,
0," in order to face this reality , young people must be armed with the knowledge of what sexual intercourse entails and the pleasures and the risks inherent in it .",,,
0," sexual identity itself can be very confusing , especially for young homosexual or transgender people who may not understand their sexuality .",,,
0," a safe , objective environment in which the objective physical facts and the emotional aspects of sexual involvement and activity is provided is essential to facilitate young people to come to grips with sexual identity as it is essential for full development as a person .",,,
0," parents have a great deal of responsibility in raising children , but they are unsuited to teaching about sexuality as the resulting education will not be consistent , be biased and in some cases may not be carried out at all .",,,
0, parents tend to view their children as less sexualized ; they want them to be innocent .,,,
0," thus it is often the case that parents seek to shield their children from the realities of sex , and themselves from the young person 's developing sexuality maintaining their innocence through enforced ignorance .",,,
0," this tends to be particularly harmful to young women , as culturally boys are often expected to be more sexually active than girls , and such activity is usually considered appropriate for boys , while not so for girls .",,,
0, a double standard undoubtedly continues to exist .,,,
0," it is in the interest of the state , however , to produce well-rounded individuals who can interact with society effectively on all levels , including the sexual level .",,,
0," when parents do not provide adequate sex education , it is the state that is forced to pick up the tab to pay for std treatment and teen mothers .",,,
0," people dropping out of school due to pregnancy , and individuals who are unable to work due to debilitating venereal disease impose a steep cost on society .",,,
0, it is thus the state 's duty to provide what parents often can not for the sake of society as a whole .,,,
0, leaving sex education in the hands of parents has the further negative impact of normalizing incorrect or bigoted views regarding sexuality .,,,
0," homophobic families , for example , will not be able to provide the necessary information to homosexual children , who will suffer not only from lack of education , but also from a lack of sexual self-worth .",,,
0, mandatory sex education can right the wrongs of such misinformation and bias .,,,
0, communities and organizations that oppose sex education can actually benefit from it .,,,
0, unfortunately this is often not appreciated by the communities involved .,,,
0, one argument is that shielding children from knowledge of sex and sexual practice is disrespectful to religion .,,,
0," religious and moral abstinence is defined by the decision not to have sex , not by the absence of knowledge of the existence of sex itself .",,,
0, sex education can even be beneficial to understanding the religious and ethical perspective toward sexuality when it provides necessary discussion of the emotional aspects of sexuality .,,,
0," information simply allows people to make fuller , informed decisions .",,,
0," sex education does not serve to normalize sexual activity and lewd behavior , as religious groups fear , because everything in life is already sexualized .",,,
0, one need only watch a typical perfume ad on television to know that sexuality inculcates popular culture already .,,,
0, sex education would not lift the scales from the eyes of children entirely ; they already have some idea of what is going on .,,,
0," the danger is when they know something about sex , but not enough to be safe .",,,
0, that is why mandatory sex education is essential to people 's wellbeing .,,,
0, the research evidence from across the world is clear that sex education holds back the age of first intercourse and most certainly does not foster early promiscuity .,,,
0, the abstinence programmes that have been developed in the united states in particular have been spectacularly unsuccessful in reducing rates of sexual exploration and std and unwanted pregnancy rates .,,,
0, research has made it clear which kinds of sex education are most effective .,,,
1,"a voucher system is one in which, instead of tax revenues being distributed directly to state-managed schools, parents are issued with vouchers that can be spent on education in any school, whether it is managed by the state or not.",,,

0," state education in some areas of the uk is continuing to fail , despite increased investment .",,,
0," this will allow those pupils who are currently locked into sub-standard state education access to the private schools enjoyed by their more privileged peers , because you can spend the vouchers anywhere .",,,
0," even if private school fees can only be subsidised by the voucher scheme , most private schools are charitable organisations that do not run a profit , and so in the vast majority of circumstances the voucher will make private schools accessible to poorer families .",,,
0," state schools will , like the private schools , have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere .",,,
0," this incentivises in particular high level management , who , if the school fails , will be out of a job with a blot on their record .",,,
0," different parents have different values and priorities , and it is entirely legitimate for them to wish to pass these on to their children .",,,

1,future iterations of this idea in the united states may involve charter schools where parents of children with track records of disciplinary problems voluntarily enrol their children in a school with such a contract.,,,
1,  charter schools can state explicit requirements of students in terms of behaviour in their charter which can then be legally enforced.,,,
1," modelling the debate in this fashion may help avoid some of the parental consent issues of the debate, although it is by no means necessary for proposition to take this strategy in the debate.",,,
1, another version of this debate is to hold parents liable for the criminal actions of children during school going years.,,,
1,"  for instance, if a child is caught shop lifting, one might impose a fine on the parents in addition to punishment handed down to the child.",,,
1,"  some of the arguments below are tailored more specifically to this version of the debate, although the arguments considered can be modified to fit into either debate.",,,
1,  the assumption behind this brief is that by and large the children being discussed are those with chronic discipline problems.,,,
0,  addressing the behavioural problems of children requires active parental participation .,,,
0," however , in many cases , parents are either not fully aware of their children 's problems , or more importantly , delay the active disciplining of their children .",,,
0," this is critical , as for the cycle of negative and positive reinforcement to be effective in behaviour modification , there must be a temporal link between misbehaviour and any potential punishment .",,,
0," in a desire to avoid future fines , or whatever the penalty the parents face , there is an active incentive to not only intervene in the child 's misbehaviour , but also to do so in a timely way , which is the most proven way to change children 's behaviour .",,,
0," moreover , if there is any tendency for parents to overlook or avoid the problems of chronically unruly children , this serves as an impetus for keeping up with discipline notices and paying attention to the child 's infractions .",,,
0, a lack of parental involvement has for example regularly been cited as being partially to blame for the riots in the uk during august.,,,
0," in order for a child 's misbehaviour to be successfully remedied , the child must receive a consistent message on what is appropriate both at home and at school .",,,
0, in many instances parents may condone behaviour that schools and teacher find unacceptable .,,,
0," in other instances , professionals at schools can aid parents in targeting specific behaviours to work on in a specific order in a program that integrates the child 's behaviour at both school and home .",,,
0," moreover , uniform and consistent rewards and negative reinforcements from school and home are tremendously useful for helping rehabilitate a child 's behaviour .",,,
0," when initiating such programs , the major problem is often that the parents give in and do not adhere to the agreed upon program , which serves to teach the child that unacceptable behaviour is sometimes condonable .",,,
0," it 's understandable that parents , who must be with the children a majority of the time , sometimes may find it easier to simply give in and pacify the child and inadvertently award destructive behaviour .",,,
0," therefore , a system of parental investment , as proposed here , will ensure that the parents have something riding on sticking to a disciplinary program as well , which ultimately aids the child .",,,
0," in the case of parents being penalized for criminal offenses by children , one can modify this argument to fit by noting that often juvenile facilities will use schools as part of a behavioural modification program , therefore the consistency noted above is still critical .",,,
0," often , children who have been trapped in a cycle of lack of discipline and disciplinary problems tend not to care about their punishment .",,,
0," detention may be seen as a welcome respite from classes , and other punishments over time may cease to make an impression on the child .",,,
0," after all , there is only so much that an institution can do to discipline a child .",,,
0, using this mechanism opens up a far more effective repertoire of discipline .,,,
0," more importantly , while the child may cease to regard any punishments handed down on him or her , often there will still be a desire to avoid actively harming the parents , which occurs under this system .",,,
0, the argument also extends in the case of criminal punishments .,,,
0," in the psychology of a child , he or she may not fully internalize the effects on their future a shoplifting arrest may have .",,,
0," however , the thought of their parents being punished in such an offense may lead to the deterrence necessary to prevent such actions .",,,
0," in effect , the argument is that when punishments to the child him or herself fail to act as a deterrent , the child seeing punishments imposed on the parents as a result of his or her actions may reinvigorate the deterrent effect .",,,
0," in addition , this allows an extra tool in the teacher 's arsenal , and the mere thought of perhaps `` triggering '' a parental punishment may help bring some children into line .",,,
0," in most cases , in which the child is not subject to some sort of constitutional problem , genetic condition or otherwise , the disruptive behaviour of a child is a reflection of in adequate parental intervention over time .",,,
0," a normal child under normal circumstances should be expected to conform to behavioural expectations , and the failure to do so represents a partial inadequate job by the parents .",,,
0, the result is a cost that is transmitted to society .,,,
0, children that are disruptive in school or in society via the criminal justice system cost the system extra money either in school resources and time or judicial-police resources as well as in the more obvious costs such as fixing vandalism and graffiti .,,,
0," even worse ; if a student drops out as a result of his discipline problems the cost to society has been estimated as $ 232,000-388 ,000 .",,,
0," given that the parent is in part to blame for failing to control the child 's behaviour , in the time during which the parent is the primary custodian of the child , it is fair to pass on a measure of this cost to the parent .",,,
1,"the seychelles are an archipelago in the indian ocean, northeast of madagascar.",,,
1," it is one of the smallest countries in the world at onlykm2, its population is also comparatively small at only 90,000.",,,
1," many of the islands that make up the country are flat reefs, though not all – its highest point is 905m above sea level.",,,
1," as with many other small island states around the world, particularly maldives, kiribati, and tuvalu the whole country is under threat from climate change.",,,
1, unlike tuvalu and kiribati the problem is not simply sea level rise meaning the whole country could end up underwater; unlike those island states the country does have some higher ground.,,,
1, instead the problem is that the remaining land will become uninhabitable.,,,
1," there is some sea level rise, but the problem is as much about erosion as a result of more intense storms, and higher and stronger tides.",,,
1,percent of the population lives on the coast but moving into the higher areas is not an option as the country would be left with few resources and almost no fresh water supply.,,,
1,so far no country has ceased to exist as a result of climate change.,,,
1, yet it has become increasingly clear that climate change talks are not going to result in deep and fast enough cuts in emissions to prevent some sea level rise so the position of the small island states will increasingly become untenable as their islands become uninhabitable.,,,
1, the search is therefore on for solutions.,,,
1, the most obvious scenario is that these states will simple cease to exist and their people will become climate refugees.,,,
1," there have been some immense estimates that there could bemillion climate refugees by– but even if this were to happen the vast majority would be internal refugees, and not members of a disappearing state.",,,
1, thus there may well be 20million refugees as a result of parts of bangladesh being underwater but bangladesh would still exist – those refugees would still have other areas of the country where they could go.,,,
1, the citizens of the small island states would be in a different situation as the nation they are citizens of would no longer exist; instead they would probably have to be taken in by neighbours although this might prove problematic because the refugee convention does not cover victims of natural disasters.,,,
1,"traditionally the four elements of statehood are having a defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.",,,
1, climate change threatens to damage the defined territory to the point that the second is no longer possible.,,,
1, this in turn is likely to jeopardise an effective government.,,,
1, only the last criterion is not initially under threat.,,,
1, so how might a state maintain these criteria when its defined territory is disappearing?,,,
1," the proposal would be that the seychelles should buy, or otherwise acquire, territory from another bigger state.",,,
1," this state would cede some, or all, sovereignty over this territory.",,,
1, the territory would probably be a similar size or possibly if less economically viable slightly bigger than the current territory.,,,
1, ideally the ceded territory would be islands or coastal so that the current skills of the people of the seychelles are still relevant.,,,
1, given the small size of the state it is likely uninhabited land could be found.,,,
1," however any current inhabitants would be allowed to remain, with the possibility that their current state might maintain sovereignty over them.",,,
1,n.b. the arguments here could be used for any small state that is going to no longer exist as a result of climate change.,,,
1,"allowing the current natives to remain, and for the possibility of contiguous sovereignty by two states over the same territory, opens up a lot of questions that have not been sufficiently explored here.",,,
1," the alternative that they be expelled, citizenship, or essentially become migrants however would make any deal much less likely to be acceptable.",,,
0, it is clear that if the seychelles wishes to remain as a sovereign nation it will have to relocate almost all of its population and it makes sense for this to be in one place so keeping the nation together .,,,
0, the way to do this is through purchasing land and sovereignty from another country that has land to spare .,,,
0, there is clearly little other choice and some of the small island states have already accepted this .,,,
0, kiribati for example has already bought land from fiji with the intent of using it as a last resort for its people .,,,
0," the seychelles , as with the other nations whose very existence is threatened by climate change , is small .",,,
0," it is twice the size of washington d.c. , so smaller than many cities .",,,
0, as such finding enough land to relocate the country should not be a problem .,,,
0," several of the states closest to the seychelles ; kenya , tanzania , somalia , and madagascar , have plenty of land that they could give up without any inconvenience to their own state .",,,
0," kenya , the smallest , is more thantimes bigger than seychelles .",,,
0, if there are no countries willing to cede complete sovereignty over territory then some kind of shared sovereignty could be considered .,,,
0," `` this conferred jurisdiction must include rights to become a citizen , migrate , work , access health care , and access social security . ''",,,
0," additionally there would almost certainly need to be sovereignty over justice , law and order .",,,
0, however this would potentially leave large areas of sovereignty in the remit of the host nation ; such as providing defense .,,,
0, the most notable compromise by both might be to maintain sovereignty over people rather than just territory .,,,
0," there have been suggestions such as by krasner that shared sovereignty should be considered , and become much more normal .",,,
0," and some forms of shared sovereignty have happened before such as foreign control over some tax revenues , or the status of forces agreements the usa had with germany that restricted german ability to make war after wwii .",,,
0, or more obviously the members of the eu increasingly cede some sovereignty to the international entity .,,,
0, as the deal would be voluntary for both the seychelles and its host country and both would potentially gain such a deal would seem feasible .,,,
0," the president of vanuatu has noted `` if such a tragedy , the disappearance of a state , should happen , then the united nations and its members will have failed in their first and most basic duty to a member and its innocent people , as stated in articleof the charter of the united nations . ''",,,
0," as long ago asdeveloped nations accepted `` the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit to sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command '' and that `` polluter should , in principle , bear the cost of pollution '' .",,,
0," there is also a convention on the reduction of statelessness in which articledemands that any redrawing of borders must not render a person stateless , the principle behind which would equally apply to a disappearing state .",,,
0, the small island states are losing their countries through no fault of their own it is therefore the responsibility of other states to provide them with alternatives ; be this land or the resources to purchase land .,,,
1,the latest report (fifth) from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) put the blame for climate change firmly on humanity.,,,
1, the chair of the working group on physical science notes “we give very relevant guidance on the total amount of carbon that can't be emitted to stay to 1.5 or 2⁰c. we are not on the path that would lead us to respect that warming target” leading to the un secretary general stating “the heat is on.,,,
1, we must act.”,,,
1, past experience however shows they won’t.,,,
1,the most obvious alternative is to accept that climate change is coming and to begin preparing for it.,,,
1," adaptation is “adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.”",,,
1, adaptation is often thought of being purely physical; building higher sea walls and more resilient infrastructure.,,,
1," but it is much more than that including “diversification of livelihood activities, institutions both formal and informal, adjustments in farming operations… seasonal forecasts… having adequate grain reserves, weather insurance, food price subsidies” etc. this means that adaptation can mean anything from new methods of farming to migrating to areas that are going to see more, not less rainfall.",,,
1,however any such adaptation is going to be costly so the question of ‘who pays?’,,,
1, is as prominent in adaptation as it was in reducing emissions.,,,
1, in the doha summit ofprime minister hailemariam of ethiopia pointed out that rather than new pledges “we are going to push especially for the powerful countries to implement previous decisions.”,,,
1, the green climate fund is supposed to receive $100billion per year bybut funding is barely reaching $10billion per year.,,,
1," there is no way to force countries to stump up funds to help others prevent the effects of climate change but should the developed world consider itself obliged to meet its obligations and fund adaptation, particularly for the poorest and hardest hit such as africa?",,,
0," lives are already being lost to climate change ; a report by climate vulnerability monitor estimates that already almost 5million are lost per year to climate change , even without the distorting numbers from pollution there are 400,000 deaths per year .",,,

0, funding for adaptation to africa inwas only $ 454milliion .,,,
0, this is not a gap that africa can make up itself ; inall spending on education was less than $ 50billion .,,,
0, africa ca n't afford to adapt itself while responding to an expanding population as well as its existing problems of poverty and disease .,,,
0, it is clear that developed countries that do have the resources have to step it and take responsibility .,,,
0, the ipcc says that it is `` extremely likely '' that human activities are the cause of the temperature rise .,,,
0, this means the biggest historical emitters have a responsibility to pay for the consequences .,,,
0," fromtothe united states produced 314,772 million metric tonnes of co2 compared to china 's 89,243 million metric tonnes and while india now produces more co2 germany over the same period emitted three times as much .",,,

1,nuclear energy is one of the main sources of energy in today’s european union.,,,
1, currentlyeu countries use nuclear power plants to produce electrical energy.,,,
1, togetherpower plant blocks are deployed with total output of more thangw.,,,
1, the produced energy of these plants covers 28.5% of eu’s energy consumption as of 2010.,,,
1, nuclear power plants are therefore currently a vital component in providing the eu with electric energy.,,,
1," however, after the fukushima accident inmany started calling for the end of nuclear energy in the eu, thus adding to the discussion started long ago as a result of worries about nuclear disasters and nuclear waste.",,,
1, for instance germany in direct response to fukushima accident decided to speed up its planned phase out nuclear power plants by 2022.,,,
1, in the uk on the other hand in octoberagreed the construction of the uk’s first new nuclear power plant in twenty years and there may be more to come.,,,
1, the question of what to do with nuclear energy in the european union is therefore a current debate that affects countries all over the union.,,,
1, in this debate we will look upon arguments in favour and against closing all nuclear power plants in the eu and substituting them with other forms of energy production.,,,
1," of course this cannot be done overnight, thus we are dealing with long-term time frame (about a decade).",,,
0," while nuclear power it is often proclaimed as clean this does not mean it is a renewable resource like wind , wave , or solar power .",,,
0," nuclear power plants use uranium to produce energy , which , of course , needs to be mined .",,,
0, currently only 2.3 % of uranium used in reactors in eu is mined in the eu .,,,
0," moreover , the world 's main uranium deposits are located outside the eu .",,,
0, the use of nuclear energy thus undermines energy self-sufficiency of the eu .,,,
0, this may pose a serious threat to the future .,,,
0," natural , and other , resources are usually used as the first intermediates of diplomatic disputes .",,,
0," when a country wants to exert diplomatic pressure on another country , or bloc of countries like eu , trade bans or embargos are widely used .",,,
0, for example inrussia stopped gas supply to ukraine due to trade dispute between their two national gas companies .,,,
0," therefore , the supply of uranium may be susceptible to diplomatic and trade relations , which are often volatile , and consequently nuclear power may not be reliable .",,,
0, is it one of the aims of the eu to become less dependent on imported material needed for energy production .,,,
0, as a non renewable resource we also need to think about the possibility of supplies running out .,,,
0, the concept of ` peak uranium ' is sometimes overblown but there is only ayears supply of uranium at current consumption rates .,,,
0," if the price gets high enough then there are other options for production , including from seawater , but this would clearly mean a big increase in cost and concerns that producers will try to keep cheaper uranium to themselves and export for much higher prices .",,,
0," thus over longer term the nuclear energy may become far more expensive , or even unavailable due to lack of fuel .",,,
0," in order not to harm environment , not to cause climate changes , renewable power plants , wind , water , solar , should be used .",,,
0," however , these do not work together with nuclear power plants .",,,
0," nuclear plants -- giant very hot machines -- are designed to operate at full speed ,% , all the time .",,,
0, they are not designed to change the output quickly .,,,
0," since they are very expensive to build , they are not economic unless operated at full speed , also turning off and on is expensive .",,,
0," solar and wind power plants are not stable , output varies because of natural factors , and thus need a backup , called a baseload .",,,
0, nuclear plants are not a good backup for renewables .,,,
0, we need nimble plants in order to support wind and solar plants .,,,
0," nuclear power stations do not work with solar , wind and water power stations , because they are running at full speed all the time , because of economic and technical reasons .",,,
0, instead gas plants that can be powered up and down as required are needed to balance power generation .,,,
0, if we want to move towards green world -- nuclear energy does not help us to do so .,,,
0, it is generally agreed that we want more renewable power generation in europe even if there are disagreements about where plants should be situated or how much must come from renewable sources .,,,
0, the european union aims to have% of energy from renewable sources by.,,,
0, and if it is to meet co2 reduction targets far more will be needed in following decades .,,,
0, nuclear is also not as helpful as renewables in meeting these co2 reduction targets .,,,
0," it is estimated that renewables produce 10-40g of co2 pre kwh of electricity produced , but nuclear is currently much higher at 90-140g / kwh , though still only a tenth of coal .",,,
0, and as mining becomes more difficult it is estimated that this could double making nuclear no better for reducing co2 than gas power .,,,
0, in the response to fukushima accident european commission carried out a series of stress tests on nuclear power plants in the eu to minimise the risk of such an accident occurring in the eu .,,,
0, the results were disturbing .,,,
0, according to the report european power plants are not well prepared for an emergency situation .,,,
0, some of the power plants would have less than hour to restore safety systems in case of electric blackout .,,,
0," currently more than 100,000 citizens live in proximity ,km , ofreactors .",,,
0," should anything go wrong , many lives would be endangered .",,,
0, the problems could be resolved by dramatic investments into the safety measures .,,,
0," however , these investments would require approximately $bn .",,,

1, the issue of the ownership of fishing rights is also important but will not be touched on here as it has received far less coverage and comment in the current climate.,,,
1,"the various attempts that have been made so far to extend the claims of arctic nations to greater parts of the sea bed and ocean, as well as efforts to rapidly increase drilling within domestic territory, has led many – environmentalists and others – to suggest that a treaty is needed to protect the whole of the arctic.",,,
1, this could be modelled on the antarctic treaty which freezes territorial claims and bans any military activity in the region; this would not affect current territory but would prevent any militarisation of the arctic ocean.,,,

0, as we are using the resources of so much of the planet we should think about our legacy to future generations and leave the resources of the arctic to future generations .,,,
0, there are several reasons why we should do so .,,,
0, first of all drilling in the arctic means drilling in some of the harshest conditions on earth ; with many of the projects being set up it means drilling in deep areas of the ocean that were inaccessible only a couple of decades ago .,,,
0, it also means drilling in freezing conditions while being potentially vulnerable to icebergs .,,,
0, disasters like the deepwater horizon in the gulf of mexico have shown that oil companies are not prepared for oil disasters in deep water and repair would be more difficult a long way from civilization .,,,
0, while the technology for this does not yet exist in future it probably will .,,,
0, it makes sense that we should leave such hard to reach resources until it is possible to extract it easily and safely .,,,
0, in the mean time we should be focusing our efforts on easier to reach resources and on developing alternatives .,,,
0, such a policy will be beneficial to future generations both through making a greener economy and by leaving an emergency reserve of fossil fuel that can be used if necessary .,,,
0, mineral extraction is not a clean process and the arctic is acknowledged as a fragile ecosystem .,,,
0," in addition to the pollution that using these fuels will cause elsewhere in the world , the process of extraction itself is fraught with risks .",,,
0," there is some destruction caused simply by the process of building and running rigs with everything running normally , but the nightmare scenario is a major spill .",,,
0," let 's be clear , with the best will in the world , there will be a spill ; difficult and unpredictable conditions , gruelling tests for both the machinery and the engineers that manage it , and a track record that leaves a lot to be desired in far more habitable and accessible environments .",,,
0," there are two difficulties posed in terms of an off-shore , or below-ice in this case , spill .",,,
0," the first problem is that stopping the spill would be vastly more complicated logistically than anything previously attempted , making previous deep-sea containment exercises seem simple by comparison .",,,
0, the exxon valdez disaster showed the large scale damage that oil spills near the poles can have large and long lasting effects on the ecosystem ; hundreds of thousands of seabirds were killed in the spill and it is estimates some habitats will takeyears to recover .,,,
0, any such disaster is made much worse above the arctic circle because of the cold .,,,
0," oil degrades faster in warmer waters because the metabolism of microbes that break the oil down works much more slowly in the cold arctic waters , at the same time the oil spreads out less so provides less surface area .",,,
0," init was reported that more than two decades after the spill there were still 23,000 gallons of relatively un-weathered oil in prince william sound .",,,
0," the second issue , as demonstrated by large scale experimentation in the 1970s is that the oil would interact with the polar ice to affect a far larger area than would normally be the case .",,,
0," at the very least , it seems sensible to have a moratorium on sub-glacial drilling until the technology is available to deal safely and securely with a spill .",,,
0, the opening up of the arctic ocean through climate change also opens up territorial claims as where there are resources at stake states are keen to make a claim so as to exploit them .,,,
0, for example inrussia 's then president medvedev stated `` our first and fundamental task is to turn the arctic into a resource base for russia in the 21st century . '',,,
0, such competition for resources can lead to conflict as is increasingly being shown in the east and south china seas .,,,
0," the antarctic treaty however freezes these territorial claims , as would our proposed treaty .",,,
0, it also bans military activity so preventing any completion from getting out of hand .,,,
0, the proposal would also ban the exploitation of the arctic 's resources so reducing the cause of any conflict .,,,

0, the foundation of islam is potentially an example of this .,,,
0, some scholars such as tom holland have attempted to show that the arab empire gave birth to islam rather than the other way around as it is traditionally understood .,,,
0, possible revisions of the early history of islam are extremely controversial but in light of the conflicts in the middle east and what is sometimes described as a clash of civilizations between the west and islam it is important that the period be studied .,,,
0, holland suggests that the prophet may have been much more influenced by christianity and judaism than is recognised by islam ; if there were such links might unearthing them not help to heal divides today ?,,,

0," nationalism scholar benedict anderson has dubbed nations ` imagined communities ' because `` members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members , meet them , or even hear of them , yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion . ''",,,
0, this is the case with all large scale communities .,,,
0," `` the nation is always conceived as a deep , horizontal comradeship '' a fraternity for which members are willing to kill and die .",,,

0, turkey will not cease being the turkish nation simply because views of atatürk change as a result of some believing him to be a ` drunken debaucher ' .,,,
0, other countries have come to accept negative parts of their history with little consequence for their conception of the nation such as the uk 's acceptance that imperialism was in large part negative it simply creates a more nuanced view of the past .,,,
0, while the state may like to whitewash history to produce its own ` national history ' that sticks to one grand narrative that is about the state this is not history as it really is .,,,
0, while a national history full of patriotism may be good for instilling a love of the nation it is not much use at teaching anything else .,,,
0, in particular it is damaging to any attempt to teach analysis and the use of sources through history .,,,
0," history is for the most part not useful in and of itself , there are for example very few jobs directly working with history .",,,
0," rather teaching of history emphasises ` transferrable skills ' such as critical analysis , reasoning and argument all of which are suppressed if focused on one officially approved narrative .",,,
0, moreover having the darker side of a nation 's past both makes history more interesting and more believable and so making it more likely that those being taught it will relate to it .,,,
0, making the past look whiter than white simply makes it seem out of touch with reality .,,,
0, it makes for a poor teacher as history needs to ` teach by example ' and if that example is not a complex character that can be related to it has little relation to every day experience .,,,
1,the british media has long resisted any formal regulation as an industry and many feel that there has been a tendency among some members of the profession to abuse this fact.,,,
1, certainly the british tabloid press has a reputation worldwide for being more aggressive and invasive than many comparable publications around the world.,,,
1," the scandal led to the closure of the sunday paper the news of the world (now) and has now engulfed the whole of news international, seeing both rupert and james murdoch facing questions from a parliamentary committee and arrest warrants being handed out to senior staff.",,,
1,proponents of greater regulation point not only to the excesses of the tabloid press- of which phone hacking is simply the most recent example- but to their obsession with celebrity gossip and the extents to which they will go to get it.,,,
1," for example the paparazzi associated with the british tabloids were widely criticised for the pursuit of princess diana, actions which were believed by many to have led to her death.",,,
1, it has also been alleged that they are quicker to publish stories than to retract them when they are demonstrated to be false.,,,
1,the issue is far from simple.,,,
1," as alan rusbridger, editor of the left-liberal daily broadsheet the guardian, pointed out to the inquiry, it was an investigative journalist that broke the story of phone-hacking.",,,
1, the right-wing daily mail also vaulted its role in bringing the murderers of stephen lawrence to book after extensive campaigning during and after the police’s investigation into the crime.,,,
1,an additional complicating factor was the involvement of senior figures in the british establishment- notably politicians and senior police officers- in varying degrees of collusion with the media.,,,
1," this last factor is particularly difficult, as it raises the issue of who would be in a position to regulate the press.",,,
1, it will clearly impact upon the ability of the media to root out corruption in either political circles or within the police force or judiciary if any of those bodies has direct control over them.,,,
1, on the other hand they have proved spectacularly incapable of regulating themselves.,,,
1,"on a practical note, it is tempting to commit a slippery slope fallacy in this debate – the idea that regulating the press is the first step on the road to a totalitarian state where the media is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the government.",,,
1, there may well be some truth in this but it is important not to overplay it.,,,
0, in the age of the internet and with no shortage of opposition politicians it would be hard to see how the tabloid press could be much more slavishly loyal to whichever party they may have chosen to back at a given time.,,,
0,"the phone hacking scandal is simply a new low in the recent , tawdry life of the tabloid press .",,,
0," as the leveson inquiry is discovering , the use of private detectives , bribing police officers , and trailing the children of celebrities all seem to be common tricks not just for the news of the world but for tabloid journalism as an industry .",,,
0, the media increasingly resembles one of the drug addicts it is usually so keen to condemn .,,,
0," as competition over dwindling advertising revenue becomes increasingly bitter , papers become ever more desperate for the next hit story -- normally represented by celebrity gossip or a minor scandal .",,,
0, such content has nothing to do with bold investigative journalism and everything to do with muck-racking for salacious stories and - when that does n't work - simply fabricating them .,,,
0, creating the impression that millie dowler was still alive was simply the most grotesque of a series of activities that put sales way ahead of truth .,,,
0," in an age when any fool with a cell phone and a twitter account can snap a topless pop star on the beach , tabloid hacks are under greater pressure than ever to go the extra mile .",,,
0, there is little reason to doubt that they will .,,,
0, privacy is already one of the dominant legal issues of our age that looks likely to become ever more the case .,,,

1," by cancelling not just the visit, but also the video link, the organisers and rushdie have further emboldened the fanatical elements in india and sent them the message that these kind of scare tactics are indeed an effective way of pressurising people into silence.",,,
1,this issue is said to have ‘divided muslims from westerners along the fault line of culture’ and pits the western value of freedom of expression against the view of many muslims that nobody should be permitted to insult or malign the muslim faith.,,,
0, society has a right to choose and structure its values as it sees fit and there is no reason why the western construction of values is right or should take priority over any other .,,,
0, in muslim countries faith may be a more important aspect of life that it might be in western countries and it is entirely legitimate that those societies might choose to value protecting the dignity of their faith over absolute freedom of speech .,,,
0, india 's post-independence history is one of partition along religious grounds with pakistan and then open warfare with that state over territory .,,,
0," there is still a large muslim minority in india and there are deep underlying social tensions within the country on this basis , along with frosty relations with a nuclear-capable pakistan .",,,
0," in this context , india 's leaders have a special reason to pay attention to the sensibilities of their minority populations .",,,

0," tuning in , specifically to be offended by something that the viewer had been warned they might find offensive seems perverse .",,,
0," by contrast , art lovers who wished to see the production - which had received four lawrence olivier awards among other tributes -- had the opportunity to experience a theatrical work they would have had a limited opportunity to witness had it not been broadcast nationally .",,,

0," if religious opinion is to be granted this airtime for the benefit of a small , if vocal , minority then it seems both unfair and unprofessional for that broadcaster to be constrained by that groups views in relation to the rest of its output .",,,
0," the bbc , like most major broadcasters , meets the challenge of divergent or conflicting views by providing some output that is considered likely to be of interest to each viewpoint .",,,
0," the bbc is in an unusual position , simply because of its funding structure , to promote new or challenging works of art .",,,
0, the licence fee means that it is freed of many of the pressures brought to bear by either commercial or political masters .,,,
0," although it has never taken that to mean it has a carte blanche , it does allow for opportunities simply not available to many broadcasters in terms showcasing new works of art and encouraging creative development .",,,
0, it seems reasonable to suggest that many of those millions follow the bbc because they trust the corporation 's approach of providing the widest possible range of output and opinion .,,,
0, for such an organisation to capitulate to a prudish group -- who were outside bbc venues at the time so could n't have seen the broadcast -- would be a huge betrayal of that trust .,,,
0, the bbc would quickly be left with a content either devoid of interest or of content were it to allow such a veto to become normative .,,,
0," especially were it , as appears to be the case here , to offer such a veto to people who did n't watch the programme .",,,

1,human rights come from the need to protect individuals from the arbitrary power of the state.,,,
1," human rights are “international norms that help to protect all people everywhere from severe political, legal, and social abuses.”",,,

1," this listed a large number of political, social and economic rights that are supposed to be universally held.",,,
1, despite this there is no universally followed list of rights and there is the possibility that more human rights may over time become recognised or become necessary where there was not the need before.,,,
1, internet access is an obvious example of this; the internet was only invented inand the world wide web in 1989.,,,
1, as the internet has become a vital conduit for information only in the last decade it could not have been considered a human right only a few decades ago.,,,
1,just as there is no definitive list of human rights that is universally recognised what exactly the criteria for what a right into a human right is open for dispute.,,,
1, the human rights reference handbook characterises them as being:several other features of human rights may also be added to these.,,,
1," they are based upon the relationship between government and the people rather than two individuals, and the responsibility for these rights primarily falls upon the government.",,,
1, they are minimal standards; what we cannot fall below rather than what we would like to have.,,,
1, as they are universal they need to have strong justifications that can apply everywhere so that they can be recognised in all cultures.,,,
1, this potentially provides a high threshold for considering a right to be a human right.,,,
1,"internet access might be considered a human right in and of itself in which case there is a need for the concept of internet access to meet the above conditions; however it could equally be argued that internet access is already a human right as a part of human rights that already exist, particularly the freedom of expression.",,,

0, the internet is becoming much more than just a tool but is becoming a fundamental part of society creating a new sphere of interaction that everyone has a right to have access to .,,,
0," creating a right to internet access would be addressing a specific contemporary problem as with other human rights that are specific such as a right to basic schooling , enshrined in articleof the universal declaration of human rights .",,,
0, not having access to the internet is similar to not having basic schooling ; it considerably narrows people 's options and their horizons .,,,
0," as tim berners-lee , the founder of the world wide web , argues `` given the many ways the web is crucial to our lives and our work , disconnection is a form of deprivation of liberty . ''",,,
0, in our traditional human rights there is a hole when it comes to a right to receive and be able to seek out information .,,,
0, almost everyone would consider freedom of speech and freedom of expression to be human rights but these rights are not very effective if there is not a way for those who wish to access that information .,,,
0, michael l best contends that articleof the universal declaration of human rights on freedom of expression implies some symmetry but that freedom of authorship is privileged over freedom of readership .,,,
0, in short governments could allow freedom of expression while ensuring that those expressing dissenting views have a very minimal audience without breaking human rights .,,,

0, access to the internet falls within this .,,,
0, the duty to respect means that governments can not block access for people wishing to use the internet to express themselves .,,,
0, the duty to protect means government should prevent others from interfering with internet users and the duty to fulfil could easily be taken just a little bit further to having to provide access to the internet .,,,

1,for a time the internet was the only uncensored outlet for criticism of governments that have the traditional media under their thumb however this rapidly changed as authoritarian governments recognised that to stay in power they need to control the internet.,,,

1," however many more countries have some form of censorship in operation, much of this involving blocking content that is perceived as being against the sitting government.anti-government protests in burma inand in iran during its“green revolution” showed the importance of the internet to protest movements with social media being used to get information out to the rest of the world as well as to organise protests.",,,
1, even major news outlets and foreign diplomats gained much of their information on the protests from social networks.,,,
1, attempts by these two governments to cut the flow of information and shut the internet down during these protests also stimulated efforts to develop tools to help protestors bypass government’s censorship efforts.,,,
1, for example there was widespread coverage of a program called haystack that was created to provide a secure route to anonomise users identities and so provide a safe way to communicate with the world.,,,
1, while haystack unfortunately did not work it did provide impetus to the idea that the response from the international community to human rights violations could in part be technological.,,,

0, as a result except in extreme cases such as north korea or for particularly prominent dissidents who are locked up physical access to the internet is unlikely to be denied .,,,
0, so long as there is physical access to the internet it will be possible to help by providing ways to avoid firewalls so that they can access information their state has banned and express opinions to both the outside world and their compatriots .,,,
0, it is equally important to provide ways for these people to avoid being tracked by the authorities so as to prevent retaliation against them for evading censorship .,,,
0, while haystack was a failure there have been other projects that are receiving state department funding that may be more successful such as ` intheclear ' which provides a `` panic button '' app for smart phones allowing contents to be quickly erased and prewritten texts sent so having the dual effect of making it more difficult for those making the arrest to find out what the user was doing and raising the alarm that this person has been arrested .,,,

1, this committee was expected to be a forum for the three countries to exchange their views on history and the textbook.,,,
1, controversy abated thereafter.,,,
1, the committee continues its activities today and it has published several reference books of history drawn from discussions among experts and incorporating views from each country.,,,
1," however, there are inherent obstacles in accurately reflecting voices from abroad in texts produced as a part of a school curriculum that is one of the sites for the diffusion of national historical narratives, all the more so when these conflict with the narratives of their neighbours.",,,
1,ultimately this controversy begs a fundamental question that goes to the heart of the nature of liberal democracy and the nation-state.,,,
1, should a state be accountable to the voices of people beyond its national borders?,,,
0,- ayako komine and naoko hosokawathe japanese government is not forcing schools to teach japanese history in a way that whitewashes the japanese record in world war ii .,,,
0, in japan the ministry of education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available .,,,
0, schools are then allowed to select their textbook from a list of seven or eight textbooks that have been approved both by the ministry .,,,
0, by making this choice schools are exercising their freedom of speech in deciding what should be taught in their classrooms .,,,
0," in the case of the new history textbook , atarashii rekishi kyokasho , not a single state run junior high school adopted the textbook resulting in a mere 0.03 % of junior high school students using the textbook .",,,
0, by contrast china 's textbooks and their misrepresentations are mandatory .,,,
0, this shows that when the japanese people are given freedom of information on the issue they exercise this right responsibly .,,,
0, to state the obvious there is an immense amount of history .,,,
0, there is much more history than could ever be taught in school .,,,
0, this means there needs to be some way to cut down everything in history into a sensible sized syllabus .,,,
0," there are some obvious ways to cut down history to a manageable length ; such as concentrating on the history of the nation , focusing on certain key events , focusing on things of particular importance to today , or sometimes just on things that are considered fun and interesting .",,,
0," in the uk there have been accusations , including by the current education secretary michael gove , that british history is neglected in favour of nazi germany and the american west -- something that then avoids britain 's less than comfortable imperial past .",,,
0, it should therefore come as no surprise that japan does not highlight world war ii and in particular the bad parts of that conflict .,,,
0, does china teach about its invasion of tibet ?,,,
0," history is not about learning all history , it is not about learning particular bits of history , it is not even necessarily about learning a nations ' story , rather it is about encouraging students to think critically .",,,
0," it has been regularly shown that stuffing children with facts turns them off a subject instead there should be interaction , discussion , analysing texts from the time and analysing bias .",,,
0, the space in the textbook devoted to the issues is very limited and therefore what they mention does not matter particularly much .,,,
0, what matters therefore is how the teachers teach the issues as they will have to supplement the textbooks with other works and there is a wide range to choose from .,,,
0, what matters then is how the teachers expand on the issues within the textbook rather than the textbook itself -- the textbook could even be useful at studying the subject by providing a source to study bias on wwii .,,,
0, to some the idea of a national story may be an anachronism but history is one of the things that bind a country together .,,,
0, as benedict anderson argues nations are ` imagined communities ' as members of that nation will never know most of the members of that community or even hear about them but despite this there is conceived to be a comradeship between its members .,,,
0, the creation of a national story from the history of the nation that helps create that common unit .,,,
0, french historian ernest renan went so far as to argue that ` getting its history wrong is part of being a nation ' .,,,
0," south korean president lee myung-bak himself has argued `` a textbook of modern history should be written in a way that does not hurt our national pride , '' when criticising a south korean textbook 's interpretation of the dividing of korea .",,,
0, if this is the case it is difficult to see how there can be any objection to japan using the same principle .,,,
1,"in october 2001, an evangelical christian preacher called harry hammond started preaching in a square in bournemouth, england.",,,

0,"- timothy garton ash views on issues such as abortion , women , and what constitutes an acceptable family expressed by those who are extremely religious are simply bigoted views which are given credibility by being wrapped in a cassock .",,,
0, it is in the nature of religious belief that any set of views can adopt a religious justification and there is no objective measure against which to hold the views .,,,
0, for example the homophobic views which have common currency in many churches can be contrasted with a gay liberation trend discernible in others .,,,
0," in the light of this , it makes sense to judge the views on their own basis , regardless of the religiosity surrounding them .",,,
0," the views expressed by harry hammond , and others , need to be stripped of their religious veneer and shown that at their heart they are simply offensive .",,,
0, there is absolutely no reason why lgbt people should have to endure vitriol and condemnation as they go about their daily lives .,,,

0," it is all well and good to talk of freedom of speech but the reality is that homophobic speeches , particularly those of a religious nature , may well lead to violence .",,,
0, for example in new york there were a series of homophobic attacks after anti-gay statements by republican politicians .,,,
0, preventing hate speech helps prevent that violence from occurring so justifying restrictions on freedom of speech .,,,

0," if the speaker had been condemning black people or women they would have been arrested for public disorder if they represented an organisation that was overtly racist , it would be quite likely to be banned .",,,
0, for some reason churches that hold views on homosexuality that are comparable in their vitriol to those on race held by neo-nazi groups are not only tolerated but frequently supported by the state .,,,
0, hatred is hatred and there is no reason why homophobia should be given a free pass that would not be given to racism or sexism .,,,
0," all of the abrahamic faiths have , at their core , an authority focussed on maintaining ` the natural order ' .",,,

0,national security concerns around terrorism mean that it is necessary to have a deterrent that will help prevent the recruitment of terrorists .,,,
0, terrorism is one of the biggest threats to western countries today and this is potentially an effective way of dealing with it .,,,
0, traditional military responses to terrorism do not work due to terrorists ' underground nature and decentralised cell structure that operates throughout the world .,,,
0, it is even questionable whether ` al qaeda ' as a group exists at all except as an identity for those wanting to attack the west to operate under .,,,
0, efforts against terrorism therefore need to be aimed at preventing radicalisation and stopping individuals rather than attempting to destroy the whole group known as al qaeda .,,,
0, this law not only deters people from becoming extremists through making them think twice about visiting extremist websites but it also helps to deter promoters of extremism through denying them an audience .,,,
0, if punishing users of extremist websites prevents even a few people who would otherwise have visited these websites from doing so and setting out on a part of radicalisation that leads to terrorism then it will have been a success .,,,
0, the internet may be a free for all where all ideas and viewpoints can be found but that does not mean that all users view all these views .,,,
0, instead the internet acts as an echo chamber that encourages people to believe their own views are correct and so get more extreme rather than challenging them .,,,
0," eli pariser author of a book called the filter bubble argues that the internet forces us to consume a very narrow range of views as search engines have been personalised with the intention of letting users find what they like so two people searching for the same thing on google can get very different results , for example when googling ` bp ' during the oil spill one person might be directed to information about the spill and its environmental consequences while another might get just investment information .",,,
0, when this kind of filtering is added to people constantly interacting with extremists and on websites praise and incite terrorism it is clear that users of these sites will get caught in a confirmation bias and conformation bias tends to lead to people becoming more polarised .,,,
0, it is therefore the right policy to punish users of extremist websites before they become too radicalised as it is only a very short step from believing an attack is praiseworthy to carrying out similar attacks .,,,
0, regardless of whether as sarkozy claims mohammed merah would himself have been stopped earlier had this law been in place at the time this law will catch some terrorists in the future and stop them before they can do large amounts of harm .,,,
0, punishing users of extremist websites will mean that the government can stop those who are on a path to radicalisation through their access to the internet and as a result this will help neutralise a key tool used by extremists to radicalise others .,,,
0, there have already been examples of people being inspired to carry out violent jihad through material online such as roshonara choudhry who after watching some of anwar al awlaki 's sermons online attempted to murder labour mp stephen timms .,,,
0, this kind of legislation would mean that he could be punished for the lesser crime thereby preventing him from being able to engage in much more damaging criminal activities .,,,
0, simply put if extremists are behind bars they are not engaging in terrorist attacks that could kill many people .,,,
1,was punk band pussy riot’s anti-putin performance in a moscow church 'religious hatred hooliganism' or an artistic form of political dissent?,,,
1, olga shvarova considers the case.,,,
1,there is another aspect to pussy riot’s case worth mentioning here.,,,
1," the russian orthodox church seemed to endorse the government’s infringement of free speech and severe punishment for the band’s performance, which in effect was a political statement, offensive not to the church but to the head of state.",,,
1," there was a blasphemous phrase in the lyrics of the song concerning god, a vulgar swear word, but one that is commonly used in everyday speech.",,,
1, the church’s attempt to invoke blasphemy in this case looks more like support for the head of state than a response to any actual offence to religion.,,,
0,- olga shvarovathe very fact that this has become a cause celebre shows the extent to which those who able to step back from the situation recognise this for what it is ; a clear abuse of presidential power given the thinnest sheen of respectability by a compliant church .,,,
0, such religious content as was contained in the protest fairly obviously relates to the setting and is not the main content of the song .,,,
0, it 's a fairly straightforward artistic device .,,,
0," it does , however , raise the question that if the intent of this song was to be blasphemous -- a necessary component of proving it to be so -- then why did they do such a bad job of it and spend so much their time going on about politics ; it would suggest somewhat incompetent activists .",,,

1,"undemocratic regimes have become some of the best customers of western surveillance tech companies and governments, using the technology to develop a firmer grip on their citizens who might seek to challenge the state.",,,
1, they have exploited the desire of democracies’ desire for profit and influence in order to make themselves even more unassailable to the forces of dissent.,,,
1, since the start of the civil war in syria there has been criticism that there have been sales of surveillance equipment to bashar al assad’s regime.,,,
1," france for example has investigated a technology company qosmos for a project that involved software that allowed the syrian government to monitor political opponents, often leading to their arrest.",,,
1," human rights groups allege that this is “complicity in torture”, if so executives could face criminal charges.",,,
1,a debate has emerged regarding the culpability of democracies in the continued oppression of people abroad.,,,
1," some states already limit their sales of surveillance technology to non-democratic regimes, such as canada and to a lesser extent the united states, though no universal bans are prevalent.",,,
1," there have been recent attempts in the us congress to change this by passing a ‘global online freedom act’ which would prevent such sales to ‘internet restricting countries’, inthis failed to pass but has been reintroduced.",,,
1," should democracies refuse to sell technology that could be used for ill to regimes abroad, or does it have more to gain from treating them as equally valid governments?",,,
1," this question forms the core of this debate, and is explored in the following arguments.",,,
0, high-tech surveillance technology has given repressive governments and police states a new lease on life .,,,
0," now more than ever they can intrude into every aspect of people 's lives , ensuring that dissent is cowed for fear of the ever present threat of the security services .",,,

0," their power has made it extremely difficult for movements for reform , government accountability , and democracy , which have foundered when faced with these sophisticated security apparatuses , valentino-devries  .",,,
0, by dominating the flow of information states have the power to keep their people in check and prevent them from ever posing a threat to their repressive status quo .,,,
0, thus china blocks access to the internet and to other forms of communications in tibet to `` ensure the absolute security of tibet 's ideological and cultural realm '' .,,,
0," it cuts the tibetan people off from outside world so as to prevent any rerun of the instability that occurred in, which china blamed on the influence of the dalai lama from outside .",,,
0, only external help in alleviating this censorship could allow activists to organize effectively and perhaps to one day bring about genuine reform and justice to their societies .,,,
0," the surveillance equipment on which these regimes rely is often only available from firms and governments in the democratic world where , by and large , technology is generally far more advanced than in the non-democratic world .",,,
0," without access to these technologies , the regimes would be far more hard-pressed to keep rigid tabs on their citizens , allowing for the seeds of dissent to take root .",,,
0," only then can the forces clamouring for democracy hope to be able to organise networks of activists , and to have their views considered by the state .",,,
0," it is common for western democracies to make sweeping statements about the universality of certain rights , and that their system of government is the one that should be most sought after in the world , that democracy is the only legitimate form of government .",,,
0, as when obama in cairo proclaimed `` these are not just american ideas ; they are human rights .,,,
0, and that is why we will support them everywhere . '',,,
0," they claim to work in the united nations and other organizations toward the improvement of rights in other countries and clamour about the need for building governments accountability around the world , using their liberal-democratic paradigm as the model .",,,
0, yet at the same time democratic governments and companies sell technologies to non-democratic allies that are used to systematically abuse the rights of citizens and to entrench the power of those avowedly illegitimate regimes .,,,
0, these hypocrisies read as a litany of shame .,,,
0, a telling example is the blair government in the united kingdom selling weapons to an oppressive regime in indonesia for the sake of political expediency even after proclaiming an ` ethical foreign policy ' .,,,
0," even if democracies do not feel it is a defensible position to actively seek to subvert all non-democratic states , and that non-democracies should be considered semi-legitimate on the basis of nations ' right to self-determination , they should still feel morally obliged not to abet those regimes by providing the very tools of oppression on which they rely .",,,
0," to continue dealing in these technologies serves only to make democratic countries ' statements hollow , and the rights they claim to uphold seem less absolute , a risk in itself to freedoms within democracies .",,,
0," respect for rights begins at home , and actively eroding them elsewhere reduces respect for them by home governments .",,,
0," corporations are private entities that have the right to sell their services and to deal with agents foreign and domestic , including governments .",,,
0," however , this right can be limited when those actions are oppositional to the aims of the home state in which they are incorporated .",,,
0, the sale of surveillance technology to undemocratic regimes stands against the avowed aims of democracies and against their strategic interests in bolstering democracy abroad and maintaining a reputation for fair dealing .,,,
0, for this reason it is perfectly legitimate for governments to ban the corporations within their borders from selling dangerous technologies to foreign governments .,,,
0," such is already the case with many kinds of strategic technology , especially weapons technology .",,,
0," the eu , for example , bans a range of arms sales to various oppressive states on these grounds , china in particular is an example where it would potentially be very lucrative to overturn the ban .",,,
0," corporations benefit from the protection of democratic states , as they provide bases of operations that shield their right to property and ensure stability and the rule of law .",,,
0, if corporations wish to benefit from these provisions they must be willing to accept the instructions of the states that house them regarding what can and can not be sold to foreign powers .,,,
0, a ban on the sale of surveillance technology to non-democracies serves ultimately as a statement of disapproval .,,,
0, it shows that the undemocratic regimes can not be trusted with the ability to spy on their people .,,,
0, this signal has several effects .,,,
0, an example of this international shaming affecting is the international bans on the use of landmines .,,,
0," various states created a framework , the ottawa convention , in which their condemnation pressured nearly every other state , including authoritarian regimes , to follow suit .",,,
0, domestically it serves to bolster people 's faith in the system of rights they value highly and enshrine in law .,,,
0, they can point to this ban as an example of their government 's desire to make a better world and not to increase repression for the sake of power or profit .,,,
0," in the undemocratic states themselves , the regime leaders will be faced with a significant public relations blow as they come under criticism .",,,
0, this serves to embolden and empower holders of dissenting opinions and to spark pro-democratic discourse .,,,
0," in the international community it makes an emphatic value judgement on the merit of certain systems of government , namely the superiority of democracy and government accountability to the people , principles most non-democracies still pay some form of lip-service to .",,,

1," it’s worth avoiding this route, as we shall see there are jurisprudential issues that apply regardless of the actuality or otherwise of blasphemy.",,,

0, of course these offences are very real and may at times be possible to codify but they can not be applied universally because the perceptions they necessitate are not universal .,,,
0, in the light of this there may be many remedies for blasphemy but legislation in general and criminal sanctions in particular can not be appropriate .,,,
0," in the case of blasphemy , such harm can not be demonstrated .",,,

1,access to information held by public bodies is a crucial component of freedom of expression and warrants a separate principle dedicated to it for several reasons.,,,
1,"first, and most importantly, access to information held by public bodies, as well as by private entities that perform public functions or receive public funds, is essential if people are to be able to participate in informed debate; hold governments accountable; protect human rights, health, public safety, and the environment; and ensure access to public goods and services on an equitable basis.",,,
1,there are two broad categories of information that people need from the government.,,,
1," we need information as consumers and users of government services, including how to access services and entitlements, and how to evaluate what services – hospitals, schools, means of transportation – are best for us.",,,
1," the public, and especially the watchdogs, also need information about how government agencies are functioning – their budgets, their outputs, their policies, the salaries of officials, contracts for outsourcing, reports of oversight bodies – in order to evaluate whether agencies are providing value for money and complying with international law, and constitutional and statutory requirements.",,,
1,"public agencies are particularly reluctant to make information available that the public could use to hold them, or key officials, accountable.",,,
1," they may also not want to make some consumer information available simply because it’s cumbersome to compile and double-check, or because disclosure of the information could expose wrongdoing or mismanagement by entities that press for secrecy.",,,
1," for instance, the us consumer agency for a long time resisted publishing complaints about products, citing the concern that some complaints might be ill-founded and that publishing the information could unfairly prejudice the manufacturer and/or lead to defamation actions.",,,
1, the agency finally agreed to publish the information in junenoting that they would include a disclaimer.,,,
1,"second, concepts such as the freedom to “receive and impart information and ideas”, mentioned in principledo not encompass the full meaning of  “access to information held by public bodies”.",,,
1," the “freedom to receive and impart information”, set forth in the universal declaration of human rights and subsequent un and regional treaties, has generally been understood to apply only to the freedom of willing entities to exchange information free from government interference, but not to address the claims of citizens and others to get information from public bodies that those bodies don’t want to disclose.",,,
1,"third, international and national experts, institutions and laws have only very recently affirmed that the right to freedom of expression includes a right of access to information held by public bodies.",,,
1," for instance, only indid the un human rights committee declare that articleof the international covenant on civil and political rights embraces a right of access to information held by public bodies.",,,
1," the committee, comprised ofexperts elected by un member states, is the body tasked with authoritatively interpreting and applying the covenant, a treaty that codifies parts of the universal declaration of human rights.",,,
1," given the newness of the international recognition of this right, its importance, and the proclivity of governments to deny an obligation to make information available, a separate principle is warranted.",,,
1,"accordingly, i would add a new principle, worded as follows:“we require information, including from public bodies, in order to be able to participate in informed debate; hold our governments accountable; protect our human rights, public safety, health and the environment; and ensure our access to public goods and services on an equitable basis.”",,,
1,"that principle responds to the points above, and also implicitly makes two additional points.",,,
1," first our need for information includes, but is not limited to, information held by public bodies.",,,
1," the un human rights committee and numerous national laws recognise that people also need information from non-public entities that perform public functions, receive public funds, are substantially government-controlled or are established by law.",,,
1," a few modern laws and constitutions, including south africa’s, recognise that people also may need information from any entity that impairs their rights.",,,
1," second, the need for information held by public bodies is not limited to citizens; rather, it is a human right, which, as freedom of expression, has both an instrumental as well as an essential value.",,,
1, it is as essential to our humanity and freedom to be able to make informed choices as it is to be able to express ourselves.,,,

1, so the question becomes: is the icc biased against africa?,,,
0,    all of the twenty-four people currently indicted are african .,,,
0," of the fifteen cases currently sitting before the court , all are african .",,,
0, this in and of itself points to a large disparity between africa and the rest of the world .,,,
0," it is also not at all true that africa is the only place worthy of investigation -- atrocities have occurred in the middle east , kosovo , chechnya , sri lanka and north korea , among others since the inception of the court .",,,
0, this is clearly because these other cases have powerful backers in the form of permanent security council members .,,,
0, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the icc feels more comfortable targeting africa then other regions where it is likely to run into opposition from powerful members of the international community .,,,
0, africa and its leaders are treated far more contemptuously by the court .,,,
0, the prospect of prosecuting barak obama for the killing of civilians by drones which amnesty international has suggested amount to war crimes or george w. bush for war crimes in iraq and afghanistan is remote -- yet omar al-bashir and uhuru kenyatta have both been indicted as sitting leaders .,,,
0, the icc will only prosecute if those who have committed war crimes are not going to be prosecuted locally but this is as much the case for western leaders as african ones .,,,
0," this points clearly to the icc proselytizing what is ` right ' and ` wrong ' to africans but not to other leaders -- treating these leaders less respectfully and blatantly undermining african nations sovereignty in a way they would not , or would dare not , for others .",,,
0," the icc can only investigate situations that are referred to it by either the host country , or the security council .",,,
0," a power also exists for the prosecutor to seek investigation , though this has as yet only been used twice .",,,
0," as such , most atrocities that occur across the world are shielded from prosecution because such a prosecution would be against the interests of a member security council .",,,
0," leaders do not seem to be brought for investigation until they offend the west ; charles taylor was not prosecuted until he had a falling out with the usa , despite their soft support for him in overthrowing the doe regime .",,,
0," another case in point is uganda where the lord 's resistance army has been charged , but not the pro-us government forces , despite evidence existing they have also committed crimes .",,,
0," it is clear then that the icc makes decisions by broad external factors , which biases it against africa which does not have any countries on the unsc or any patrons sitting on the council .",,,
1,"in many western countries, the topic of illegal immigrants sits high on the political agenda.",,,
1," this is the result of an increase in illegal immigrants residing in these countries, and the internal tensions that arise from these movements.",,,
1,"as a response, countries such as the us, canada and the eu have adopted repatriation policies for illegal immigrants.",,,
1," the policies are focused on voluntary repatriation, where an illegal immigrant gets the chance to decide for themselves to return to their country of origin, whilst receiving counselling aid and a free flight back.",,,
1," if this fails, involuntary repatriation can be considered1.",,,
1, proponents of repatriation insist a hard stance is necessary to deter future immigrants and reduce criminal activity.,,,
1, opponents maintain however that the threat is overblown and that is both more expensive and dangerous to repatriate than to integrate illegal immigrants.,,,
1,this centres around the principles and practicalities of repatriating these immigrants.,,,
0," the motion of repatriating 'all' illegal immigrants in itself implies the inclusion of involuntary repatriation, since there are bound to be illegal immigrants that do not want to go back to their home country.",,,
0,the only way to stop the problem of illegal immigration is to take a hard-line stance and adopt policies of repatriation .,,,
0," this means that illegal immigrants , after it has been proven through a fair hearing that they have no legitimate reason to stay , will be granted a period of voluntary repatriation , where they receive counselling and help to return to their country .",,,
0," if this does not work , and the illegal immigrant wants to stay , he or she will forced to repatriate .",,,
0," repatriation is needed because illegal immigrants are residing in a country which is different from their country of origin , without fulfilling the legal requirements to do so .",,,
0," they also do not make the same contributions to the state as other people do , such as paying taxes .",,,
0," this means that illegal immigrants are actively harming the legal system , the citizens of the country and legal immigrants .",,,
0," at the same time , the number of illegal immigrants is rising every year , with an estimated 11.5-12 million illegal immigrants living in the us alone1 .",,,
0, these kind of numbers show that the rules on immigration need to come with tough sanctions to ensure that they are not exploited or broken in the future .,,,
0, repatriation is necessary because it targets successful illegal immigrants and ensures a comprehensive immigration policy that aims to reduce illegal immigration .,,,
0," what this policy of repatriation will do , is that it firstly will reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the country , which will lead to a decline of harms caused by them .",,,
0," secondly , it will act as a strong deterrence for future immigrants .",,,
0, repatriation sends a message to potential illegal migrants that their presence in the country will not be tolerated and that any attempt to stay in the country illegally will be unsuccessful .,,,
0, repatriating illegal immigrants would lead to fewer opportunities for criminal networks to gain entry to the country .,,,
0," illegal immigration is linked to dangerous criminal activity such as people and drug trafficking , terrorism and the sex trade .",,,
0," an estimated000 victims of human trafficking live in industrialized countries , of whom% are forced into commercial sexual exploitation , mostly women and girls1 .",,,
0," this is both dangerous for those involved in illegal immigration but also increases the criminal activity in a country , putting lawful residents at risk .",,,
0, the state also has a duty to protect its citizens from the harms associated with illegal immigration .,,,
0," illegal immigration fuels dangerous industries such as prostitution and the drug trade , repatriating illegal immigrants cuts off a vital source of labour for these industries and could contribute to the eradication of these industries .",,,
0," illegal immigrants cost the state in money , time and resources .",,,
0," it is difficult to give an accurate number on the cost of illegal immigrants for the rest of the population , the federation for american immigration reform , fair , has come up with numbers as high as $ 1,183 per household in the state of california1 , but they are likely to put a strain on resources by not paying taxes whilst demanding social services such as healthcare and education .",,,
0," as a result , they take taxpayer 's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state .",,,
0," moreover , illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions .",,,
0, this is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down .,,,
0, removing the illegal workforce would increase the number of jobs available to lawful residents and force employers to pay fair wages and provide safe working conditions .,,,
0, failing to remove illegal immigrants undermines public confidence in the government and its migration policy .,,,
0," in the uk , opposition leader ed milliband has acknowledged that labour had lost trust in the south by underestimating the number of illegal immigrants and the impact they would have on people 's wages1 .",,,
0, people believe that allowing those who have no right to remain in the country to stay on means the whole immigration system is broken .,,,
0," legitimate migrants such as refugees , students and those with visas for work will be lumped together with illegal immigrants , and calls will grow for all forms of migration to be restricted .",,,
0," populist feeling may also be inflamed against ethnic minorities , with increased social tensions .",,,
0, all states have sovereignty -- the supreme authority within a territory.,,,
0, this includes the supreme authority to decide who should be allowed into and out of the country .,,,
0, illegal immigrants have breached that sovereignty by arriving uninvited and attempting to circumvent checks .,,,
0, these people should be deported in order to maintain the sovereignty of the nation .,,,
0, the united nations recognises the sovereign rights of members when it says `` nothing contained in the present charter shall authorize the united nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state .,,,
0, ``who is allowed to be resident in the state is an internal consideration .,,,
1,"the war in darfur refers to the civil war taking place in darfur, sudan.",,,
1," unlike the second sudanese civil war, this is believed to be an ethnic, rather than a religious war, though it has racial overtones and grew out of the existing sudanese civil war.",,,
1,the people of darfur occupied an equivocal position in that other conflict.,,,
1, like the southerners they are black.,,,
1," like the northern government and unlike their racial counterparts in the south, they are muslim.",,,
1," they largely sided with the northern forces in the civil war, but as the north moved towards a peace agreement, the darfur tribes increasingly began to resent the neglect which they felt khartoum showed to their influence.",,,
1," in february ofthey rose against the government,rather than making concessions, the sudanese government sent in military forces.",,,
1," one side of the armed conflicts is composed mainly of the sudanese military and the janjaweed, a sudanese militia group recruited mostly from the afro-arab abbala tribes of the northern rizeigat region in sudan.",,,
1, these tribes are mainly camel-herding nomads.,,,
1," the other side is composed of rebel groups, notably the sudan liberation movement/army and the justice and equality movement, recruited primarily from the non-arab fur, zaghawa, and masalit ethnic groups.",,,
1," the sudanese government, while publicly denying that it supports the janjaweed, is accused of providing financial assistance to the militia, and of participating in joint attacks targeting civilians.complicating matters is a history of conflict between the nomadic abbala, and the historically settled zaghawa and masalit, which has embittered the conflict and increased the impression that if the genocide is not the policy of khartoum it may well be that of its proxies.",,,
1,western intervention is harder than it may seem.,,,
1," for one thing, its unclear if the sudanese government could gain control of the situation even if it wished to.",,,
1," having armed the janaweed, any effort to crush them would likely face khartoum with a two-front war.",,,
1," furthermore, darfur is isolated, and there are no clear ways to support an international force even with sudanese support.",,,
1, with official opposition it might well have been impossible.,,,
1,the darfur conflict is essentially over for the moment at least.,,,
1, a darful peace agreement was drawn up by mediators at the doha peace forum in 2011.,,,
1, this was signed by the government of sudan and the liberation and justice movement onjuly 2011.,,,
1, this means that this debate is really a post-mortem about whether more should have been done more.,,,
1, there is unlikely to be any debates about what the united states should do in darfur however it may be a useful example for similar cases in the future.,,,
0," the violence that occurred in the darfur region of western sudan since, approached genocide proportions with the death toll estimated between 300,000 and 500,000 out of a population of a little over a million and a half .",,,
0," by having called the events a genocide and then failed the west discredited itself , both as a moral force , showing it cared more about se europe than it did africa , and indicated to dictators that they have no reason to fear a western response in the future .",,,
0, perhaps as damaging as the humanitarian consequences of the failure to intervene is the message it sent to other leaders considering solving their political and ethnic problems in a similar manner to khartoum .,,,
0," rather than deterring them from following in bashir 's footsteps , the west by doing nothing , gave the impression that bashir survived not through his own efforts , but because china protected him .",,,
0," given the rapid expansion of chinese influence around in africa , this makes accepting chinese investment instead of western investment vastly more attractive because in addition to the economic benefits , it is now perceived as buying chinese political cover .",,,
0," in turn , this increasing interest in seeking out chinese political cover will lead to more states being willing to imitate bashir in the future , safe the knowledge that they will not be bombed .",,,
0," while sudan has been more cooperative in recent years against al-quada , it continues to harbour islamic extremist groups responsible for attacks in egypt and saudi arabia .",,,
0," combined with the conflict in darfur there was a pressing case for regime change , and reason to think sudan 's neighbours would be open and supportive of the idea as well .",,,
0," furthermore , the tendency for resistance forces to base themselves in these refugee camps , threatened and continues to threaten to spread the war into these regions , either igniting the north-south civil war in sudan , or destabilizing chad 's government .",,,

0, it has a longer standing relationship with a european state than other african nations that were colonized ; it was first settled by the portuguese inand unlike much of africa it was uninhabited before europeans arrived .,,,

1, africa is a continent with great economic potential.,,,

1, it accounts for more than 32% of africa’s gdp and it accounts for around 65% of africa’s employment.,,,

0, but the sector does not reach its full potential .,,,
0, women do most of the work but hold none of the profit ; they can not innovate and receive salaries up to% less than men .,,,

1,crimea will on the 16th have a referendum on whether the region should join russia.,,,
1, it is almost certain that the people will ratify the decision of the crimean parliament that they want to be a region of russia not ukraine.,,,
1, ukraine has maintained that such a referendum is illegal so the crimea’s vote is likely to inflame rather than dampen the tensions between russia and ukraine that have been near the point of war since russian soldiers occupied crimea as part of a crimean self-defence force.,,,
1,it is also clear that the broader international tensions will also remain.,,,
1," the g7 (canada, france, germany, italy, japan, uk, and us) has said “any such referendum would have no legal effect… it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force… we would not recognize the outcome.”",,,
1,so is there any possible solution to the crisis.,,,
1, it is clear that russia and the united states (acting as proxy for the ukrainian government) are a long way apart on the issue.,,,
1,"  the united states wants russia to pull back its military from crimea, and also its influence including halting the referendum vote.",,,
1, moreover it wants negotiations with the current ukrainian government which russia refuses to recognise.,,,

1," assuming the crimea is as far as russia intends to go into ukraine then the maximalist positions by the two sides might be said to be for the russians; keep crimea, ukraine’s government replaced preferably with a pro-russian government.",,,
1," while ukraine’s position would be complete russian withdrawal, and elections are held at the end of the year as planned.",,,
1,so what would be the meeting point between such positions?,,,
1," russia would likely be willing to take one or the other, neither of which the west or ukraine are likely to consider a sufficient climbdown.",,,
1,the question then is how to negotiate a situation where russia gets what it wants but ukraine maintains its territorial integrity.,,,
1," the lord owen, a former british foreign secretary, suggests leasing crimea to russia.",,,
1, russia would negotiate a lease over not just sevastopol as they have now but over the whole of crimea.,,,
1, a lease would mean that the territory remains ukrainian soil but russia has complete or almost complete control over the administration of the region.,,,
1, it being a lease means that ukraine would not simply be giving up the right to administer the peninsular but would be paid for it either through cash payments or through cheap oil and gas supplies from russia.,,,
0, agreeing a lease would provide a much needed peaceful solution to the crimean crisis which would not only solve the immediate crisis but would also prevent future flare ups .,,,
0, shortly after russian forces moved into crimea prime minister arseny yatseniuk of ukraine said `` this is not a threat : this is actually the declaration of war to my country '' .,,,

0, but when there are constant tensions the best way to prevent a potentially unpredictable situation is to provide a solution to the situation .,,,
0, a lease should be considered .,,,
0, there have been many suggested motives for russia 's sending military forces into crimea .,,,
0," providing a lease on crimea to russia would provide a solution to most of russia 's main objectives ; the russians in crimea are protected , and the russian hold on its black sea base is secure .",,,
0," more importantly the crisis started after the defeat of president yanukovych and the resulting blow to russian prestige in what russia sees as a zero sum game , if one side wins the other automatically loses to the same extent .",,,
0, an invasion or crimea regained russian leverage but left russia with little room to manoeuvre as any climb-down would leave putin with nothing .,,,
0, a lease gets out of this zero sum problem as both can gain .,,,
0, a lease would enable russia to make an agreement with the ukrainian government and recognise that government without having to lose face as any other solution which maintains ukrainian territorial integrity would .,,,
0, ukraine is in a dire financial situation ; it has gone to the imf seeking $ 15billion to help stabilise the economy with a bailout .,,,
0, the interim finance minister yuri kolobov suggests that even this amount will not be enough for the full year with ukraine needing $ 34.4 billion .,,,
0, finance was one of the reasons why ukraine turned to russia in november; russia was offering money when the eu was not .,,,
0, the lease agreed for the black sea fleet involves the payment of $ 90million per year and the renegotiations ininvolved giving ukraine cut price gas as well .,,,
0," a lease for the whole of the peninsular with almostmillion inhabitants and is close to the size of belgium would cost a lot more , potentially enough to fill much of that financial hole .",,,
0, while of the core points of sovereignty is that is indivisible this has not stopped the existence of other similar deals happening in the past .,,,
0," locally the black sea fleet is a good example there have however been more famous examples in the past ; the panama canal zone was leased to the united states fromtofor $ 250,000 per year , later increased .",,,
0, there are other instances of territory being leased ; the clearest example being hong kong 's new territories which were leased rent free foryears fromafter china was defeated by japan -- at the time there was a general view that if one great power gained then all the others have to as well .,,,
0, that leasing territory is an established practice means that it should be easy to apply to this case .,,,
1,uganda hit the international headlines in lateand earlydue to controversy over an anti-gay law proposed by parliament and passed by the president.,,,
1,the initial bill commonly known as “kill the gays bill” was proposed by mp david bahati inand approved by parliament in decemberbefore being sent to the state house for final confirmation.,,,
1," mr bahati argued that he would fight to see the bill passed claiming that it was aimed at protecting children and conserving the country’s values; “because we are a god-fearing nation, we value life in a holistic way.",,,
1, it is because of those values that members of parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks”[1] he noted after the parliamentary vote to support the bill.,,,
1,despite international pressure from various countries such as the usa and uk as well as from humanitarian organisations worldwide to stop the progress of the bill uganda’s president passed it as law in february 2014.,,,
1, president museveni proclaimed he did so to show that uganda is an independent country which won’t create laws just to suit other countries agendas [2].,,,

1, the un secretary general ban ki-moon spoke against the law stressing that it violates basic human rights and endangers the lgbt community in uganda[3].,,,
1," south africa’s nobel peace prize winner desmond tutu argued that there is no scientific justification for prejudice and discrimination ever, and called on museveni to strengthen uganda's culture of human rights and justice[4].",,,
1, president obama in a written statement against the move noted; the new law “will be more than an affront and a danger to the gay community in uganda.,,,
1, it will be a step backward for all ugandans and reflect poorly on uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people”.,,,
0," it is therefore a question of concern, has the ugandan government failed its citizens on lgbt rights?",,,
0,human rights are fundamental and universal .,,,
0, they do not only apply to a certain group of people and invalid to another such as homosexuals .,,,
0, criminalising homosexuality in uganda considers all in the lgbt minority to be worse than second class citizens .,,,
0, making them almost automatically criminal renders homosexuals sub human depriving them of their identity as ugandans .,,,
0, the government has a responsibility to protect every citizen but in this case the ugandan government has taken the first step in rejecting and mistreating its own people .,,,
0," the new law infringes on fundamental rights to privacy , non-discrimination , equality and freedom from cruelty and inhumane treatment  .",,,
0, even before the bill was introduced the government prevented there being room for lgbt activists to explain their cause showing their lack of freedom of expression .,,,
0, this and rights such as equality are universal and fundamental rights that the government of uganda has on numerous occasions signed up for in the universal declaration of human rights and the african charter on human and peoples rights among other documents .,,,
0,  articleof the ugandan constitution is clear in its separation of church and state `` uganda shall not have a state religion . '',,,
0, the government must serve all its people equally regardless religious and cultural orientation .,,,
0, but this bill has been created with a religious motive .,,,
0," in his interview defending the anti-gay bill , mp david bahati lamented , that god does n't accept homosexuality quoting a bible verse that the wages of sin is death  ; as if the ugandan parliament is filled with righteous souls !",,,
0, the constitution allows freedom of religion and prohibits the creation of political parties based on religion  .,,,
0, laws and policies should therefore not base on bible verses as not everyone will share the same belief to such scriptures .,,,
0, chapterof the ugandan constitution recognises fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual as inherent and not granted by the state .,,,
0," the constitution states ; all persons are equal before and under the law in all spheres of political , economic , social and cultural life and in every other respect and shall enjoy equal protection of the law ; without prejudice , a person shall not be discriminated against on the ground of sex , race , colour , ethnic origin , tribe , birth , creed or religion , or social or economic standing , political opinion or disability  .",,,
0," it defines `` discriminate '' as giving different treatment to different persons attributable only or mainly to their respective descriptions by sex , race , colour , ethnic origin , tribe , birth , creed or religion , or social or economic standing , political opinion or disability .",,,
0," the government has acted contrary to their own law , with president museveni remarking that what homosexuals do is disgusting , un african and had no place in his country  and mp david bahati , asserting that homosexuals do not deserve to be treated as humans .",,,
0, breaching such a law while relying on such logical fallacies is a sign of how the government failed on human rights .,,,
1,on the 27th februarysoldiers seized the crimean parliament.,,,
1, they did not have insignia but raised a russian flag above the building.,,,
1, the crimean parliament then voted to dissolve the regional government and elected a new pro-russian leader sergey aksyonov.,,,
1, he promptly requested that russia provide help to ensure “peace and calm” within the crimea.,,,
1,following the ousting in a revolution of pro-russian ukrainian president yanukovych and the loss of influence this represented russia has been happy to oblige.,,,
1, russia already was engaged in a show of force with military exercises along ukraine’s borders.,,,
1, it also already had troops at its black sea fleet base in crimea.,,,
1," unmarked troops and helicopters, though believed to be russian, occupied sevastopol and other crimean airports taking over the transport infrastructure.",,,
1, in order to prevent a response from ukraine russian troops surrounded ukrainian bases and demanded they surrender.,,,
1, ukraine’s verbal response was tough with the prime minister arseny yatseniuk saying “this is not a threat: this is actually the declaration of war to my country”.,,,
1," ukraine therefore clearly believes that russia had no right to send forces into crimea, a sovereign part of the country.",,,
1," however ukraine has agreed with the calls for restraint, it has mobilised its army but has made no move to engage the russians and has refrained from allowing its troops to use force in crimea leading to tense but peaceful standoffs.",,,
1, the endgame is integration of crimea into russia.,,,
1, a referendum on the 16th march showed that 97% of voters in the crimea want to join the russian federation.,,,
1," the final result is therefore that crimea is lost to the ukraine, but there being a result does not necessarily mean russia’s actions were just and moral.",,,
1,crimea itself is a peninsula out from the south of ukraine into the black sea.,,,
1," crimea is strategic in large part because of the good harbours it has, something that russia otherwise lacks.",,,

1," a century after the crimean war inkhrushchev handed over the crimea to ukraine, the reasons are disputed, but as both were a part of the ussr it may well have simply been for convenience as there is a land bridge from ukraine but not to russia.",,,
1,history and geography are not the only causes of tensions; it is culturally and ethnically more russian than ukrainian too.,,,
1, crimea has an ethnic russian majority with 60% of the population being russians.,,,
1, 10-12% of the population is crimean tartars and firmly opposed to russia as a result of having been deported by stalin.,,,
1, the balance is mostly ukrainian.,,,
1, the language is russian and as a result most people get their news from russia.,,,
1,"russia has clear interests in crimea and has basing rights for up to 25,000 troops in sevastopol which is the main base for the black sea fleet.",,,
1, these forces in sevastopol both ensure that russia is particularly concerned about the security of the peninsular and that it has the means to make its views felt.,,,
1," it cannot be surprising then that russia, feeling its citizens and interests threatened in the province, acted using these forces that were to hand in crimea.",,,
0, president yanukovych is ukraine 's legitimate president .,,,

0, the% vote for joining russia and% turnout conclusively show that this is the will of the crimean people .,,,
0," the russian parliament has agreed to approve force `` in connection with the extraordinary situation in ukraine , the threat to the lives of citizens of the russian federation , our compatriots '' the russian federal council approved the move unanimously so allowing russian troops to be used .",,,

0, the crimean parliament has also asked to join russia and is to have a referendum to show the support of the people for this action .,,,
0," `` from today , as crimea is part of the russian federation the only legal forces here are troops of the russian federation , and any troops of the third country will be considered to be armed groups with all the associated consequences . ''",,,

0," the sources of this fdi vary , but china has become the major investor in the region , with investment rising from $billion to $billion in the past decade .",,,
0, china has helped build vast infrastructure projects in return for natural resources and food for its growing population .,,,
0, proponents of this view claim that the traditional image of ` dark africa ' is becoming outdated in the light of greater access to technology .,,,
0," due to poor infrastructure , mobile communications have had a transformative impact on african life .",,,
0," in the past decade there has been a notable increase in mobile phone ownership , with the trend set to continue .",,,
0," there are overmillion mobile phone users in africa , which is more than in north america and europe .",,,
0, mobile phones allow the use of services such as agro-info and mobile banking to further their businesses .,,,
0," it is thought that by,% of households will have a television in their house .",,,
0, household technologies becoming more available have gone hand in hand with the development of more sophisticated farming and industrial techniques .,,,
0," a recent pan-african project designed at improving legume technology and enrich low-nitrogen soils has made it possible for farmers to increase their yields and has reached 250,000 smallholder farmers so far .",,,
1,it is clear that there are a lot of very serious issues that the african governments have to solve when dealing with the threats to the population’s security.,,,
1,"  security can be narrowly or broadly defined but even when narrowly defined as protection against physical harms, such as military attacks coming from government forces or military juntas, poverty is still an issue that has a security impact.",,,
1, the global poverty line is $1.25 a day and the rate of poverty inwas less than half therate.,,,
1,million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty inthan in 1990.,,,
1," however, at the global level 1.2 billion people are still living in extreme poverty (1).",,,
1, although in absolute numbers there are more people in poverty in south asia it is sub saharan africa which has the highest rate of poverty relative to the size of the population with 48.5% of the population in poverty.,,,
1,"(2) so although poverty has diminished, it is still a very pressing issue.",,,
1,is poverty africa’s biggest security issue or is there another problem that is a bigger threat to public safety?,,,
1," poverty does have consequences for security; it leaves people vulnerable to terrorist attacks and may encourage people to join terrorist organisations, something that is even more pronounced with piracy, banditry and rebellions.",,,
1, however even if it is a security issue it may be considered to be a diminishing one as the continent is becoming richer.,,,
1, perhaps the most obvious alternative general explanation for conflict in africa are ethno-religious divides.,,,
1, there are tensions for resources and power between ethnicities and religion often adds to the volatile mix.,,,
1, while there is no one overarching problem that if it is solved will somehow solve all of africa’s problems identifying the general causes of conflicts is important in working out how to avoid such conflict in the future.,,,
1, the solution to the problem will be very different if poverty is the main problem compared to if ethnicity and religion is.,,,
1,n.b. while this debate is about africa it is also a general debate that can apply everywhere with similar conditions of poverty and a diversity of religions and ethnic groups.,,,
0, the examples for this debate are drawn from a wide range of countries some of which are outside of africa.,,,
0,"despite many problems that africa has to face , one of the biggest is its extreme poverty .",,,
0, currently more than 48.5 % of the population of sub-saharan africa lives on less than 1.25 dollars a day  .,,,
0, as a result of this poverty people 's security is being threatened on two main levels .,,,
0," on the first level of analysis , poverty can lead to crime .",,,
0, poverty can create desperation to provide for family or yourself .,,,
0," as poverty is widespread in africa , there are many people who are willing to steal , threaten , abduct or kill someone , in order to have something to eat .",,,
0," at 17.4 per 100,000 citizens , more than double the world average , africa has the highest homicide rate among all regions of the world .",,,
0,"  the other side of this is that a poor state ca n't provide the level of policing that richer states can , a people in poverty usually results in a poor government .",,,
0," this in turn means that the police force is small , badly trained and underfunded so not fit for preventing crime .",,,
0," on the second level of analysis , desperate people are much easier to manipulate .",,,
0, this makes them easy targets for military groups in africa who are searching for members to fight for their causes .,,,
0," it is not coincidental that we have so many militias and juntas in africa , such as somali pirates , aqap , aqim , al-shabab , touareg , mali , boko haram , nigeria , m23 and dozens of others .",,,
0," the militias offer those in poverty what they need most , food , shelter , and protection in return for their `` services '' .",,,
0," poverty provides an additional benefit for these groups due to the stark difference between potential reward , such as from piracy or winning control of mines , and a normal income .",,,
0, as with the drugs trade the lure of the fast buck can be used to encourage risk-taking .,,,
0," in conclusion , poverty both enables crime and encourages militia groups .",,,
0," unfortunately , there is a vicious circle , caused by poverty that many poor countries find themselves in .",,,
0," a poor country also means a poor , ill-funded government .",,,
0, such an institution is either unhelpful in preventing poverty or a road block to poverty alleviation .,,,
0, a poor population is also unfortunately more likely to lead to an autocratic government .,,,
0, this phenomenon can be shown by looking at decolonisation .,,,
0," poor countries when decolonised , even if they initially had democratic aspirations quickly fell to dictatorship .",,,
0, there are very few exceptions such as india that have managed to continually maintain a democratic government while poor .,,,
0, wealthy countries when decolonised are much more likely to become democracies and once poor autocracies become rich the pressure for democratisation usually becomes unstoppable so countries like south korea democratised as they became wealthy .,,,
0, there might be considered to be a wealth threshold about which states will become democracies .,,,
0,"  the reason why poverty is likely to lead to dictatorship is simple ; a lack of an educated , effective civil service .",,,
0, when the government is very small it ca n't effectively control the whole country or ensure accountability .,,,
0," the result , especially when civil servants are poorly paid is corruption and an opening for the army , or any populist who appears to offer a solution to take power .",,,
0, once dictatorship occurs it can usually be maintained by force until the population is educated and connected enough to engage in a democratic revolution .,,,
0, there is then a free pass for those in power to exploit their position through corruption .,,,
0," many dictators , including in africa have become very rich indeed .",,,
0," mohammed suharto , ferdinand marcos and mobutu sese seko , the former dictators of indonesia , the philippines , and dr congo , extorted up to $ 50bn , # 28bn , from their impoverished people  .",,,
0," a vicious cycle is created whereby the government needs money , so corruption and extortion are rampant .",,,
0, those in power are more concerned with their own wealth than the people which makes the government poorer and less efficient so providing more incentive to resort to illicit means of funding .,,,
0, poor nations find it difficult to sustain efficient and well-disciplined armies .,,,
0," good training and regular pay is vital for this , something that is unlikely to be forthcoming with a cash strapped government .",,,
0, yet such a disciplined army is one of the vital prerequisites for security and a stable country .,,,
0," discipline is needed to prevent the army turning on those it is supposed to protect , and it is need to secure the country from other groups both internal and external .",,,
0," poverty therefore enables rebellions , civil wars , and local warlords by helping ensure that the poor states involved do n't have the resources to control their territories .",,,
0," it should come as no surprise that ofmajor ongoing conflicts five are on the african continent , and another one if the conflict in dr congo were to be included despite it potentially being at an end .",,,
0,"  in addition to this , a poorly funded army is a threat in itself , as the lack of training of the soldiers may translate into unprofessional behaviour , such as engaging in crimes and rapes , or even worse launching a full scale coup in the hope that they will grip the power .",,,
1,"nato, the north atlantic treaty organisation, is a military alliance based on the north atlantic treaty.",,,
1," it was founded inby twelve allied countries including the united states, the united kingdom, canada and france, originally with the intention to provide collective security for europe against the soviet-led communist bloc.",,,
1," in response, the soviet union formed the warsaw pact in 1955, a rival collective security organisation led by the soviet union.",,,
1,"when the soviet union collapsed, the warsaw pact disintegrated, but nato continued existing.",,,
1," in fact, inand 2004, it expanded with many new members who originally were a member of that same rival warsaw pact, including poland (1999) and the baltic countries (estonia, latvia, lithuania, 2004).",,,
1,"through membership of nato, all member countries commit themselves to ‘mutual defense’.",,,
1, this means that all member states commit to assist another member when it comes under attack.,,,
1," formally, this assistance isn’t necessarily military, but in practice it is assumed it means military assistance.",,,
1," this idea of ‘an attack against one is an attack against all’ under nato was invoked only once, after the attacks of september 11,on the u.s.the members of nato hold regular military exercises together, with the aim to improve coordination and cooperation between their respective militaries.",,,
1," nato also issues so-called stanags (standardized agreements) which harmonize rules, procedures and equipment of the militaries of all members.",,,
1,"next to that, nato also runs the membership actions plans (map).",,,
1," countries can request to receive a map, which is a plan to put them on course to eventually joining nato as a full member.",,,
1," bosnia & herzegovina, macedonia and montenegro all have maps.",,,
1, georgia has expressed interest for a map and ukraine expressed interest until 2010.,,,
0,"  originally , nato had a clearly defined purpose and a common enemy : the soviet bloc .",,,
0," with the demise of that shared enemy , nato 's original purpose has disappeared but its well-functioning military structure remained , leaving it open to be seized by opportunistic politicians in a classic case of ` scope creep ' .",,,
0, this has happened with u.s. president george bush jr. 's push to let ukraine and georgia in as new members in his global campaign to spread democracy .,,,
0," this has only served to increase tensions with russia , see next argument .",,,
0, who is to say that something similar is n't going to happen vis-à-vis china ?,,,
0, there are two issues keeping russia cautious of nato as a military alliance .,,,
0," the first is a proposal by the u.s. to put up a missile defence system in poland , the czech republic and on warships in the black sea under the flag of nato to protect against missiles from iran or north korea , which , according to russia , would never fly over these countries in any attack .",,,
0, russia concludes that the missile defence system therefore must be directed at them .,,,
0," the second issue is nato 's plans to expand with ukraine and georgia , which russia has traditionally regarded as part of their ` sphere of influence ' .",,,
0, as russian president medvedev stated in: `` no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . '',,,
0," the clause that ` an attack against one means an attack against all ' , article v , runs the risk of entangling the entire alliance in an unwanted conflict .",,,
0," this has happened before : world war i started out as a local conflict between the austro-hungarian empire and serbia , but through their security alliances inadvertently drew in all the major powers of the world .",,,
0," given that many members of nato have unstable countries near their borders , i.e. turkey bordering iraq , there is a risk they could become involved in a small regional war , which then inadvertently draws in the entire world .",,,
0," maintaining an administration for nato , with personnel and buildings , costs money .",,,
0," moreover , whenever nato-members engage in a mission , they 're supposed to fund their activities under these missions themselves .",,,
0," given that the original threat has passed and given that the organisation still struggles to redefine itself , why spend money on it ?",,,
1,development is the sustained increase in standards of living of a country.,,,
1, there however is no individual indicator that shows that a country is considered developed.,,,
1, the proxy that is usually used is gross domestic product per capita which is the total amount a nation produces divided by the country’s population.,,,
1, this then captures the relative performance of nations and usually shows how developed a nation is.,,,
1," what it does not show however is how equally that wealth from that output is divided so it is possible that a nation that is very rich by gdp is actually not very developed if all of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of one or two people, an example of this is equatorial guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty.",,,
1, dissatisfaction with this has led to the development of the human development index for the development reports of the united nations development programme.,,,
1, these include a broader range of indicators using gross national income per capita (only slightly different from gdp) with purchasing power parity (meaning it takes in to consideration differences in prices for the same product) as a wealth component.,,,
1," it also includes life expectancy at birth for a health component, and mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling to create an educated component.",,,
1, the index is sometimes improved by adjusting for inequalities between the three.,,,
1," in either case countries tend to be categorised into very high, high, medium (with this being split into lower and upper middle in the world bank’s) and low.",,,
1, a country might be said to be fully developed when it reaches high.,,,
1, development however might simply be taken as the movement between these categories.,,,
1,"dictatorship does not automatically result in development – an increase in human wellbeing, which can be evidenced by improved education, health, lifestyles and security.",,,
1, neither does democracy.,,,
1," there are cases both of democracies that have failed to develop, such as india and bangladesh, and there are a lot of instances where autocracies have failed to develop.",,,
1," on the opposite side of the coin there are both cases where democracies have developed such as many western countries; the uk, us, france, and cases where states have developed under a more autocratic system such as south korea, singapore, and most recently china.",,,
1, it is china that is the driving force behind current debates on whether dictatorships might be better than democracies at encouraging at least the initial stages of growth.,,,
1,  there are however both advantages and disadvantages to each system when it comes to encouraging development.,,,
1," a dictatorship has greater control over people and resources allowing for more state driven economic growth, making it in a better position to develop than a democratic state.",,,
1, this is most evident in early stages of development where development is based on the production of goods.,,,
1, this will explore whether dictatorships are more likely to develop then democracies.,,,
0, dictatorships are superior to democracies in that they can make decisions and implement policies quicker .,,,
0," they can easily modify institutional and legal frameworks towards development goals , as there is no need for a political consensus behind their actions .",,,
0, this also insulates government from special interests that must be reconciled with in democracies .,,,
0," this allows dictatorships to create a pro-investment legal , economic and institutional framework such as low taxes , exchange rate manipulations and import tariffs , without facing political opposition .",,,
0," for example , fracking , a technique used to extract hard to obtain gas , has generated widespread opposition in the west , leading to it being banned in france .",,,
0," an autocratic government would find it easier to allow cheap access to this energy , boosting industry , as it could disregard this opposition .",,,
0," dictatorships can also control resources to allow for better health and education services , by determining curricula , salaries and supplies .",,,
0," cuba has one of the best healthcare systems in the world , with more doctors per capita than much of the western world , and inshanghai came first in the pisa test .",,,
0," due to the lack of rotation in office , a dictatorship allows for a more stable government with more ability to plan for the long term , which is crucial for attracting foreign investment .",,,
0," given that a democracy requires regular elections , each election can change the economic environment of a country .",,,
0," a change in government may lead to a switch in policies , partisan appointments to government bodies , and a medium term focus always set on the next election .",,,
0, close elections can lead to disorder as votes are recounted and appeals lodged in the courts .,,,
0," after themexican presidential election , tight results lead to popular unrest and mass protests calling for a recount .",,,
0," the president elect had to deal with a large legislative faction that did not recognise him , and his opponent refused to concede defeat .",,,
0," without a stable framework , the lack of foreign confidence may impede development .",,,
0," the countries that have developed rapidly have tended to be those that have managed to attract this foreign direct investment thus inchina managed to get $billion of fdi ,% of the total , against only $billion for the united states which is still a much bigger economy .",,,
0," additionally the resources needed to operate a democratic society and run elections are a large expense for the state and society as a whole ; the us presidential election costs $ 6bn , money which would be much better spent investing in building infrastructure or businesses .",,,
0, dictatorships are better at controlling discipline and order within society .,,,
0," they generally promote a state based on hierarchical values , through strict policies based on security .",,,
0," this allows them to prevent financial losses due to strikes and riots , and reduce crime rates , making the country more stable .",,,
0," singapore is a de-facto one party state , in which the ruling people 's action party , is accused of stopping the operation of opposition parties .",,,
0, a former foreign minister of singapore has asked `` how many singaporeans really want free speech anyway ?,,,
0," they want orderliness , a decent living '' .",,,
0, this both makes the country more competitive because there are more productive days and more attractive to invest in as expats will want to live in countries with little crime .,,,
0, moreover when it comes to attracting immigration for sectors of the economy there is none of the opposition that would occur in democracies .,,,
0, autocracy may be the only way to stabilize some countries that have never had a democratic government .,,,
0," it has been suggested by mancur olson , a leading economist , that `` anarchy not only involves loss of life but also increases the incentives to steal and to defend against theft , and thereby reduces the incentive to produce '' .",,,
0, a dictatorship may be the only way to restore order and create a political framework stable enough for trade and investment .,,,
1,the european union has since its inception had european integration beyond trade as its overarching goal.,,,
1," in recent years, it has moved towards an increasingly closer political union.",,,
1," many political competences that used to belong to nations have been transferred to permanent eu institutions such as the council of the eu, the european parliament, and the european commission.",,,
1," in other words, the eu has gained increasing legislative and fiscal power, so that member states and their citizens are legally bound to follow eu laws which span increasingly contentious areas.",,,
1," these include budget regulations through the maastricht criteria, but go beyond them: it is hard to think of an area of policy where the eu is not active (1).",,,
1, the eu is therefore already a political union.,,,
1,"since the beginning of the euro crisis, there has been pressure from some member states, and notably germany and france, to move towards an ever closer political union (2).",,,
1, although they don’t yet exist common fiscal policies and a banking union can be seen as prerequisites to a sustainable eurozone – but shared education and law enforcement policies are also important for trade and interaction within the eu.,,,
1, further political integration is therefore being considered as a possible response to the crisis in the eurozone.,,,
1,"however, this sentiment is not shared by all.",,,
1," disillusionment is spreading, the uk has for years had eurosceptic parties who want to go back to a trade bloc at most that do well in european elections, but the rise of alternative für deutschland even a book by a book by a former champion of european integration françois heisbourg suggests that the eu may need to put integration into reverse.",,,
1, eu legislation is perceived by many as an intrusion on national sovereignty and as an obstacle to democracy.,,,
1," some find it especially unwise to sacrifice their sovereignty for economic benefits, when they believe they end up losing both and having to bail out weaker economies.",,,
1, an alternative to the status quo is for the european union to limit itself to being merely a trade bloc where its member countries remove barriers to trade between each other (such as tariffs).,,,
1," this would maintain the key economic benefits of cooperation and make europe more competitive, without alienating its members.",,,
1," in essence, the alternative of a trade bloc would mean preserving the single market, where people, services, and goods can move freely, while repatriating other powers currently at eu level to national governments.",,,
1,"the single market has been highly beneficial to the eu, and it is mostly unquestioned that it should remain (3).",,,
1, but can the eu succeed as a trade bloc without integration in other areas?,,,
1, trade blocs exist worldwide that are reasonably successful without the involvement of a political union: nafta is one example.,,,
0," but are they really successful, and could the same policy apply to the eu?",,,
0,the eu is too large for a democratic structure .,,,
0," since it deals not with citizens directly but with member states , a question arises as to which agents should make fundamental decisions .",,,
0," should every member state get an equal vote , or a vote in proportion to the size of its population ?",,,
0," if nation states get equal votes , a lot of people in larger states such as germany , france or spain may find themselves highly disenfranchised .",,,
0," on the other hand , if states get votes in proportion to the size of its population , countries such as luxembourg will be forever hesitant to join , and rightly so , for its citizens would most likely be excluded .",,,
0, the democratic deficit in the eu is no less visible in practice .,,,
0," the commission is not directly elected  ; council politics are confusing , take a long time , and grind to a halt whenever germany is in the middle of elections  ; and the voting turnout for european elections , where meps are elected , is too low to be considered a fair representation of voters ' views  .",,,
0, this poses a problem the moment the eu begins having legislative power in its member states : we must not let more and more aspects of citizen 's lives be affected by an institution that is increasingly undemocratic .,,,
0, many of the policies of the political union intrude on national legislation .,,,
0," in many cases , eu policies go against national traditions or redefine laws that were already functional .",,,
0," occasionally eu policies even cause direct harm , when countries have less freedom to tailor them to their own conditions .",,,
0," during the past few years , the commission 's powers have included monitoring member states implementation of austerity policies in return for bailouts .",,,
0," however , everyone , including the imf , agrees that austerity was unsuccessful and has seriously hampered recovery  .",,,
0, being a part of a political union inevitably means that sacrifices have to be made and this often intrudes on national sovereignty by reducing he room for manoeuvre of national governments .,,,
0," intrusion by the eu would be justified if it creates substantially better laws or solid trade benefits ; however , regulations on the shape of cucumbers  do neither of these .",,,
0, the eu should not have legislative power on these areas .,,,
0, the european project has gone too far for many european countries .,,,
0, for some such as norway or switzerland the eu has already gone far past the amount of integration they would be willing to allow .,,,
0, even member states are increasingly finding that the eu 's intrusiveness and the cost of supporting smaller economies outweigh any potential benefit .,,,
0, britain has expressed this discontent particularly strongly .,,,
0,  this is a problem for the european union .,,,
0, the problem of its alienated member states is only likely to get worse as it seeks to continue expanding : new countries will have increasingly divergent values and will be harder to integrate while deepening will mean more countries are left behind .,,,
0," in practice , this means that the eu will face massive barriers to its goal of integration , and compromise all its other goals in the process .",,,
0, the best solution then is to go back to a stage in the eu 's development that every country supports ; the single market without the politics attached .,,,
0, this would bring the benefit of encouraging those who have been left out like norway and switzerland to join .,,,
0," the european area only consists of liberal democracies , which consistently honour their agreements .",,,
0," while historically a political union might have been necessary to further strengthen the coal and steel treaty , the eu as it originated , between recently belligerent states , these countries can now obtain the benefit of the trade union through multilateral agreements .",,,
0, they simply have to regulate protectionism and tariffs so countries can remain competitive and barriers to trade remain low .,,,
0," in the event that a country does not comply , the external pressure from the other countries , together with soft sanctions , is more than enough to keep the trade bloc functional .",,,
1,"june and julybrought a large number of revelations about the size of surveillance by the national security agency, the us intelligence agency that deals with monitoring communications around the world.",,,
1," while it was known that the internet was monitored it was not known to what extent, the leaks showed that such surveillance was indiscriminate essentially hovering in much of the internet for analysis, so much that the data is often held for only a few days.",,,
1, the revelations also applied to other countries agencies such as the uk’s government communications headquarters.,,,
1,on the 5th june a court order by the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court was published.,,,
1, this showed that verizon was being forced to hand over all telephony metadata to the national security agency.,,,
1," this included “session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, international mobile subscriber identity (imsi) number, international mobile station equipment identity (imei) number, etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers, and time and duration of call… [however] metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication”.",,,
1,this was however just the start.,,,
1, a program called prism was revealed the next day.,,,
1," the prism program allows collection of data on via a large number online services run by us companies including microsoft, google, yahoo, and facebook among others.",,,
1, the companies provide structured information that is easy for the nsa to search and analyse through the prism program.,,,
1,a couple of months later information of another program called xkeyscore were published in the guardian newspaper.,,,
1," xkeyscore is apparently the nsa’s widest reaching system that covers ""nearly everything a typical user does on the internet"", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.",,,
1," this is a data retrieval system that lets the nsa search other sources, particularly all the unstructured information they hoover up from tapping into the fiber optic cables that enter and leave the united states allowing access to almost all internet traffic.",,,
1,"the response to this spying has of course been outrage, but most of that outrage has been internal; that the spying is so indiscriminate it means that the national security agency is spying on americans and so breaching their fourth amendment rights.",,,
1, however no one is particularly bothered about whether the united states should be using these programs against other countries – the implicit assumption is yes it should.,,,
1,the united states clearly gets an immense amount of data out of its dragnets of information on the internet but what is more questionable is whether such programs are actually a benefit to the country.,,,
1, most nations manage with much smaller amounts of worldwide surveillance and there was outrage across many countries at the extent of the surveillance.,,,
1, the actions of the nsa have therefore both benefited the united states; they provide the benefit of being able to track almost anyone but the cost in terms of lost trust and damaged relations with the rest of the world.,,,
0, trust is important in international relations .,,,
0, whenever there is an international agreement each side has to trust that the other side will fulfil its side of the bargain ; there is no court to step in and ensure that they do .,,,
0, trust therefore needs to be built up .,,,
0, a large part of this is simply fulfilling promises that have been made in such treaties but trust can also be about being open with each other .,,,
0, when a country engages in an immense spying operation against another nation it is clearly damaging the trust between those nations .,,,
0," with the united states this is just one in a long line of issues that have undermined trust in the us government ; the iraq war , guantanamo bay , drone strikes etc. and the continued violations of international law these represent have all undermined trust in the united states internationally .",,,
0," every country needs friends and historically the united states has managed to maintain a large number of close relationships with states around the world ; it has alliances with various asian states such as south korea and japan , with many middle eastern states , and with almost the whole of europe .",,,
0, the nsa 's spying has damaged these relationships .,,,
0," french president hollande said `` we can not accept this kind of behavior from partners and allies , '' while the president of the european parliament , martin schulz complained `` the united states of america treats its closest partners , including germany for example , but also the european union as a whole like hostile powers '' .",,,
0," there have even been suggestions that this would jeopardise trade talks as warned by the commissioner viviane reding that `` if there is any doubt that our partners are bugging the offices of european negotiators , then the future trade talks could be in difficulty '' .",,,
0," the united states , along with europe , has been the key voice arguing for freedom on the internet and in particular that the internet should not be controlled nationally .",,,
0," russia and china in particular have been advocating for much more control over the internet by states with russia 's proposal advocating that `` member states shall have equal rights to manage the internet '' and `` member states shall have the sovereign right to establish and implement public policy ... on matters of internet governance , and to regulate the national internet segment '' .",,,
0, essentially every state should have the right to censor and surveil their chunk of the internet .,,,
0, with the united states already doing this countries that have previously been wavering may be much more inclined to support these proposals over us objections .,,,
0, the us would stand to lose out as it is currently the country with most control over internet governance .,,,
0," the united states is the preponderant power in internet commerce ; most of the big internet companies , the big software companies , even many of the hardware companies are companies that are based in the united states .",,,
0," this both enables us use of these systems for spying as occurred with prism because it happens that most web traffic passes through the united states , and makes the united states vulnerable when the world 's consumers think these companies have been betraying their trust .",,,
0, if consumers do n't think us companies can guarantee their data and privacy it should be no surprise that they will consider transferring their business .,,,
0," cloud computing is particularly affected , among the revelations has been that microsoft helps the nsa with access to its cloud storage service skydrive .",,,
0, according to a survey by the cloud security alliance% of non us responders had cancelled a project with us based providers since the leaks about nsa projects and% say they would be less likely to use a us based service .,,,

0," mubarak had managed to secure popularity within these groups by exploiting this fear that , should his regime be overthrown , extreme islamists such as the muslim brotherhood would take control and deprive them of their rights .",,,

1, there have even been suggestions from the defense service board that in the case of the biggest possible cyber-attacks the united states could not rule out a nuclear response.,,,
1,"as yet however there have been no cases of cyber warfare but there have been increasing problems with cyber-attacks in a peace time situation; companies such as the new york times and google have been hacked, a virus called stuxnet put back iran’s nuclear program, and most of estonia’s internet was reduced to a crawl inas a result of a distributed denial of service (ddos) attack.",,,
1, david rothkopf has suggested that cyber-attacks will result in a ‘cool war’ in which there is little military action but persistent tension as a result of minor actions such as cyber-attacks he says “the purpose of cool war is to be able to strike out constantly without triggering hot war while also making hot wars less desirable (much as did nuclear technology during cold war days) or even necessary.”,,,
1, if this becomes the case then the internet will surely be where this mostly happens.,,,

1,so what are cyber-attacks and the proposed targeted sanctions?,,,
1,"nato defines cyber attacks to be ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’ this is useful for defining what attacks might be just cause for a military response but this is a very high bar at the moment as few attacks cause immediate physical damage.",,,
1, sanctions could be used in response to much lower level attacks.,,,
1, businesses in particular would be keen to have the government help prevent the stealing of intellectual property through the imposition of sanctions.,,,
1, so we would simply be imposing sanctions when the economic losses are quantifiable and sufficient to be worth government effort to prevent.,,,
1,sanctions are the use of economic pressure by a state (or group) of states in an attempt to get another state to change a policy.,,,
1, the pressure is either through direct economic pain on the actor launching the attacks or to encourage public pressure.,,,
1, in this case sanctions would be either attempting to prevent a state from launching cyber attacks of its own or to persuade it to crack down on non-state actors that are launching these attacks.,,,
0, cyber-attacks pose a distinct problem for international diplomacy in that they are difficult to prevent and difficult to respond to .,,,
0," any kind of military response as the united states has threatened would be completely disproportionate against all but the very biggest of cyber-attacks , those that actually result in deaths , diplomacy on the other hand is as good as no response , if the response is simply a tongue lashing then the benefits of cyber espionage will be far higher than the cost .",,,
0," the only proportionate , and therefore just , response to a cyber-attack is sanctions .",,,
0, the sanctions can be used to impose a similar economic cost on the offending state as that caused by the cyber-attack .,,,
0, this would be just like the world trade organisation 's dispute settlement rules .,,,
0," they allow for the imposition of trade sanctions to a similar value to the losses being experienced as a result of protectionist action , with the sanctions sometimes on differing sectors to those where there are unfair trade practices .",,,
0," alternatively sanctions could mean a proportionate internet response ; users from the offending nation could be prohibited from using internet services , for example an attack by hackers on the us could result in people from that country being blocked from google and other us internet services .",,,
0, the big advantage of sanctions is that they can be as finely targeted as needed .,,,
0," if the sanctioning country only knows which country the cyber attack originated from then they can be broad brush sanctions , but if there is knowledge of which group initiated the attack then the sanctions can be more specific .",,,
0, for example in the case of unitof the chinese people 's liberation army that mandiant showed has been attacking us companies the united states could target sanctions at the people 's liberation army by tightening weapons bans .,,,
0, alternatively if the hackers are private then banning the import of certain computer equipment into that country would be appropriate .,,,
0," if individuals are known then the sanctions can be even more targeted , for example by freezing any bank accounts held outside their own country as the us did against north korea when it sanctioned banco delta asia through which north korea laundered money from criminal activities .",,,
0, at the moment the response to cyber-attacks has essentially been nothing .,,,
0, it is however clear that some response is needed as without a reaction there is no deterrence ; the attacks will keep coming until something is done .,,,
0, the number of cyber-attacks and the sensitivity of the information stolen have been increasing over recent years and as more and more work is done online and more and more systems are connected to the internet so cyber-attacks become more attractive .,,,
0, there needs to be a deterrent and the best deterrent is to make sure that such attacks are costly .,,,
0," as these attacks are usually cross border , and in this debate we are only concerned with cross border attacks , then the only way to create a cost is through sanctions .",,,
0, these sanctions can either hit the assailant directly or else hit his government so encouraging them to crack down on hacking emanating from their country .,,,
0, it should be remembered that china argues that it does not launch cyber-attacks meaning that any such attacks from china must duly be private .,,,
0, if this is the case then sanctions are the best way of prompting internal law enforcement .,,,
0, sanctions therefore encourage all nations where there are cyber criminals to make sure they take such cyber-crime seriously .,,,
0, if they do not get their own cyber criminals under control then they may be affected by sanctions .,,,
0, cyber conflict favours the offence ; when the defender is successful they gain nothing and impose no harm on the attacker who is free to try again elsewhere .,,,
0, the attackers are free to attack until they get past the defences somewhere .,,,
0, that the attacks do n't risk lives helps to encourage an offensive mindset as makes it seem like there is no downside to attempting to dominate your opponent .,,,
0, this means the only cyber response is to attack the attacker so that the same advantages apply .,,,
0, the result is that cyber-attacks have a very real danger of long term tension or escalation .,,,
0," if one side is losing a conflict where both sides are attempting to steal the other 's intellectual property , or the other has little to steal , the response may be something like the stuxnet attack that involves physical damage , this then would probably be considered an illegal use of force creating a thin line between a cyber-war and a real war .",,,
0, when the cyber war involves physical damage as the us has warned there then may be a military response .,,,
0, sanctions are a way to apply pressure without this risk of escalation into a military conflict .,,,

0, interdicting chemical weapons during transport and bombing the storage facilities to make it much more difficult to move the weapons would be easiest to accomplish .,,,
0, but if chemical weapons are about to be used then attacking the delivery vehicles would be necessary ; any intervention would have overwhelming air superiority so would prevent the option of aircraft and helicopters being used to deliver the weapons .,,,

1,"self-determination is loosely defined as the right of nations or peoples to ""freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development""1.",,,
1," it is common to hear the assertion that this is a ""fundamental human right"".",,,
1," but what exactly does this mean, and is it correct?",,,
1,self-determination is an issue in many different contexts around the world.,,,
1," many of these involve states which have, through territorial expansion, population shifts, boundary changes, independence from or colonisation of other nations, found themselves in charge of minority groups who may have strong ethnic, national, religious, cultural or linguistic differences from other inhabitants of a nation.",,,
1," this can lead to all sorts of problems; minorities may identify more strongly with a neighbouring state, or fear that their cultural and political identity is being diluted by state policies, while nation states are often concerned about instability or loss of their strong national identity if minority groups are given too much autonomy or special treatment.",,,
0,"so, on balance, is self-determination a universal right that should be available to all peoples, or is it an idea whose time has passed?",,,
0,many states in the modern world do not respect the rights of minorities or actively seek to dilute and subsume them into the majority culture .,,,
0, others offer limited protections to minority peoples but stop short of allowing them to choose their own futures .,,,
0, we need to reassert their right to self-determination to ensure that these minority cultures are not lost .,,,
0, failure to defend the principle of self-determination now will effectively close off the choices of future generations .,,,
0," for example , australian government policy for many decades was to ignore aboriginal rights , denying them full citizenship1 and removing children from their homes and relocating them with white families , the so-called `` stolen generation ``.",,,
0, as a result many indigenous australians no longer have a strong link to their native cultures and languages .,,,
0," the same is arguably true in places like tibet , where traditional culture is being diluted over time through the deliberate policy of the chinese government .",,,
0," in some contexts , separation may not be a realistic option for minority peoples .",,,
0," however , that does not mean that self-determination is not meaningful for such groups .",,,
0," for indigenous peoples , self-determination may take the form of restitution for land that was stolen from them , or compensation and reparations .",,,
0," furthermore , self-determination may take the form of political autonomy , or greater rights to decide how children are educated , or parallel systems of justice such as sharia courts .",,,
0, self-determination is about representation and identity and choice - not about outcomes .,,,
0, many modern nation states are the product of historical accident or hurried decolonisation processes that did not properly take account of ethnic or religious differences between peoples in the states that resulted .,,,

0,"  the 250,000 israelis who lived in the southern part of the country were under constant threat , often in bomb shelters , and the economy suffered as a result .",,,
0,  israel went to great lengths to avoid its military escalation .,,,
0," just a few days before israel 's military operations , outgoing israeli prime minister ehud olmert made an appeal on the arab television station al-arabiya asking gaza residents to stop the firing of rockets and mortar shells so that a military response could be avoided .",,,
0,"  this appeal was apparently ignored by hamas and the other militant groups in gaza , and so israel proceeded to respond militarily to remove the capacity of gaza to launch rocket and mortar attacks -- israel was left with no other way to ensure that the inhabitants of the country 's southern regions would not have to live in fear of rocket fire .",,,
0," gaza was also a test case , intended to prove that israel remained a legitimate and authoritative actor in the region .",,,
0, much more was at stake than merely the military outcome of israel 's operation .,,,
0," the issue , rather , was israel 's ability to restore its deterrence power and uphold the principle that its citizens can not be targeted with impunity .",,,
0,  israel 's military operations were a good tool to fulfill this need for self-defense and did so effectively .,,,
0," the israeli strikes hit their targets precisely enough to do significant damage to hamas forces , both to its leadership and to the tunnels from gaza to egypt that hamas uses to smuggle in weapons and build its growing army .",,,
0,  doing this damage was necessary as israel could never be safe with a strong terrorist regime in control of gaza .,,,
0," as david harris , executive director for the american jewish committee , argued : `` israel could not tolerate a terrorist regime on its border that was launching repeated rocket and mortar attacks against israeli towns and villages . ''",,,
0,  therefore there can be no debate that israel had the right to defend itself as well as the right to determine how best to do so .,,,
0," while it is easy for countries and foreigners to state their opinions about israel 's security interests and how its actions may or may not fulfill them , israel 's right to make that judgment itself must be respected .",,,
0, therefore israel 's military operations against gaza were justified as legitimate self defense against hamas and militant aggression which was putting the lives of israeli citizens in jeopardy .,,,
0," as michael oren and yossi klein haleviargue explain , `` the israeli public will not make territorial concessions on the west bank or the golan heights if gaza is allowed to become a neighboring terrorist state that can launch attacks with impunity .",,,
0, israel had already had a bad enough experience letting that happen with hezbollah in southern lebanon . '',,,
0,"  without the assurance that they will be allowed to protect their homes and families following withdrawal , israelis will rightly perceive a two-state solution as an existential threat .",,,
0," they will continue to share the left-wing vision of coexistence with a peaceful palestinian neighbor in theory , but in reality will heed the right 's warnings of jewish powerlessness .",,,
0,"  meanwhile , the stronger hamas becomes , the more resistance moderate palestinian president mahmoud abbas will face to making any concessions to israel .",,,
0,"  therefore damaging hamas , via operation cast lead , actually aided the peace process in the long run , and was necessary in order to make an eventual two-state peace solution possible .",,,
0, the israeli attacks may also eventually help force hamas to accept a more durable ceasefire .,,,
0," unlike the botched invasion of lebanon in, when israel set itself the unattainable goal of eliminating the military capability of hezbollah , during operation cast lead it was made clear that the objective was not to wipe out hamas , but instead to force the radical group to accept a durable cease-fire on israel 's terms .",,,
0,"  this was necessary as prior to operation cast lead hamas showed no interest in peace , opting instead to pursue its political objectives through the use of terrorism .",,,
0," when hamas came to power in gaza in january, it failed to control the rocket fire from the variety of miltary brigades , including its own al-qassam brigade , into israel and failed to establish internal stability .",,,
0," the widespread violence between fatah and hamas , which ended in june, when hamas took control of gaza and ousted leaders of president mahmoud abbas 's fatah movement , made israel more wary of the security threat an unstable gaza could pose .",,,
0,"  in israel 's view , hamas ' behavior and its reliance on terror tactics will never change if it thinks it can attack with impunity , and so the israeli military operations were necessary and justified in the name of restoring israel 's deterrent and weakening hamas , both of which make long term peace more likely .",,,
0, operation cast lead was justified as it was proportionate to hamas ' rocket attacks against israel .,,,
0," it should be remembered that 250,000 israelis living in the southern part of the country had lived under years of terrorism before operation cast lead was launched , often in bomb shelters , and the economy has suffered .",,,
0," the world 's media may only have paid attention when israel responded to hamas ' barrage , but this does not mean that israel was not already under severe attack by this point .",,,
0,"  moreover , the israeli strikes were rightly measured to disable hamas rocket attacks .",,,
0,  terror groups fire indiscriminately at innocent israelis and then complain of excessive or disproportionate force when israel fires back .,,,
0," but according to internationally accepted laws of war , israel is permitted to respond with the force necessary to end the conflict .",,,
0,"  israel was legitimate in using full force to win its war on hamas ; israel was under no obligation to restrain itself in what is , on hamas ' own terms , an existential war .",,,
0," provoked by hamas , israel had every right to wage a disproportionate and overwhelming response .",,,
0, hamas has repeatedly stated that its objective is to destroy israel .,,,
0," such an existential threat goes beyond simply hamas ' rocket attacks , as it portends much more destructive attacks in the future .",,,
0," this justifies defensive attacks from israel that go beyond responding merely to the hamas rockets , and would even justify israeli efforts to fully demobilize or destroy hamas .",,,
0,"  in spite of this , israel was actually far more restrained and proportionate than it was obligated to be .",,,
0," israeli precision strikes sought to minimize civilian deaths , as benjamin netanyahu argued : `` in launching precision strikes against hamas rocket launchers , headquarters , weapons depots , smuggling tunnels and training camps , israel is trying to minimize civilian casualties . ''",,,
0,"  unlike hamas , israeli strikes targeted military sites , not civilians .",,,
0," as gary grant argued : `` even if you target your action at military sites , civilians are inevitably going to get killed ... these need to be contrasted with the actions of hamas where every single rocket is designed to attack civilian populations , so every single act of hamas in firing these rockets is clearly an illegal act without any legal justification . ''",,,
0,"  israel may have been justified in acting disproportionately , but instead chose to respond in a proportionate and limited manner which minimized civilian deaths in gaza , and thus the israeli military operations were certainly justified .",,,

1,this is focused around whether or not this assistance has been more of a help or a hindrance for africa in the face of the continent’s major challenges.,,,

0, the experience that these forces provide is visibly valuable for africa 's counter-terrorism activities .,,,
0, africa is the least developed continent in the world and will struggle to independently maintain a specialised counter-terrorism force .,,,
0, thirty four of its fifty four states are classed as ` least developed countries ' .,,,
0, the result of poor funding and bad governance is a decreased efficiency of security and military services in these states .,,,
0," in turn , this has resulted in destabilisation of the region .",,,
0," wages , training , and military equipment are expenses which few african countries can afford alone .",,,
0," kenya , for example , had to disband its police reserve unit inas unpaid officers had turned to corruption to ensure a decent wage , despite the need to combat terrorism in the state as shown by the attack on nairobi 's westgate shopping mall .",,,
0, aid from the united states enables these african states to field financially viable forces which can then participate in counter-terrorism .,,,
0," before military aid was cut to egypt in, the us provided $ 1.3 billion annually to support one of the strongest militaries on the continent .",,,
0, the united states is the only significant actor in region which can be relied upon in counter-terrorism issues .,,,
0," due to the `` war on terror '' and a need to maintain a military equipment export industry , the us has been a reliable ally for many african states .",,,
0, the alternatives are less attractive .,,,
0," african nations often dislike their neighbours involving themselves in their affairs , exemplified by the second conflict in the democratic republic of congo -- the great war of africa that drew in nations across the region attempting to secure their own interests .",,,
0, the limited effectiveness of the au 's army has also prevented them from becoming a prominent actor in counter-terrorism .,,,
0, the failure of the au 's measures in sudan duringforced them to appeal to the un for aid .,,,
0," this was effectively an admission of failure , signifying these actors as weak in comparison to the usa .",,,
0, the presence of us military equipment and counter-terrorism forces in africa will result in greater security for the rest of the world .,,,
0, many of the terrorist groups which have existed in the ` ungoverned ' spaces of africa have an international agenda .,,,
0," al-qaeda and other groups have used africa as a base to plan attacks against the west , such as themadrid bombing .",,,

0," everyone should have equal rights ; hilary clinton stated that ` gay rights are human rights ' , the derogation of such rights is a serious moral affront .",,,
0, there is evidence that homosexuality is not optional .,,,
0, discriminating on sexual orientation is therefore the same as discriminating upon factors such as race and ethnicity .,,,
0, even if changeable it would be the same as discrimination on the basis of identity or religion .,,,
0, same sex relations are victimless which calls in to question whether it could ever be defined as something to be criminalised .,,,

0," in the u.s. where homosexuality is legal , only% of rape victims were male and only a small proportion of those being male on male .",,,
0, criminalising and institutionally embedding hatred against homosexuality has served to alienate many africans from their families and communities .,,,
0, discrimination on the basis of homosexuality is not something any donor would want to endorse even implicitly it is therefore morally right to cut the aid .,,,
0, if the west did decide to reduce aid to african states it could pressure african states to change their policies on homosexuality .,,,
0, africa is renowned for the dependency on aid .,,,
0," analysts claim that this dependency negates the need for african economies to reform , relying instead on foreign governments and ngos .",,,
0, this reliance on aid could be exploited to alter policy within those african countries that are unable to act economically independently .,,,
0, this policy has been successful in the past .,,,
0, when britain cut # 19m to malawi infor arresting two men for marrying ; there was a reversal of government policy in the african state and all anti-homosexual laws were suspended .,,,
0, the equality created by this policy change would allow greater access to retroviral drugs and other hiv/aids treatment for the gay community .,,,
0," laws outlawing homosexuality , and the stigma of the false connection between hiv and homosexuality , have decreased the accessibility of the gay community to treatment .",,,

0, an african state with veto power in the unsc would have much more leverage to get african positions listened to .,,,
0, this is something that is particularly important as africa is the region that is most commonly on the un agenda .,,,
0, an african permanent member would likely alter the priorities of the council for the better .,,,
0," it would be the first unsc member without nuclear weapons , indeed if it were south africa it would be a state that had given up nuclear weapons so would be in favour of disarmament .",,,
0, there might be more attempts to solve the ` root causes ' of conflicts rather than just providing a response when a conflict breaks out as rwanda promoted as president of the unsc in.,,,
0," an african member might also be more interested in development issues , pushing on climate change etc, it would provide more of a view from the south .",,,

0, at the moment african countries are `` preached to rather than consulted as equals '' this must change .,,,

1,"imperialism casts a long shadow over africa, and much of that shadow is a result of the way the imperial powers drew their borders.",,,
1," lord salisbury famously put it ""we have been engaged in drawing lines upon maps where no white man’s feet have ever trod; we have been giving away mountains and rivers and lakes to each other, only hindered by the small impediment that we never knew exactly where the mountains and rivers and lakes were.""",,,
1, but when the borders had been drawn and agreed they were set; administrators who suggested they should be tweaked to reflect ethnic groupings were rebuffed.,,,
1,colonial powers could live with artificial borders; they were not too concerned with the comings and goings of the natives and could make sure that no conflict would break out over odd borders that frankly they did not care about.,,,
1, with decolonisation however artificial borders became much more of an issue.,,,
1, london or paris might not have been concerned about african borders but yaoundé and rabat were much more likely to be.,,,
1, borders were not only much closer and have a greater impact on policy but ensuring sovereignty right up to the border was a way of creating a nation state.,,,
1, thus the new leaders were no more inclined to rethink borders than the old.,,,
1," the organisation of african unity (oau) charter highlights a determination “to safeguard… sovereignty and territorial integrity” in the preamble, the purposes, and the principles of the oau.",,,
1," as a result this issue is still an immense problem; the border between togo and ghana alone divides the dagomba, akposso, konkomba and ewe peoples.",,,
1,ratner suggests that new states should only preserve the status quo on borders until the states can resolve the competing claims so colonial era borders should not be taken as immutable.,,,
1, the assumption then is that there will be changes to the administrative legacy at some point.,,,
1, but this does not address borders that are already half a century old.,,,
1, redefining african borders would seem to imply just redrawing existing borders but in practice doing so while not allowing an opportunity for the creation of new states would be difficult.,,,
1, the proposal therefore would be that current borders are not set; there should be commissions that find the ethnic borders between states and those ethnicities should be able to decide which state they join.,,,
1, where there are strong independence movements this would also be a chance to create new states but the default assumption should be that ethnic groups want to remain in their current state unless this is clearly disputed so as to not mean a chaotic breakup of africa as we know it.,,,
0, imperialism and colonisation is one of the great wrongs of history where much of the globe was carved up without any reference to the facts on the ground .,,,
0," when the west drew borders peoples were split , and kingdoms and cultures carved up .",,,
0, independence may have ended some of the worst aspects of imperialism but it exacerbated the problem of borders .,,,
0, africa has since seen the problems that this has created and should realise the need to break from the colonial legacy .,,,
0, in africa borders are artificial often running through ethnic groupings without consideration for culture or even local geography with the exception of water courses .,,,
0, altering these borders to reflect ethnicities and culture would help states to create their own national identity as their identities would not be split .,,,
0, having the whole of an ethnicity within one state will help prevent misappropriation of culture and history by another state .,,,
0, redrawing borders could help resolve conflict in africa .,,,
0," michalopoulos and papaioannou find `` civil conflict intensity , as reflected in war casualties and duration , is approximately% higher in areas where partitioned ethnicities reside . ''",,,
0, conflict duration is 18.5 % higher .,,,
0," they identify seven different ways in which artificial borders lead to , or intensify conflict ; 1 , partitioning ethnicities creates irredentist demands 2 , partitioning makes an independence movement more likely 3 , when borders are not marked the ethnic group has a reason to attempt to change the border 4 , patronage politics leads to discrimination against minorities 5 , splitting ethnicities encourages smuggling and criminalisation 6 , splitting resources that were previously part of an ethnic group 's homeland will leave the ethnic group trying to engineer the resources return 7 , partitioning reduces development so increases inequality with and resentment towards the center of the state .",,,
0, getting rid of all of these reasons for conflict would help make africa more peaceful in the long run .,,,
0, using data from satellites measuring luminosity michalopoulos and papaioannou find that border areas with partitioned ethnic groups are up to% less developed than those towards the centre of countries so are not artificially split .,,,
0, ethnicity is significant for trade .,,,
0, for example between niger and nigeria prices of millet increase at the border by 23.2 % when it is also the border between ethnicities but only 9.3 % when the same ethnicity is on both sides of the border for cowpea the figures are 20.2 % and 14.4 % .,,,
0, moreover internally where there is an ethnic border between markets there is a similar increase of% for millet and% for cowpea .,,,
0, ethnicity may also affect the ability to gain credit from other traders .,,,
0, it therefore makes sense economically to have borders at ethnic boundaries due to the natural trading relations within an ethnic group .,,,
0, splitting an ethnic group creates unnecessary hardship by making it more difficult to trade .,,,
0, a redrawing of borders would allow for democratic participation in the building of new african states .,,,
0, there would have to be plebiscites in local areas to determine where borders should run and extensive consultation so that the borders are drawn based on the wishes of the people this time .,,,
0, the opposite of what happens at the moment .,,,
0, for example much of the bakassi homeland was ceded by nigeria to cameroon as a result of an international court of justice ruling on the colonial border and many people are asking nigeria to resettle them as they do n't share cameroon 's culture .,,,
0, clearly the people would surely much prefer to have their destiny in their own hands than letting the borders be settled by an international court pouring over 19th century maps .,,,
1,africa is known as a continent in conflict; it is sometimes called ‘the dark continent’.,,,
1, the creation of an african union standing army would be one way of attempting to create peace on the continent.,,,
1," a standing army is a permanent, often professional, army.",,,
1,  setting up such a permanent force for the au would be the first permanent force for an international organisation that is not made up of forces seconded from national armies.,,,
1," the au constitutive act does not authorise such a creation but does have objectives of achieving “greater unity and solidarity”, accelerating political integration, promoting peace, and a principle to “establishment of a common defence policy for the african continent”.",,,
1, however as with any international organisation a core principle is “sovereign equality” and “non-interference” this force is primarily going to be about peacekeeping and peace-making.,,,
1," this will be in response to the use of “the right of member states to request intervention from the union in order to restore peace and security” but the union could also “intervene in a member state pursuant to a decision of the assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity”.",,,
1,the african union has been active in peacekeeping.,,,
1, since the end ofthe au’s peace and security council has had responsibility for maintaining peace in africa.,,,
1, it is the body that decides on interventions by the au.,,,
1," since then the au has been most notably involved in the conflict in somalia but has also been in sudan, burundi and the central african republic.",,,
1, also inthe au decided to create the african standby force.,,,
1, this consists of five regional brigades of slightly overtroops which should be available for rapid deployment anywhere in africa.,,,
1, these however are multinational brigades that remain in their home countries armed forces rather than a permanent au force.,,,
1, it has regularly been delayed so it might seem odd to propose something more ambitious.,,,
1, an au army would however avoid some of the problems associated with this force of coordinating from numerous different forces and ensuring they all remain up to standard by centralising.,,,

0, the main threat to this unity as well as peace in the continent is rebel groups and internal conflict .,,,
0, groups for whom the only goal is wealth or to get into power in their own country .,,,
0,  an au force 's role would therefore be to defeat these armed groups and to engage in peacekeeping .,,,
0, an au force is always going to be better at handling these situations due to its legitimacy in africa .,,,
0," in many african countries , the west is perceived as an imperialist power , due to their colonial past and as a result there is a serious lack of trust between the parties .",,,
0," an au force will also be better than any local force as a peacekeeper as it will , like the un , be seen as being independent while also being african .",,,
0," it would also , like the rebels , be able to cross borders .",,,
0," such a force would therefore be able to hunt down rebels like the lords resistance army which has so far evaded destruction by moving between uganda , southern sudan , and dr congo .",,,
0, countries desire to have influence among the international community .,,,
0," states gain this influence in all sorts of way ; economic wealth , high technology , charismatic leaders , or a military power .",,,
0, having an au standing army would help provide africa with influence ; it would show the unity of the continent and its willingness to work together .,,,
0, a lot of influence is about perception and this is something that an au army can change ; africa will no longer be a continent that can not act for itself even on its own soil but will instead be taking the burden off more established peacekeeping countries .,,,
0, this is an important gain as influence is gained by being able to bring something to the table .,,,
0, having an au force means the au will always be able to bring resources and capabilities when there is a crisis in africa .,,,
0," the default position will no longer be to look to the un , or even to france and the uk for peacekeepers when there is a crisis in africa but to the au itself .",,,
0, but an au army would have other benefits too as the continent would be a better investment opportunity if there is an army guaranteeing security and ensuring peace .,,,

1,there are two main aspects to the question of tibet’s future.,,,
1, first there are questions of how china has governed tibet.,,,
1," has china failed to govern tibet in an appropriate manner, or has it done a pretty good job?",,,
1, has it violated human rights in tibet?,,,
1, was its exiling of the dalai lama inappropriate?,,,
1, is it illegitimate for china to govern tibet while depriving it of its spiritual and historical leader?,,,
1, does this constitute a suppression of its religious freedoms?,,,
1, how bad are china's human rights violations in tibet relative to human rights violations elsewhere in the world where separatist movements exist?,,,
1, is it really all that bad or are we just being hyper-sensitive to tibet due to the public exposure of the dalai lama and the tibetan case?,,,
1," has china stonewalled tibet on negotiations, or has it been politically reconciliatory?",,,
1, has china economically exploited tibet or helped invest in and modernize it economy?,,,
1," conversely, have tibetans followed ethical and human rights norms in tibet, or have they engaged in the same kind of abuses as the chinese government?",,,
1, have tibetans killed and/or abused chinese settlers in tibet?,,,
1," have tibetan protests been peaceful and respectful, or have they been unethical and/or violent?",,,
1," has the behavior of tibetan exiles been appropriate, or have they been violent and revolutionary?",,,
1, should a tibetan right to self-determination survive any alleged tibetan human rights abuses?,,,
1, does tibet have a history of human right abuses?,,,
1, what effect does this have on tibet's bid for independence?,,,
1,secondly there are the more moral questions of legitimacy.,,,
1," namely, whether the chinese seizure of tibet was legitimate, and whether that should have any bearing on the present.",,,
1,finally there are the questions of whether tibet would be a viable independent state.,,,
1, would it be able to resist chinese influence?,,,
1, would it only be able to do so with excessive western aid?,,,
1, would the latter justify chinese fears about dismemberment?,,,

0, tibet has a long history of independence going back more thanyears .,,,
0," even in times of chinese `` domination '' , tibetans largely governed themselves independently of the small number of chinese officials in lhasa .",,,

0," tibet 's annexation by china occurred under the guns of 40,000 chinese soldiers , and the precedent begun by the invasion stands as one of the few post-1945 cases in which the national principle was abandoned and the only one in which a fully independent state vanished from the map .",,,

0," demographically tibetans are rapidly becoming a minority within their own country , and administratively this has already taken place .",,,

0," while there may well have been past periods of chinese sovereignty , the policies of the current beijing government seem designed to produce an outcome far more permanent than those past efforts which respected tibetan identity and culture .",,,

0," given the rising economic and military clout of both powers , a future conflict is becoming ever more likely , and they already fought one war against one another in.",,,
0," an independent tibet would mean that the two nations would no longer have a common border , making their rivalry less practical and far less pressing .",,,
0," this would reduce military obligations for both , and prevent the tibetans from being caught in the middle of a future conflict .",,,
0," tibet , and the resistance tibetans continue to show to chinese rule presents a toxic domestic and international political problem that costs far more than it worth .",,,
0," domestically , violence in tibet is the most serious domestic disturbance facing the chinese government , and the fact that there is nearly constant violence between han settlers and tibetans forces the chinese to alienate everyone in order to contain it .",,,
0," furthermore , the economic and political disenfranchisement of the tibetan people is an enormous domestic problem , as it has led to large numbers becoming unemployed and moving to other parts of china where they form an underclass .",,,
0," internationally , the tibetan issue keeps china 's human rights record in the news and almost torpedoed theolympic games .",,,
0," given that china is already losing money on the province , it may well be worth it for china to jettison it in order to gain much greater international benefits .",,,
1,"one of the great successes of the united nations has been the acceptance that interstate war is wrong, the acceptance that “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.",,,
1," there is some debate about whether this has actually meant that there that there is actually less war, or indeed whether it will actually stop another world war from happening, but one thing it has done is make almost everyone recognise that waging war should be considered to be illegal.",,,
1, now it is generally assumed that initiating a military action against another state can only be legal if there is backing from the united nations security council.,,,
1,yet there have been attempts to chip away at this concept.,,,
1, innato intervened in kosovo without the authorisation of the security council because russia would not countenance intervention against its ally serbia.,,,
1, the united states did not advance solid legal claims that it was legally entitled to engage in a conflict against serbia as a result of the ethnic cleansing occurring in kosovo.,,,
1, nato did not see unsc authorisation or justify on the basis of self defense it simply ignored the international norm against intervention.,,,
1, in doing so it may have changed that norm.,,,
1,the us and coalition of the willing’s invasion of iraq was another breach of this norm against interstate war that is not authorised by the security council or in self defense.,,,
1," there was more adherence to norms against the use of military force than in the kosovo campaign; there were attempts to claim self defense, and george w. bush and tony blair went to the security council to try and gain assent to go to war.",,,
1," when this failed they attempted to claim that a previous resolution, 1441, was sufficient authorisation to use force.",,,
1," it is however generally accepted, except by the governments involved, that resolutiondid not by itself authorise force.",,,
1,since these interventions the concept that there may be a humanitarian reason to intervene has become more accepted.,,,
1," the united nations has not gone for a full doctrine of humanitarian intervention but indid agree to a ‘responsibility to protect’ in which states accepted responsibility to protect against genocide and other crimes against humanity but the acceptance was simply to act, not explicitly an acceptance of the use of force.",,,
1," this was used as justification in a nato action to protect benghazi in 2012, but this air assault, unlike kosovo or iraq, had un security council authorisation as russia and china abstained.",,,
1,although russia and china abstained in the case of libya on other issues where the united states might want to take action they have not been so obliging.,,,
1," any attempt to attack iran, or syria, or north korea, or practically anywhere for any reason is liable to be blocked.",,,
1," the result from the point of view of the americans is that the security council is broken and as such they may need to go it alone, or in a coalition with other like-minded states.",,,
1, if it is action to prevent atrocities should it be considered legal if the intervening power can’t get authorization from its peers?,,,
0, when a massacre is about to happen it is legal to intervene to prevent that massacre .,,,
0, the ` responsibility to protect ' which was accepted by the un in.,,,
0," resolution 60/1 at theworld summit stated , there was international responsibility `` to help to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .",,,
0," in this context , we are prepared to take collective action in a timely and decisive manner . ''",,,
0, though this will only happen `` should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations '' .,,,
0, this is most certainly the case in syria where the national authorities are the ones doing much of the killing .,,,
0, it must be proved that the syrian regime is responsible for the attacks ; the us and uk say there is such evidence but so far the link is not crystal clear .,,,
0," even the uk government accepts that there must be `` convincing evidence , generally accepted by the international community as a whole , of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale , requiring immediate and urgent relief '' .",,,
0, as the doctrine states peaceful means must have been tried -- and in syria after two years of conflict we can safely say a peaceful resolution is not in sight .,,,
0, and the use of force must be proportionate -- which since there is no plan for a full scale invasion in syria it will be .,,,
0, a second possible justification for intervention is when the state that is intervening against is itself breaking international law such as the chemical weapons convention or the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .,,,
0, the intervention would then be to force compliance of the treaty ; this would mean forcible disarmament of illegal weapons .,,,
0, in the case of syria the country could be deemed to have violated its own legal obligations due to its having broken thegeneva protocol that bans the use of chemical weapons .,,,
0, since manufacturing and possession of these weapons is banned if it is considered that having such weapons is a ` gross violation of international law ' then a limited use of force to destroy these weapons could be considered to be legal .,,,
0," this could be considered to be analogous to the police stepping in to confiscate a banned weapon , with no police internationally other states have to be the ones to step in .",,,
0, the international prohibition on the use of force has always been honoured in large part in the breach leading to the question of whether it should really be considered to be binding international law at all .,,,
0," almost every major country has launched an illegal offensive action at some point ; the usa has been involved in kosovo and iraq , the uk and france in attacking egypt in, china in attacking vietnam in, and russia , as the ussr , in attacking afghanistan also in.",,,
0, in each instance of unilateral offensive action there will be justifications and a ` smoke screen ' to make the conflict appear to be legal when in fact it is not .,,,
0, major powers should simply admit that they do not regard the prohibition of the use of force as binding on them .,,,
0," even without admitting it because international law is based upon state behaviour the use of force is legal as michael j glennon suggests `` the consent of united nations member states to the general prohibition against the use of force , as expressed in the charter , has in this way been supplanted by a changed intent as expressed in deeds . ''",,,
1,"definitions vary, but a failed state is usually thought of as one where any government has broken down to the point where it can no longer provide certain essential services to the people.",,,
1," most importantly, this often means that law and order has collapsed, with the government losing its monopoly over the legitimate use of force.",,,
1," in such cases, large areas of the country are in the control of non-government forces, perhaps through civil war but often as a result of lawlessness and banditry.",,,
1," recent estimates by foreign policy and the fund for peace (see further reading) suggest that up tobillion people worldwide live in insecure states where the government has either failed or is fragile, and are exposed to varying degrees of violence as a result.",,,
1,"the most complete example of a failed state is perhaps somalia, where no government has been able to take effective control of the country since the death of its dictator siad barre.",,,
1," haiti, the democratic republic of congo and cote d'ivoire provide other commonly-discussed examples.",,,
1," states recovering from recent collapse could include liberia, sierra leone and angola, although in none of these is recovery certain, while cambodia, mozambique, lebanon and east timor provide examples of relative longer-term success after periods of failure.",,,

1,"proponents of preventative intervention argue it is necessary to prevent the suffering of civilians innocent of the decisions taken on the route to failure, and that allowing failure would risk regional instability.",,,
1," opponents maintain, in contrast, that the cost of intervention is too high and that to provide a safety net to failing states would only encourage other struggling states to take risks.",,,
0,"  states should act to help the people of a failing state , as once it collapses no government services will be provided , including law and order .",,,
0," states should work with the un in leading attempts at conflict resolution , and should engage in subsequent peacekeeping missions and investment in nation-building initiatives , e.g. funding and organising the reintegration of non-combatants into society , organising elections , building up civil society , creating effective government institutions , etc. .",,,
0, the failure of the un operation in somalia inis telling ; the country has not had a functioning central government ever since .,,,
0, intervention to prevent such outcomes will require both greater willingness to commit funds on the part of the powerful states and a commitment to conflict resolution which has been largely lacking in recent national policy world-wide .,,,
0, it is in the interests of international stability that failing states are rescued before it is too late .,,,
0," failed states often infect a whole region , as the collapse of liberia did in west africa - a problem known as contagion .",,,
0," neighbouring states back different factions with arms and squabble over resources , such as the diamonds of sierra leone and the mineral wealth of congo .",,,
0, internally neighbours are destabilised by floods of refugees and weapons from next door .,,,
0, their own rebel groups can also easily find shelter to regroup and mount fresh attacks in the lawless country just over their borders .,,,
0," former u.n. secretary boutros-ghali claimed , as his justification for support for failing states , that the u.n. has a responsibility under its charter to ` maintain international peace and security ' amid fears ` the demise of a state is often marked by violence and widespread human rights violations that affect other states ' .",,,
0," intervention prevents this by entailing the establishment of conditions for reconstruction which thereafter provides physical infrastructure , facilities and social services .",,,
0, the ultimate goal therefore of the intervention is to ensure that both the state concerned and the region as a whole require no further military or monetary support .,,,
0," failed states also export dangers more widely , as they often provide an opportunity for drug crops such as opium , afghanistan , or coca , parts of colombia , to be grown , processed and traded without fear of authority , with devastating effects both locally and globally .",,,
0," desperate people may also take refuge in religious or political extremism , which may in time come to threaten the rest of the world .",,,
0," in so doing , failed states often become havens for terrorists , who can find safety in them to plot against the west , to establish training camps for future terrorists , and to build up finance , weapons and other resources with which to mount campaigns .",,,
0," in what was a key claim that later underpinned theus national security strategy and the u.s. war on terror , stephen walt , a professor of international relations at harvard university , has described failed states as ` breeding grounds of instability , mass migration , and murder ' .",,,
0," this can be seen in somalia , where states in recent years have ` begun to fear al qaeda will take advantage of the lawlessness ' .",,,
0," other fragile states , such as niger , congo and sierra leone have radioactive and other valuable minerals which could be very dangerous in the hands of determined terrorists .",,,
0, the usa should work with the un to strengthen governments so that they can more effectively maintain internal order while controlling their borders and tracking resource-flows .,,,
0," the united nations , and its resident body , the security council , has both the right and the capability to intervene in countries in order to maintain the peace .",,,
0," peace in this sense represents more than the absence of bloodshed , but also provides the means by which aid organizations can enter a territory and provide the requisite resources to prevent civilian suffering .",,,
0," the united nations have proven their efficacy in this area , mandating an intervention in the ivory coast inthat sought to prevent the exacerbation of tensions between the government and rebel forces .",,,

1,the first thing to note here is that we are not considering a broad brush treaty on internet governance that covers all sorts of questions such as who creates domain names as such an agreement would be very difficult to hammer out as shown by the failure at the international telecommunications union in 2012.,,,
1, instead this would be a treaty purely between governments and limited to cybersecurity; as it is a national security issue it is clearly a governmental issue.,,,
1,what are cyber-attacks?,,,
1, this could potentially mean the use of cyberspace in war but that is not what we are going to debate; the chances of states adhering to such an international treaty in a war situation would seem to be slim and it would be of little use the rest of the time.,,,
1, instead we are talking about the multitude of attacks that are launched every day.,,,
1, the ban would most clearly apply to state actors but for convenience sake it might be best to consider it outlawing all cyber attacks and placing the burden on each state to tackle it as a domestic law enforcement issue.,,,
1,andrea renda of the centre for european policy studies suggests:this would simply mean putting these into treaty form.,,,
1, note this debate directly follows on from a previous debatabase debate on whether sanctions could be used as a response to cyber-attacks and covers many of the same issues.,,,
0," conflict needs to be regulated , and something that can start conflicts even more so .",,,
0, warfare and conflict is currently regulated by the geneva conventions that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict and regulate the conduct of the involved actors .,,,
0," just as importantly there are rules on what weapons can be used through various treaties that ban weapons such as the land mine ban , and on when a state can legally initiate conflict through the un charter .",,,
0, in just the same way when a new area of potential conflict arises that too must be regulated by treaty .,,,
0, the internet and the threat of cyber-conflict is that new area at the moment .,,,
0, while cyber warfare is not currently a large scale threat it is still a form of conflict that could escalate just like any other - the pentagon has explicitly stated it could respond militarily to a cyber-attack .,,,
0," as a result it is most sensible to draw up the rules and regulations early , to ensure everyone knows the consequences and prevent damage by making sure that states agree not to engage in offence cyber-attacks against each other .",,,
0, once a treaty is set up to limit or eliminate cyber-attacks monitoring is unlikely to be a problem because states will be willing to monitor each other .,,,
0, states in order to defend themselves from cyber-attacks already monitor the cyber-attacks that occur -- the united states for example already has several cyber defense forces .,,,
0, if that is not enough then there are numerous private groups that will be monitoring cyber-attacks as most are made against corporate rather than government targets .,,,
0, for example private company mandiant exposed a unit of the people 's liberation army for its cyber-attacks in february.,,,
0, once a cyber-attack has been traced and evidence gathered if the appropriate domestic authorities wo n't deal with the culprit then an independent international institution can decide on the punishment for the government that is not living up to its treaty commitments .,,,
0, if there is a need for international monitoring rather than simply a dispute settlement mechanism then there are models available through current treaties ; a un organisation similar to the international atomic energy agency or international criminal court could be set up that can investigate incidents when asked .,,,
0," ever since the state rose to ascendancy over powerful internal actors , such as the nobility in a feudal system , the state has had a monopoly on the use of force .",,,
0, the state quickly became the only institution with the resources to maintain military forces and has become the only legitimate wielder of force .,,,
0, the internet however changes this .,,,
0, cyber-attacks are often by individuals or groups who can carry out a cross border attack without the aid of their home country .,,,
0," incia director leon panetta told congress `` when it comes to national security , i think this represents the battleground for the future .",,,
0, i 've often said that i think the potential for the next pearl harbor could very well be a cyber-attack . '',,,
0, if cyber-attacks are so important it stands to reason that the groups who are able to engage in such activities should be as limited as possible .,,,
0, while it is not always possible states try to make sure that the weapons of war for the most part remain in the hands of responsible actors .,,,
0, this should apply as much in cyberspace as elsewhere .,,,
0, while terrorist groups do exist -- and are occasionally armed by states -- for the most part they are seen by every government as being illegitimate .,,,
0," a treaty that bans , or sharply curtails cyber-attacks would benefit every state .",,,
0, even those who may currently benefit from cyber espionage would be better off signing up to the treaty .,,,
0, first most cyber-attacks are not carried out by the state even in countries like china where the state is using the internet as an offensive tool .,,,
0, in its annual report to congress the department of defence stated some cyber-attacks `` appear to be attributable directly to the chinese government and military '' but this does not sound like a majority .,,,
0, secondly no state wants a risk of conflict as a result of an unregulated new field of potential conflict .,,,
0, or even to risk relations with other nations ; cyber-attacks in large part go on because they are cost free .,,,
0, and finally all nations are the victims of cyber-attacks .,,,
0, the united states has repeatedly condemned cyber-attacks against it but china also claims that it is the victim of cyber-attacks .,,,
0, china 's minister of national defense general chang wanquan says `` china is one of the primary victims of hacker attacks in the world . '',,,
0, having a treaty against cyber attacks would not only make business easier for all countries but it would build up trust between nations where it is currently being eroded .,,,
1,the yasukuni shrine was established as the tōkyō shōkonsha inand renamed yasukuni shrine in 1879.,,,
1, this was immediately after the boshin war – a conflict between supporters of the shōgunate and those who wanted to restore the emperor to political power – the emperor meiji ordered the construction of the shrine to honor those who had died for their country during this war.,,,
1,“i assure those of you who fought and died for your country that your names will live forever at this shrine in musashino” so reads a poem composed by the emperor meiji for the shrine demonstrating the purpose of the shrine to honor those who have fought and died for japan.,,,
1, in this the yasukuni is not too dissimilar from other national cemeteries around the world.,,,
1,"  arlington national cemetery in the united states’ mission is “on behalf of the american people, lay to rest those who have served our nation with dignity and honor.”",,,
1, this is very similar to meiji’s poem.,,,
1, daejeon national cemetery in south korea’s introduction message says “daejeon national cemetery is the sacred place in which those who sacrificed themselves to protect and defend our people and nation are buried in peaceful rest”.,,,
1,where the yasukuni is different is in the controversy surrounding it.,,,
1," there are 2,466,000 souls enshrined at the shrine and almost all of these are military.",,,
1, they are from those who died during wars fought by japan from the bonshin war through to the second world war.,,,
1, however most of these conflicts (with the exception of the bonshin war and the satsuma rebellion) were wars of aggression.,,,
1,most controversial however is the enshrinement of war criminals.,,,
1," at the end of world war ii the victorious allies instituted the international military tribunal for the far east, otherwise known as the tokyo trials, to try those japanese who had played large roles in planning the war or had allowed criminal acts to take place.",,,
1, there were more thanjapanese charged with war crimes.,,,
1,of these are enshrined at yasukuni.,,,
1," fourteen of the enshrined are class a criminals, including the hideki tōjō prime minister during world war ii, who were convicted of crimes against peace “namely, planning, preparation, initiation, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing”.",,,
1,"not all japanese recognise that these people were war criminals with a phamphlet at yasukuni having stated “some 1,068 people, who were wrongly accused as war criminals by the allied court, were enshrined here”.",,,
1, many japanese consider the courts to be victor’s justice.,,,
1, there is therefore a conflict as a result of a minority in japan who believe they should honor their dead in yasukuni and essentially deny that the problem of war criminals exists.,,,
1,yasukuni is has only quite recently become a political controversy.,,,
1," during theyears fromto koizumi becoming prime minister there were only visits on four occasions by prime ministers, with only one of them an official visit.",,,
1, prime minister koizumi visited every year he was in office but prime ministers have not visited since.,,,
1," despite this controversy had continued as cabinet ministers continue to visit, the prime minister has sometimes sent an aide with an offering in his stead as abe did onaugust 2013, and each visit by any cabinet minister sparks protest and outrage from japan’s neighbours.",,,
1,"a related lesser controversy is that some of the 27,863 taiwanese andkoreans who are enshrined at yasukuni are there against the wishes of the deceased’s families leading to accusations that they have in effect been kidnapped in death.",,,
1,"p.s. this might be better with the motion switched around to be ‘this house would not visit the yasukuni shrine’ because the status quo is that politicians, including senior ones, visit almost every year.",,,
1, however i believe that making motions negative adds an element of confusion making it more difficult to follow.,,,
0," the arguments would be the same anyway, simply reversed.",,,
0,every nation should be allowed to honor its war dead how it wishes .,,,
0, wars are horrifying times and atrocities are almost always committed by all sides .,,,
0," japan 's actions in its wars , particularly the second world war were particularly brutal but this should not mean that japans leaders should be banned from paying their respects to their ancestors who died fighting for their country .",,,
0, most nations do this in one way or another .,,,
0, the difference is that yasukuni has those who were convicted criminals enshrined but others also honor those who have committed acts that might be considered criminal .,,,
0, perhaps the most extreme example is the mausoleum of mao zedong right at the heart of beijing where there are still big celebrations to mark his birthday -- unlike shintoism in japan maoism is still very much part of the ideology of the state .,,,
0, everyone is entitled to freedom of religion and that applies to the japanese as much as any other peoples .,,,
0, yasukuni is a shrine in the shinto religion -- equivalent to a church - and was the center of state shinto through the first half of the twentieth century .,,,
0, refusing to allow japanese ministers to visit the shrine might therefore be said to be similar to barring british politicians from westminster abbey because there is a memorial stone to oliver cromwell there and as a result it could be interpreted as offensive to the irish -- westminister abbey 's page notably avoids mentioning the wexford and drogheda massacres that are remembered by the irish .,,,

1,federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen.,,,
1, it is distinct both from systems of government where all executive authority rests with a single institution (unitary government) and also from those systems where the decisions at the highest level of government can affect only the state’s interactions with other states and not the functions of lower levels of government or its citizens (confederal government).,,,

1,"federalism implies a strong degree of subsidiarity, with power devolved to the lowest appropriate level, rather than a very centralised state (such as france or britain were before reforms in the 1990s).",,,

0, inability to help those areas that are less competitive is the main problem of a currency union without accompanying fiscal union .,,,
0, the euro has therefore built in the competitive advantage of germany ; it exports huge amounts to the euro 's periphery because these countries can not devalue their currency to make their products competitive .,,,

1," various attempts have been made to codify universal or fundamental human rights, but there exists no universally-followed list of rights.",,,
1," our current conception of human rights has in one sense its origins in the conceptions of the 'rights of man' which emerged during the enlightenment, but owes most of its current form and content to ideas which emerged in the wake of the second world war, as embodied in the united nations'universal declaration of human rights, which listed a large number of political, economic and social rights supposedly universally held by all people everywhere.",,,
1," this conception of human rights has been criticised, however, and the very idea of universal or fundamental human rights is by no means universally accepted by all nations and societies.",,,

0," every person has a right to the fulfilment of these needs as the alternative is non-existence , which is contrary to our basic human nature to survive .",,,
0," because all humans everywhere possess at birth a drive to survive and all share these requirements , they are clearly fundamental to our nature and we have a right to their fulfilment and protection .",,,
0," certain desires , such as the desire for happiness , are universal to all human beings .",,,
0," even if they actively deny them to others , every individual works towards the fulfilment of these desires for himself , and recognise that the denial of this fulfilment is harmful to himself .",,,
0," for example historically slave-owners still desired freedom of movement and labour for themselves , even if they denied it to their slaves on the basis of selfish interests .",,,
0," therefore , because all humans desire happiness for themselves , and also desire the means to this end such as freedom of speech and the freedom to make their own choices , there exists a universal basis of desire for human rights in every individual .",,,
0, the enshrinement of ` fundamental human rights ' simply universalizes what every individual acknowledges for himself : that the denial of certain rights is always harmful .,,,
0," this already even has a basis in the ` golden rule ' , to not do what is harmful to yourself to others , which can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition .",,,
0, all humans benefit from the protection of the human rights of others .,,,
0," for example , a society which guarantees the security of person for all its inhabitants means every individual can feel assured of their safety and thus live a happier and more productive life , whereas in a society where this was not guaranteed to all , everyone would have to live in fear of their person being violated in the present if they can not guarantee their own security , or in the future if they should lose the ability to protect themselves which they may enjoy in the present .",,,
0," this fear would lower the quality of life for all , and make society worse .",,,

1,"a hate crime is a crime, usually violent, motivated by prejudice or intolerance toward a member of a gender, racial, religious, or social group.",,,
1," in this resolution, hate crime ""enhancements"" refer to a court’s power to impose a heavier sentence on an offender if it is shown that his crime was motivated by racial hatred or other prejudices.",,,
1," for example, normal graffiti would not be punished severely, but if a swastika was sprayed onto a jewish temple, there is clear racial motive behind the crime and it would attract a much more severe sentence.",,,
1," this pertains to all other aspects of crime, i.e. a lynching would be punished much more severely than a regular homicide.",,,
1, most western liberal democracies' justice systems recognize hate crimes and punish them more severely.,,,
0," hate crime enhancements are unjust because they respond to two equal results , i.e. assault vs. racial mugging , with different punishments .",,,
0," we need to judge solely on the concrete actions of the aggressor in order to prevent punishments from being based on arbitrary judgements as to an offender 's `` intent '' , which can be very difficult to prove .",,,
0," otherwise `` intent '' may be supposed or argued in cases where it did not exist , leading to perverse sentencing whereby a crime is punished more harshly despite the true absence of intent .",,,
0," there is a danger of unjustly branding someone as bigoted and punishing them excessively , e.g. for their involvement in a bar fight where the victim coincidentally belonged to a minority group .",,,
0," juries might also be willing to make the logical leap that , because the aggressor was proved to hold bigoted views in general towards his victim 's ethnic group , these views must have motivated his actions in this individual incident , despite the absence of any evidence linking the specific brawl in a bar to the aggressor 's views .",,,
0," therefore it is unjust to punish two crimes with equal effects differently on the highly subjective basis of `` intent '' , and thus hate crime enhancements are unjust .",,,

0, the crime itself is no different from any other crime except that it is punished more harshly .,,,
0, why is this so ?,,,
0, because we are punishing an idea .,,,
0," all forms of violent crime , whether they are murders , rapes , or beatings are an expression of hatred toward another human being .",,,
0," to add more punishment to a crime because it represents a particular kind of hate , an idea , is to unfairly distinguish between different violent acts and trivialize those violent acts that do not appear to be motivated by prejudice hate .",,,
0," this is unjust because the idea itself does not cause harm , and is in fact legal in most cases , with the exception of direct incitement to violence , as racist or prejudiced statements and ideas are not illegal in most western liberal democracies .",,,
0," we allow extreme and prejudiced ideas to be legal because we recognise the value of free speech and open discourse in debating and discussing ideas , so as to best allow for progress in human thought .",,,
0," hate crime enhancements constitute an attack on this as they make an individual liable for harsher punishments for his actions if he holds certain views , and thus the law unfairly discriminates against these particular viewpoints and not against others , and so hate crime enhancements are unjust .",,,
0," by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another , rather than as being committed by individuals against their society , the labelling of crimes as `` hate crimes '' causes groups to feel persecuted by one another , and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime .",,,
0,  these effects spread beyond the hate crimes themselves .,,,
0," by prosecuting high-profile cases of white hate crimes against blacks , for example , it encourages blacks to see themselves as part of a distinct community different from the white community and whose relations are marked by crimes committed by one against the other .",,,
0," this is especially true when one community seems to perpetrate more hate crime , or at least more convictions thereof are secured , against another community than visa-versa .",,,
0," an analysis of hate crime date from the usa examining how hate crimes against whites are viewed with respect to hate crimes against blacks has hypothesised that the prevailing view in the minds of the public is that the crime that whites are most likely to commit against blacks is a hate crime , and that it is hard for most americans to envision a white person committing a crime against a black person for a different reason .",,,
0," the only white people who commit crimes against black people , goes the public belief , are racially prejudiced white extremists , and in contrast the very idea of hate crimes committed against whites is met with scepticism and disbelief .",,,
0,  there have been several high-profile cases in the usa where some individuals have argued actual hate crimes against whites were not treated as such as a consequence of such public disbelief .,,,
0,"  this can lead to an unjust situation where hate crime enhancements are , or are perceived as being , only applied `` against '' one community by another , despite hate crimes actually being committed by individuals within both communities against other individuals .",,,

1, it is therefore now available new regimes to refer their predecessors for prosecution if they have committed crimes against humanity or other war crimes; there has been a suggestion by geoffrey robertson that it might be the best place to try those who ordered attacks on protestors in ukraine during the winter of 2014.,,,

0, it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances .,,,
0," at the very least , those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better-resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy .",,,

1,hate speech is a controversial issue in all western liberal democracies (wlds).,,,
1," what makes hate speech on university campuses a unique topic is the combination of public space, the historical role of universities as centres of free speech and expression, and the age and impressionability of students.",,,

0, this reduces the net dialogue on university campuses and injures the quality of the dialogue that remains .,,,
0, members of groups that find themselves the targets of hate speech will be less likely to attend universities where they feel targeted .,,,
0," as a result , those campuses will become less diverse which will decrease the most effective deterrent of hateful ideas : understanding through interaction .",,,
0," less muslim , gay , jewish , etc. students on campus is exactly what those promoting hatred are trying to achieve .",,,
0, less students of the targeted group makes them easier to target because there are less people speaking out against the hate speech .,,,
0," a downward spiral is created that , if not checked , can drastically reduce campus diversity which is a massive harm to social integration and social harmony .",,,
0, speech codes or other censorship sends a signal to minorities that they are welcome in the university .,,,
0," when individuals feel that they will be targeted at a university based on who they are , they are less likely to attend that university either out of fear they will be discriminated against or because they believe that they will not be allowed to express themselves freely without being discriminated against or assaulted .",,,
0, no group should be discouraged from attaining higher education because of immutable personal characteristics .,,,

1,"an icc enforcement arm could take on a large number of forms, and its proponents have not formed a consensus around any one of them.",,,
1," it could be on various sizes, be based in one location or out of several.",,,
1, one area that would need to be established is if it were to be based on the complementarity principle that is used for making decisions to prosecute – the icc will not get involved unless the state is unable or unwilling to take action.,,,
1,what exactly would an enforcement arm for the icc look like?,,,
1," there have in the past been suggestions that there should be a united nations rapid reaction force capable of intervening in crisis situations of cases of state collapse, in the 1990s the un secretary general kofi annan decided against any attempt to create a un standing army, but wished to increase the rapidity of response using un members.",,,
1, what an enforcement arm for the icc means then could be anything from such a standing army down to a small force made up of experts that supports national militaries with training and technology based on the model of the multinational police forces set up in bosnia in the late 1990s.,,,
1,in this instance we intend to take a middle course between the extremes of a light training force and a full scale army.,,,
1, an icc enforcement arm would potentially be quite heavily armed as it may need to fight armed non-governmental groups but it would not have the capabilities to engage even the smallest states.,,,
1, it would not therefore be able to snatch a war criminal who is being specifically sheltered by a state.,,,
1, the mandate of the force would be to intervene either if asked to help internally by a national government or authorised by a united nations security council resolution which would to a certain extent enable the pursuit of a war criminal across borders.,,,
0, the remit of the icc is unlike the remit of any national court .,,,
0, it deals exclusively in crimes so unacceptable there is an international consensus behind their illegality and the need for prosecutions .,,,
0," the parties that signed up to the rome statute 's reason for the creation of the icc was `` that such grave crimes threaten the peace , security and well-being of the world '' the perpetrators of such crimes clearly need to be brought to book , and to do that they need to be apprehended .",,,
0, the same agreement said the signatories were `` resolved to guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement of international justice '' if this is the case then there should be agreement on enabling that enforcement by creating an icc enforcement arm .,,,
0, again the rome statute makes clear that the agreement `` shall not be taken as authorizing '' intervention by another state .,,,
0, this is why the enforcement needs to be done by a separate international force who could not be considered a threat to any state .,,,
0, quite simply there is little point in international criminal justice if there is no force to bring the criminals to the court .,,,
0, if international criminals are to be caught it needs to be clear that there is an organisation with the responsibility and authority to catch them .,,,
0, this is especially important when the criminal in question is able to slip across borders to avoid the national authorities in one state as joseph kony has done as the icc would be able to cross borders itself and coordinate the response from multiple countries .,,,
0, the importance of an organisation that is able to catch international criminals can be highlighted by the experience of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia where despite a memorandum of understanding relating to the detention of war criminals in bosnia nato denied it had the power to make arrests so leading to patrols actively avoiding wanted men to avoid a situation in which they might have to engage in arrests.,,,
0,a lack of clarity over whether an organisation can enforce its warrants for arrest results in arrests not being made .,,,
0, ultimately the icty was successful because this situation was resolved with the creation of multinational police forces backed up with traditional nato military power if necessary leading to the arrest ofindividuals .,,,
0," eight out of the thirty people indicted by the icc , four in the darfur situation , including omar al-bashir , three lord 's resistance army leaders in uganda and one in the dr congo investigation , are still alive and avoiding justice .",,,
0," an in-house enforcement arm would be more effective at capturing indictees than many of the forces of the state parties , as it is likely to be more competent than many of the under-resourced or under-trained national forces .",,,
0," an in house force would be solely focused on capturing the wanted war criminals so would both be focusing resources and much less likely to be sidetracked by other priorities , many of which may be influenced by politics , than national forces .",,,
0, one of the suggested solutions to the failure to capture joseph kony and leaders of the lra is to have greater involvement of peacekeepers ; an icc force would provide the same kind of help .,,,

1,"           the mechanism for this debate is fairly simple; that violent offenders who pose a serious safety risk to the public and those around them will be imprisoned, but those who commit non-violent crimes will instead receive alternative forms of punishment.",,,
1," these alternative punishment will probably follow the standards already set up, but you may wish to argue that they will be increased – for example, fines will be increased, community service hours will be longer, education or training programmes will be more vigorous and so on.",,,
0, it is practically unfeasible for the government to continue imprisoning people at this rate when prisons are already over capacity .,,,
0," sooner or later , we will have to accept that there is too great a burden on our prison facilities for this kind of sentencing to continue being used in so many cases .",,,
0," as such , we should give priority to imprisoning criminals who are genuinely dangerous and who have proved their violent tendencies already .",,,
0, these kinds of offences are the most traumatic for victims and we owe it to them to make sure that these criminals are physically distanced from the rest of society .,,,
0," however , while non-violent offenders have also committed a crime , they do not pose the same kind of danger which requires that they must be locked up ; in fact , those who commit small-scale crimes against society could be better rehabilitated by being forced to work to improve society through things like community service -- they will be less likely to damage a society which they feel a part of and have helped to build .",,,
0," when people hold a greater stake in their community , they value it more and are reluctant to damage it .",,,
0," those who advocate prison sentences for non-violent offenders often state two points : first , that the idea of being sent to prison is thought to act as a deterrent , and prevent people from committing crimes ; second , that people have do commit crimes and go to prison are less likely to re-offend .",,,
0, this is false on both counts .,,,
0," the idea of prison as a deterrent is immediately disproved by a rising violent crime rate , and the argument that these prisoners will not re-offend is disproved by the high rate of re-offending after a prison sentence , reaching up to% for some prisons .",,,
0," moreover , re-offending statistics are normally only based on crimes committed within a year of release ; there may be many , many more ex-prisoners who re-offend who are not recorded within these statistics .",,,
0, crimes which are committed impulsively and without forethought are rarely deterred by the possibility of punishment or being caught .,,,
0," however , non-custodial methods , such as electronic tagging , have shown promise in reducing recidivism rates .",,,
0," where prison has failed in deterring crimes , alternative forms of punishment have an opportunity to deter initial crime and lower rates of recidivism .",,,
0," sentencers have a wide array of options in their sentencing , and indeed the sentencing council states that sentencing should ` never be a rigid , mechanistic or scientific process ' .",,,
0," they have the option to make sentences more proportional to the crimes committed , and it is logical that the more serious crimes should receive the most serious sentences -- in this case , imprisonment .",,,
0," other options for sentencing could include fines , unpaid work , rehabilitation programmes , alcohol or drug treatments , curfews and supervision requirements .",,,
0," one key aim of sentencing is to convey moral censure , and to encourage offenders to truly consider the implications of their actions .",,,
0," however , offenders who feel that they have been punished too severely or treated unfairly , or that those who have committed worse crimes receive the same sentence , are less likely to respond to that moral message and benefit from it .",,,
0, this subsequently damages a key pillar of the criminal justice system -- the idea of rehabilitation .,,,
0, criminals who see themselves as unfairly treated by society have no reason not to strike out against society again by committing another crime .,,,
0," not only would alternative forms of punishment prevent this from happening , but it does not require the availability of prison and so is less of a burden on resources .",,,
0," heavier fines , longer community sentences and more strict curfews can easily be given as an appropriate sentence for non-violent offenders .",,,
0," merely having a criminal record which states that an individual was imprisoned , rather than given a more productive sentence such as community service , can have enormous implications on that individual 's future employment opportunities .",,,
0," this is particularly pertinent if it is a first offence , committed in a moment of stupidity .",,,
0, prisons are an isolating factor which separates the offender from their friends and family and distances them even further from the rest of society .,,,
0," this creates a ` cycle of crime ' where the offender 's closest acquaintances are those who they met in prison , rather than a supportive network of family and friends who can help this person to be reintegrated into society .",,,
0," not only does prison allow prisoners to share criminal ideas , but it may also reciprocally validate their illegal actions by creating a sense of camaraderie .",,,
0," this makes rehabilitation , and recognition of society 's moral values , much more difficult .",,,
0," ultimately , using prison for non-violent offences only introduces the offenders to more serious crimes , and makes it more difficult for the offenders themselves to be reintegrated , and for wider society to reintegrate them .",,,
1,"electronic ‘intercept’ evidence can involve recording information which has been sent using any form of electronic media, including phone calls from fixed lines and mobiles (cellphones), emails, and pager or sms messages.",,,
1, intercepted evidence can also include information and letters sent in the post.,,,
1," by intercepting this information, many countries hope to prevent crime and increase national security through preventing violent incidents.",,,
1," many countries already accept that wire-tapping is in fact necessary to prevent atrocities such as terrorism – particularly in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on new york - and that it is can be a highly effective way to combat ‘terror cells, war criminals and even mafia godfathers’.",,,
1," however, not all countries agree that the evidence gathered through wire-tapping is in accordance with legal principles.",,,
1, this has given rise to debates over whether intercepted and wire-tapped evidence should be admissible in court.,,,
1,many western countries currently deem that wire-tap evidence is admissible in court and is merely subject to the standard rules of evidence.,,,
1," however, wire-tap and intercept evidence is, or is meant to be, a last resort when the court finds that ‘normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.’",,,
1," this is generally interpreted by courts of law ‘to require only that law enforcement try some other techniques, not that they exhaust all reasonably available methods of obtaining the necessary evidence’.",,,
1," in either case, intercept evidence is not supposed to be used as an automatic option without other difficulties presenting themselves in due course of the investigation.",,,
1, while the law supposedly requires that law enforcement agents should not listen in on conversations which are obviously irrelevant to their case – such as personal phone calls among family and friends – it is rare that a wiretap is rejected in a court of law because the agents failed to minimise the tapping.,,,
1,"britain, ireland and some american states still do not always allow the use of this evidence.",,,
1," typically, warrants for taps can be issued by senior ministers (such as the home secretary in the uk) or by senior judges (in the usa) and must target a specific form of communication by a suspect rather than granted general authority to tap communication lines; for example, they may tap the landline, or emails, or a mobile phone.",,,
1," under the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) in the usa, ‘roaming’ taps (taps which cover any form of communication used by a suspect) do exist but are very rare.",,,
1," in conditions where a judge has granted authorisation for a ‘roaming’ tap, it is possible that all the public telephones (pay phones) in an area could be tapped if authorities suspected that terrorists could be in that neighbourhood.",,,
1, this is evidently a much more invasive and blanket-form of communications tapping.,,,
1," since terrorist activities around 9/11, the american government has been criticised for the extensive levels of wire-tapping and interception which were secretly authorised and even encouraged by the government.",,,
1," particularly, the legal grounding for the creation of the tapping schemes remains unclear and controversial.wire-tapping tends to target three main types of crime: terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking.",,,
1, many key drug trafficking trials in the usa have involved the admission of some kind of intercepted evidence.,,,
1," however, in most countries a separate discussion is held either in court or with a judge after the warrant has been obtained for a tap in order to determine whether the specific intercept evidence is admissible, or whether it should be suppressed.",,,
1," in the usa betweenand 1994, out of 8,489 criminal wiretaps judges across the us grantedsuppression motions to ‘exclude intercepted material from evidence’ but denied 3,060 pleas for a suppression motion.",,,
1, this ultimately resulted in a 4.3% suppression rate.,,,
1, this data shows that almost all of the evidence collected by interception and wiretapping within states which allow it to be used as evidence is ultimately used in court.,,,
1, no fisa evidence which has been introduced to a criminal case has ever been excluded from that case.,,,
0, wiretapping helps to make society safer ; we have the opportunity to prevent serious crime and to uphold the principle of prosecution in the justice system by catching criminals and convicting them .,,,
0," for example , in the uk in, intercepts led to the seizure oftonnes of drugs and also detected wide-scale fraud and money laundering , resulting inarrests .",,,
0," without this evidence , these criminals may have escaped the justice system and remained free in society to commit other crimes .",,,
0, it is nonsensical to reject evidence which clearly implicates this individuals who would otherwise be released without charge .,,,
0," as the threat of terrorism escalates and had already damaged many countries , refusal to use this evidence in court puts the public at serious risk and fails to act in the defence of the country in question .",,,
0," for example , if the norwegian authorities had kept closer tabs on information passed through ebay , they might well have been able to apprehend anders breivik before he committed the massacre on utoya island .",,,
0," wiretapping is unique in the variety of information it can provide ; it can show locations , times , the relationships between those involved and even record specific details of conspiracies .",,,
0," accordingly , it can also be used to prove the innocence of somebody who might otherwise be wrongly accused or even wrongly imprisoned .",,,
0, the obvious benefits to this motion demand that intercept evidence and wiretapping should be held as legitimate evidence in court .,,,
0," intercept evidence offers the opportunity to speed up court trials and stop wasting time and money by providing information which could lead to a faster , more accurate verdict .",,,
0," other western democracies who use wire-tap evidence believe that is has or will help to achieve criminal convictions , which demonstrates popular support for it as an effective and swift method of justice .",,,
0," given that the uk has allowed wire-tapping in some specific cases , it seems to be that it is not the principle of intercept evidence itself which is viewed as unacceptable by these countries , but perhaps a need to set up a formalised system of the conditions when and where intercept evidence can be used .",,,
0," david bickford , the former chief legal adviser to mi5 , has stated ` i know we have lost cases as a result of not using such evidence ' and other experts have called for the wide use of intercept evidence in court .",,,
0," allowing the use of intercept evidence in the first place may well ensure that wire-taps are better carried out in a standardised , regulated manner britain in particular seems to hold a paradoxical set of values in relation to intercept evidence .",,,
0," for example , british courts have allowed intercept material which has been lawfully obtained by foreign police forces .",,,
0, one notable example of this was the conviction of the merseyside drugs squad chief elmore davies when it was discovered that he had a corrupt relationship with drug baron curtis warren .,,,
0," the information which led to his conviction was collected on dutch mobile phones by the dutch police force , despite the fact that some of the conversations took place wholly within the uk .",,,
0," however this -- bizarrely -- was allowed as evidence in a british court , despite the systematic rejection of intercept evidence in other cases .",,,
0," when a country seems to recognise and even capitalise on the potential of intercept evidence in some cases but simultaneously reject it in others , the result is inconsistent legal standards which damage accountability and transparency of the entire state .",,,
0," intercept evidence can be very useful for showing associations between groups of people , which can be incredibly helpful in cases such as conspiracies to link people and events together .",,,
0, it can also expose inconsistencies or falsity in an individual 's alibi or personal character if they deny contact with a certain party where intercept evidence proves that they had communicated .,,,
0," however , under the status quo the defence lawyer may not be authorised to intercept evidence which would prove their client 's innocence .",,,
0," allowing such techniques would help to equalise the prosecution and defence ; after all , the aim of court is not to blindly prosecute the defendant , but to ascertain whether he or she is in fact guilty before any prosecution occurs .",,,
0, widening the array of tools which can be used by both prosecution and defence helps to encourage a wider view of the case and arrive at a more accurate verdict .,,,
1,"under the status quo in most english-speaking jurisdictions, a defendant’s previous convictions cannot be brought up in court until after the jury has given its verdict.",,,
1," this includes scotland, america, canada, australia, new zealand and britain.",,,
1," this is because these countries believe that each case should be evaluated on its own merits, and that ‘knowledge of previous offences would prejudice the outcome of a trial’.",,,
1," however, other countries such as france allow previous convictions to be disclosed before a verdict is reached.",,,
1," exceptions are made in britain in cases where the case under trial is ‘strikingly similar’ to a past offence, in which case it is believed that the value of the evidence ‘outweighs any prejudicial effect’.",,,
1, previous convictions may also be disclosed if the defendant ‘falsely claims to be of good character’.,,,
1," though previous convictions are not currently disclosed before the verdict of guilty or not guilty, judges may consider previous convictions when they decide the sentence for defendants deemed guilty.",,,
1, there is a great interest in making sure that criminals are adequately punished for their crimes – particularly where recidivism shows that previous punishment has had little effect – in the interest of justice and public safety.,,,
1,"                when choosing a mechanism for this debate, you may wish to think about the scope of argument and breadth of debate you want to have.",,,
1," the first option is to defend a criminal justice system which allows previous convictions to be revealed in a case of similarity to past convictions, where the defendant falsely claims good character, or where the defendant attacks the character of a prosecution witness, as is the status quo in britain.",,,
1, this takes on a smaller burden for the proposition and highlights particular points where past convictions could certainly be pertinent to the case and its relevance is pinpointed.,,,
1, the other option is to defend the model used by france where previous convictions are routinely disclosed.,,,
1, this requires the proposition to argue that the majority of cases would actively benefit from these disclosures by citing high recidivism rates after an initial offence and more general issues such as greater transparency within the courtroom.,,,
1," this is a wider debate with more potential for principles, rather than practical, arguments.",,,
0," it is unfair that those who repeatedly re-offend should be treated in the same manner as those who have committed one offence ; a singular offence could mark a mistake or accident in the defendant 's choices , but repeated criminal acts mark a habit and a lack of regret for past crimes .",,,
0," failing to take past convictions into account can lead to many dangerous offenders being underestimated by the jury , and so released .",,,
0," this is particularly pertinent in cases of child molestation , where child molesters have a particularly high rate of re-offending -- expected to be even ` larger than the reportedper cent ' - but ` only a small proportion of sexual offences against children result in a conviction ' .",,,
0," this conviction rate , however , does rise for ` those with a history of prior sexual offences ' .",,,
0," under the current conditions , this system is unfairly weighted against the innocent victims of repeated crime .",,,
0," a higher conviction rate , informed by the knowledge of previous offences , helps to reach justice for these victims and their families , as well as promoting justice and the safety of the general public who find it frustrating that so many dangerous offenders are released without appropriate conviction .",,,
0," moreover , jurors themselves lose confidence in the justice system when they find out that they have just acquitted a defendant who has committed a similar crime before .",,,
0," one notable example of this was series of trials of kirk reid , who committed many sexual assaults against women including several instances of rape and who was ` wrongfully acquitted ' of his first offence in.",,,
0, not only did his victim lose all sense of hope in the justice system -- she had faced her attacked and been discredited -- but one of the jurors at the trial who believed that he was guilty went on to criticise the justice system itself .,,,
0, the current system seriously risks acquitting criminals who have already committed similar crimes ; it is time to rebalance the justice system to acknowledge the needs of the victims who suffer through wrongful acquittal of their attackers .,,,
0, it is nonsensical to withhold evidence from a jury that might be necessary for them to reach an accurate verdict .,,,
0," just because their verdict might be more prone to conviction rather than acquittal does not necessarily mean that this is an unfair or even inaccurate conclusion ; given that violent offenders are likely to re-offend , it may illuminate the truth rather than confuse it .",,,
0, jurors should be allowed to weigh the relevance of previous convictions and compare them with the accusations of the trail at hand .,,,
0, a criminal justice system which currently relies on the ability of the jury to make a decision can not legitimately choose to withhold evidence from them without innately biasing the trial itself .,,,
0," as the uk government 's white paper states , ` we want less evidence to be withheld from the courts , on the principle that relevant evidence should be admissible ... magistrates , judges and juries have the common sense to evaluate relevant evidence and should be trusted to do so ' .",,,
0," if we can not trust juries to decide which evidence is relevant to the verdict and which is not , then the entire use of juries in the criminal justice system should be reconsidered .",,,
0," jurors are frequently affected by media coverage of particular cases , which makes it almost impossible for them to remain impartial in the idealistic way which opposition naively believes possible .",,,
0, this creates a situation where the jury may be more affected by information which they have found out elsewhere -- for example on the news or in newspapers -- than the information which is presented to them in court .,,,
0," there have been some cases where jurors search the internet to find the backgrounds to their cases , despite the fact that this is not allowed .",,,
0, this evidently reflects that jurors feel that they have not been adequately informed and so seek facts elsewhere .,,,
0," given that this need has been reflected by the jurors themselves , the court should give jurors all possible information and bring previous convictions into the open to ensure that they can base their verdict on reliable fact presented in court rather than resorting to sensationalist media .",,,
0, this motion could allow innocent defendants to mount a stronger case .,,,
0," this is because , if allowed , the previous convictions of prosecution witnesses would be admitted as evidence .",,,
0," in this case , if a prosecution witness falsely claims good character in opposition to the defendant , any falsity could be more easily seen and weighed by the jury .",,,
0," this solves a problem under that status quo where ` the threat of introducing his , the defendant 's , previous convictions will frequently inhibit him from introducing character evidence about the prosecution witness ' ; fear that the defendant 's convictions may weigh against them where the prosecution witness remains untouchable creates a discrepancy in the justice system .",,,
0," however , if convictions on both sides were to be revealed anyway , then neither can falsely claim the character of the other and attempt to convince the jury of false information on this front .",,,
0," at present in britain , some previous convictions may be disclosed if they bear a striking resemblance to the case at trial , if the defendant falsely claims to be of good character , or if they attack the character of a prosecution witness .",,,
0," however , different judges invariable interpret these criteria in different ways , which leads to a wavering standard of trail where previous convictions may or may not be revealed .",,,
0, it would be much more efficient and transparent to allow this motion and make court procedures more accessible .,,,
1,"following the horrific killing ofelementary school children and teachers in newtown, connecticut, by adam lanza using a bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle, that resulted in all his victims being hit more than once, dianne feinstein has said that she will introduce a bill in the senate to ban assault weapons.",,,
1, the united states has had an assault weapons ban before; fromto 2004.,,,
1," the ban however lapsed inas it was set in motion for only ten years unless it was renewed, which congress decided not to do.",,,
1, feinstein says that the new bill will “take my bill from '94 toand perfect it.”,,,
1," detailed below is a summary of theassault weapons ban in the united states, which states ""title xi, subtitle a of the violent crime control and law enforcement act ofimposed a 10-year ban on the “manufacture, transfer, and possession” of certain semiautomatic firearms designated as assault weapons (aws).",,,
1," the ban is directed at semiautomatic firearms that have features that appear useful in military and criminal context and rifles but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defence (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers).",,,
1," the law bansmodels and variations by name, as well as revolving cylinder shotguns.",,,
1," it also has a “features test” provision banning other semiautomatics having two or more military-style features…the ban also prohibits most ammunition feeding devices holding more thanrounds of ammunition (referred to as large capacity magazines, or lcms).",,,
1," aloln lcm is arguably the most functionally important feature of most aws, many of which have magazines holdingor more rounds.",,,
1, the lcm ban’s reach is broader than that of the aw ban because many non-banned semiautomatics accept lcms.,,,
1, approximately 18% of civilian-owned firearms and 21% of civilian-owned handguns were equipped with lcms as of 1994.”,,,
1,the previous ban exempted assault weapons and large capacity magazines manufactured before the law’sintroduction.,,,
1, leaving the loophole that older guns could still be imported with the result that 4.7 million pre-ban lcms were imported into the usa fromthrough 2000.,,,
1," this is a loophole feinstein claims would be eliminated in the new bill as ""it will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession.",,,
1,  not retroactively but prospectively.,,,
1," and it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more thanbullets.""",,,
1, however as the ban won’t be retroactive it will not take assault weapons off the streets entirely if it was to be passed; its most significant result could potentially be as a stepping stone if it were to show some value in the regulation of firearms.,,,
1,"any attempt to renew the ban would be controversial, even after two large scale shootings, one in aurora and the other in newtown.",,,
1, the national rifle association is a powerful lobbying group that would fight any attempt to ban assault weapons.,,,
1, indeed progress has in recent decades been going in favour of reaffirming the right to hold arms not to limit it.,,,
1, in district of columbia v. heller the supreme court ruled that the right to possess a firearm was unconnected with service in a militia and so overturned a ban in the district of columbia on handguns and init was ruled in mcdonald v chicago that the second amendment is incorporated under the fourteenth amendment so the right to bear arms is protected from infringement by local and state government as well as federal government.,,,
1,n.b. while this debate is assuming that retroactively banning assault weapons will not be on the table if it was this would make proposition’s case much easier as it is rather a large loophole and many of the arguments would be much more powerful with a more complete ban.,,,
0," put simply assault weapons are designed for assault , therefore their proliferation should be prohibited in law .",,,
0," to put things into the general context of gun crime within the united states every year 17,000 people are killed ,percent of them with guns and nearly 20,000 people commit suicide by shooting themselves .",,,
0," murder by gunfire particularly affects children , in total well over a million americans have died in this manner andpeople continue to be shot in the states every day .",,,

0," the period of the federal assault weapons ban from 1994-2004 with the exception of, the year of the columbine massacre , which notably involved a semi-automatic produced before the ban , was also a peaceful period in terms of numbers of mass shootings .",,,
0, while assault weapons are responsible for a relatively small amount of total gun deaths in the usa that is not a good reason for not banning them ; any life saved is worthwhile .,,,
0, taking the low estimate of% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high% means 630-700 lives that could be saved .,,,

0, to use an assault weapon would to spray an assailant with bullets from an assault weapon would be using disproportionate force that will not only harm the assailant but will likely hit anyone else nearby .,,,

0, these weapons are `` intended to wound rather than to kill '' so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer .,,,
0, moreover he also concedes `` a hunter will carry only a few rounds '' so the large capacity magazine is also useless for sport .,,,
0, many who are pro guns argue that it would be illegitimate for assault weapons to be banned while the police have them .,,,
0," police forces , however , are going to be much more likely , and able to give them up when a ban is in place .",,,
0, the police do n't want to be involved in an arms race with criminals to have the biggest guns ; just look at the british police force where there is little gun crime and few shootings of police officers it is not felt that there is the need to have police armed with more than a taser or even truncheon .,,,
0, put simply a ban on assault weapons can help reverse the arms race between police and criminals .,,,
0, civil liberties would also be enhanced as law enforcement agencies would not need to devote so many resources into monitoring assault weapons purchases and those who have done the purchasing .,,,
0, instead they would be able to simply target all assault weapons purchases as needing immediate attention .,,,
0, finally we must remember that this ban enhances the highest liberty at all ; life .,,,
0, today as justice breyer says `` gun possession presents a greater risk of taking innocent lives '' than not having a gun .,,,
0," yes a ban would not immediately take assault weapons off the streets but there would be significant long term benefits as highlighted by connecticut senator joe liberman `` we ought to restore the assault weapons ban -- not to take anybody 's guns away that they have now , but to stop the manufacturing of these weapons . ''",,,
0, the ban would stop manufacturers from making the weapons and with the legislation improved from theversion it would be possible to prevent the cosmetic changes that were made to keep guns on the market .,,,
0, this would mean that prices both in the usa and globally would increase as there would be less supply .,,,
0, one positive result might also be help to change the united states ' position on the arms trade treaty which would further restrict global supply .,,,
0, this would answer mexican calls to cut off the supply of guns into the country that helps make the drugs violence in the country so deadly both by meaning less of the weapons are made and by helping to cut off the route through which weapons get into mexico .,,,
0," a ban on assault weapons would not fix mexico but it would deprive arms smugglers of the closest , easiest and cheapest place to buy the arms used by the drugs cartels .",,,
1,"many of the arguments in this debate relate directly to interpretation of the second amendment to the constitution of the united states of america: ""a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to bear arms, shall not be infringed.",,,

0," given that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries - as a result of incompetence or recklessness - than a knife , it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available .4 aside from the fact that handguns are uniquely dangerous weapons , when the handgun ban was in place in dc , there was a reported decrease in crime in the area .",,,

0, if criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it .,,,
0," however , it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large .",,,
0," specifically , the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are , but simply ca n't pin them for arrest , such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street .",,,

0," this would be the case when public safety is at risk , for example if the client holds some very vital information but is not willing to disclose it to anyone other than his lawyer .",,,
0, in such cases the courts should weigh up and balance the client 's interests against society 's and make the decision accordingly rather than rigidly sticking to attorney-client privilege .,,,

0," true , people also experience unhappy times , and they sometimes negatively affect others , but in all but an exceptionally small number of cases , the net contribution of a human life to total utility is positive , indeed , if it were n't , we probably would n't consider death to be bad .",,,
0, even though there will be some fluctuations in how much each life contributes to total utility -- a happy doctor probably adds more utility than a miserable meter maid -- it is overwhelmingly likely that saving the five lives will result in a situation of greater utility than preserving the life of the one .,,,

1,the events of september 11thresulted in governments all over the world taking extraordinary measures to enhance the security of their citizens.,,,
1, whether this was justified or not is yet another flashpoint in the age old battle of liberty versus security.,,,
1,"in the us, new security measures included unparalleled airport checkpoint procedures, face recognition devices in public places, tracking, monitoring and identification through thumb printing of certain categories of visitors, random searches of internet content by intelligence officers, the ability to demand records on somebody from any business or organisation, the use of wiretaps and the ability to intercept and read email, and eavesdropping on conversations between a lawyer and their client.",,,
1," the possible use of racial profiling to target “suspicious individuals” for more thorough searches and questioning is also being seriously discussed, although allegedly not in operation.",,,
1," most of these measures are associated with loss of privacy; liberty has also been directly infringed through the detention without charge or trial of non-citizens, on the grounds they do not enjoy the same rights as citizens, the designation of us citizens as enemy combatants and their indefinite detention, and by trying suspects through military tribunals rather than in a normal court with judge and jury.",,,
1,"on the one hand, extraordinary security measures are required to counteract the imminent threats of terrorism that has become much more cunning and resourceful over the last decade.",,,
1," on the other hand, the introduction of these measures comes at the expense of sacrificing some of our most cherished civil liberties and rights as citizens.",,,
0," no doubt, there is a trade-off between security and liberty, but what is the ideal balance between them?",,,
0,"terrorism is part of the modern world and is inextricably linked with the rise of modern communications , the internet , and a global community .",,,
0," this is an age in which space and time are bending to the tune of new media -- information at your fingertips may sound nice , but for those who want to destroy , it only makes their object easier to attain .",,,
0, and so more strict national security measures must be employed in order to keep up with the enemy .,,,
0," escalation is the name of the game imposed on governments around the world by terrorists for example the mumbai terrorists used gps systems to guide them into mumbai , attacks were coordinated on cell and satellite phones and blackberrys were used to monitor the international reaction .",,,

0," the government needs to secure state-security first ; only then can the debate on civil liberties begin , and only then .",,,
0, negative cases of security abuse are few and have been greatly exaggerated by an emphatic civil rights lobby that has no empathy for the victims of terrorism .,,,
0," of course , with any wide-scale attempt to fight terrorism there are bound to be a few cases of abuse of security measures .",,,
0," for example in the uk terrorism suspects were originally detained without charge under the anti-terrorism , crime and security act however the detention was declared unlawful by the law lords inso the government introduced new scaled back policies such as ` control orders ' .",,,

0," the issue of the erosion of a few minor liberties of , states like the us 's , citizens should be overlooked in favour of the much greater issue of protecting the very existence of that state .",,,
0," let us not forget that is with the consent of the public that these security measures are taken , cctv for example was a populist measure that has often been considered a threat to civil liberties .",,,
0, it is in line with democratic ideals ; the majority of the country wants greater security .,,,
0, for example in59 % of americans wanted the patriot act extended .,,,
0, and because democracy embodies all those values we are fighting for -- freedom and equality included - we must adhere to a democratic spirit when deciding on how to organise ourselves or else risk falling into the same mind-set as those terrorists themselves .,,,
0, it would be incredibly disingenuous of the opposition if they did not concede that the dangers are great and that something must be done .,,,
0," because , deep down , everyone knows that it is simply a balancing of risks -- in practice all the government is trying to do is save lives .",,,

1,the issue of when a child is mature enough to consent to various decisions is a complicated one and this debate focusses on just one part; those decisions that relate to their medical well-being.,,,
1," there are a number of areas where the consent of parents is required – surgery, transplants, blood transfusion and others where the child is not able to give consent because they are too young; circumcision being one obvious example.",,,
1," many jurisdictions stress that the child should be involved wherever possible but, the decision lies with the parents, or in their absence, a court.",,,
1,"put simply, the doctor is free to use their medical judgement in an emergency situation – an arrival in an emergency room or accident and emergency department but where there is time available to ask for consent it must be sought from both the young person and their parents.",,,
1,"for example the general medical council in the uk sets out;in many case, parents are happy to take the advice of doctors for their children, just as they would for themselves.",,,
1," however, and this is the focus of this debate, there are occasions where there is a conflict between the values or beliefs of the parent(s) and the general consensus of medical opinion.",,,
1," the contention of some doctors is that it is unfair for the parents to make a decision, that could cost the child her life, and that she may not have taken that decision later in life.",,,
1,"this is further complicated by the fact that many children, especially younger children, share the views of their parents, somewhat uncritically.",,,
1," therefore, the doctor and the courts face the question of whether the doctor is able to overrule the opinions of both, let us say, a teenager and their parents.",,,
1, this will focus on the issue of blood transfusion for teenage children of parents who are members of the jehovah’s witnesses (jws).,,,
1,the issue of whether the rejection of transfused blood is in and of itself sensible is irrelevant both legally and in this debate.,,,
1,.,,,
1,  nobody disputes that the lack of medical action is a risk in medical terms – and one that may lead to death.,,,
1, the issue for debate is whether the religious views of the parents or the medical opinion of the doctors should have primacy in determining the correct course of action.,,,
1," the debate is about who should have the right to decide, not what that decision should be.",,,

0," asking doctors to take other considerations into account is not only a breach of their professional integrity , it also poses grave risks for society .",,,
0," they are being asked , in this situation , to allow the opinions of a third party take precedence over the wellbeing of their patient .",,,
0," if this were a younger relative with their eye on an inheritance or a distant sibling seeking to settle an old score , the dangers would be all too apparent .",,,

1,the ideal of participatory democracy is to give ordinary citizens the possibility of participating in the public decision-making.,,,
1, the very idea of democracy has changed significantly from the ancient greek direct democracies to the dominant form of liberal representative democracy existing today in most of the modern nation-states.,,,
1," while in the ancient greek laws and important decisions were debated and voted on by an assembly comprising of every single citizen, the modern liberal democracies are based on the political representation and elites' competition.",,,
1,"  ancient democracies were little city-states like athens that allowed only a few thousand of their people to be “citizens”, making it possible for the entire voting population to be gathered in one place while leaving the labour in the hands of the slaves and women and even for representatives to be elected on the basis of a lottery.",,,
1, for modern nation-states with universal suffrage this is impractical.,,,
1," modern democracies with mass electorates are all representative democracies in which elected politicians make decisions on behalf of the people, rather than the people making decisions directly.",,,
1," although purely direct democracy may be impractical, there are several ways in which representative democracies can become much more participative.",,,
1," in other words, there are several ways in which a more participatory approach of democracy can allow citizens to become direct contributors to the public decisions and improve the political representation in our liberal institutions.",,,
1, several political participatory formulas already exist today.,,,
1," some of them are already consolidated in current democracies, for example primary elections in political parties, limitation of mandates and rotation of public positions.",,,
1," other examples are less common but growing, for figure constitutional or legislative refrenda, popular legislative initiative, or participatory budgeting.",,,
1," california, for example, allows its citizen-initiated referenda: anyone can propose a new law, and if they can get enough signatures on a petition in support of it, the law is put directly to the people in a public vote.",,,
1, another example is the right of recall: allowing citizens to force early elections if enough of them sign a petition saying they are unhappy with the current government (used in california and british columbia).,,,
1," there are significant examples regarding participatory budgeting, such as porto alegre (brasil), where citizens are involved directly in the configuration of the public investments throughout territorial and sectorial meetings with experts, politicians, civil society organisations and individual citizens.",,,
1, much greater participation is also increasingly possible as a result of online voting and discussion that avoids the problem of bringing millions of people to one place to make decisions.,,,
1,"then, if we imagine a continuum between a complete direct democracy, where all the citizens participate in all public decisions, and a pure representative one, where the government of public affairs lies solely in the hands of political or representative elites, we can see that some kind of intermediate formulas might be discussed and applied in the existing democratic political communities.",,,
1, we should understand democracy as a gradual process instead of a binary concept.,,,
1, this means thinking of government as a phenomena that can be more or less democratic rather than only democratic or nondemocratic.,,,
1," as a result we will see that participatory forms of government can improve both, the efficiency and the sustainability of our political institutions in the era of technological and educational revolution we live today.",,,
0, representative democracy is oppressive because it takes more power away from the people than is strictly necessary .,,,
0," whilst a completely direct democracy is impractical , we should nevertheless recognise that there is no reason not to have as much direct democracy as possible .",,,
0," in the words of herbert marcuse , `` free election of masters does not abolish the masters or the slaves '' .",,,
0," the key point is that merely holding an election every four years does not fundamentally alter our state of subservience : at election time , we are given a choice of three or four manifesto programmes on an all-or-nothing basis , manifestos which may never be honoured .",,,
0," the only power over our government we as citizens have is the power to punish politicians retrospectively , by voting them out after years of obeying them .",,,
0," it is quite possible to create an authoritarian system that has regular representative elections , even with several competitive candidates and yet still not be giving power to the people , as is shown by iran .",,,
0, this is wrong .,,,
0, the presumption should always be that the people keep as much power over their own lives and hand as little to their masters as possible because they never get to consent to the powers that rule them .,,,
0," given that we are born under governments which exist whether we like it or not , it as an offense to our natural liberty and equality that those governments should hold any more power over us than is absolutely necessary .",,,
0," besides , when the interests of the state are not the interests of the people , we have the government of the few over the rest .",,,
0, representative democracy is less legitimate because it empowers unelected elites .,,,
0," representative democracy is systematically biased against ordinary people , particularly poor people .",,,
0," unelected elites like wealthy businessmen , trade union leaders , civil servants , party officials and media proprietors are able to bypass the democratic process and exert direct pressure on elected politicians .",,,
0, this happens because decisions are made behind closed doors by individual politicians who can be easily bullied or bought out .,,,
0, this allows elites to effectively wield public power even when they are not elected themselves .,,,
0, if decisions were made more directly by the people there would be less scope for elites to manipulate the process by simply appealing to a politician 's self-interest .,,,
0, elite influence is a systematic problem because it is self-reinforcing : elites lobby for laws to preserve their own power and disempower the public .,,,
0, a good example of this is rupert murdoch 's behind-the-scenes lobbying for the repeal of regulations preventing him from dominating the media market .,,,
0," considering that at any past time in the human history the conditions of equality in labour division , education and technological tools were not as favourable as nowadays in terms of allowing citizen political involvement , a more participatory political decision-making must be now taken into account .",,,
0, a clear example is the iceland 's `` wiki constitution ''  .,,,
0," then , although the classic criticism against direct democracy formulas based on the premise that size creates problrms -- referring to the difficulties to shape participatory citizen deliberation in our enormous current nation-states -- may still be true , cultural , social and technological conditions for participation have become much more favourable .",,,
0," representative systems struggle to sustain popular trust , which is bad for democracy .",,,
0, public trust in politics always tends to be dented by three specific features of representative systems .,,,
0," firstly , the perception of elite influence over the political process is a largely unavoidable feature of electoral democracy because such elites are easily placed to manipulate politics , even if they do not actually do so .",,,
0," secondly , the spotlight in representative democracy is on individual politicians , rather than on policies , and consequently exposing scandals and smearing the characters of politicians is an essential part of the political game : media coverage of politicians is largely hostile , particularly problematic if it diverts discussion from the merits and demerits of particular policies .",,,
0," a third feature of the system is that , since public opinion has no direct power , unpopular decisions do n't have to be properly justified .",,,
0," governments often defy public opinion when they think a policy will pay off in the long run , and often they do n't really bother explaining why they are doing so , a good example of this is gordon brown 's signing of the lisbon treaty in.",,,
0, these three factors all tend to undermine trust in politics in representative systems .,,,
0," trust is essential for democracy because without it people will not bother following politics or voting , leaving the door open for elites and aggressive minorities to wield undue influence .",,,
0," a clear example of this phenomenon is in the united states , where christian fundamentalists -- despite being a minority -- wield enormous power .",,,
0," the reason for this is that turnout in american elections is very low , whilst fundamentalist christians are politically very active and organised , allowing them huge influence .",,,
0, giving people more responsibility for making political decisions is itself a good thing .,,,
0," participating in political decision-making allows citizens to achieve a higher state of intellectual and moral maturity , letting them lead better and wiser lives .",,,
0, since the difficult business of government forces them to learn how to make tough choices and compromise they will quickly abandon their simplistic prejudices and assumptions .,,,
0," representative democracy is the opposite : it treats the public as if they are incapable of making important choices themselves , and thus denies most citizens a chance to meaningfully participate .",,,
0," representative democracy often implies a mercantile vision of the political performance , where the politicians play the role of the sellers and the voters act as a simple buyers of political options .",,,
0," this means that the vast majority of voters remain ignorant at best , and apathetic at worst .",,,
0, this leaves them vulnerable to manipulation by deceitful politicians and political commentators .,,,
0," furthermore , since many government decisions involve major moral dilemmas , citizens who participate in such decision-making will develop a more nuanced moral understanding and more thoughtful personal conduct .",,,
0," thus , all democratic participation is beneficial .",,,
0, participatory forms of democracy allows people to participate more than they otherwise would .,,,
0, evidence for the impact of democratic participation is that radical and intolerant views are frequently expressed in young democracies but fade away as participation in democratic politics implants in the people respect for due process and different points of view .,,,
0, a good example of this is that intolerant far-right parties are much more successful in the young democracies of eastern europe than the old democracies of western europe .,,,
0, participatory democracy will lead to better decisions because laws will only be passed if they can be justified to the people .,,,
0, professional politicians are disproportionately drawn from the privileged classes and are often ignorant of the effects their policies will have on ordinary people -- as are the civil servants who advise them .,,,
0," moreover , professional politicians are susceptible to corruption , lobbying or bullying by powerful vested interests seeking to direct government policy away from the general interest represented by the vast majority of the individual citizens , who generally lack such a determinant influence over the decision-making .",,,
0, participatory democracy will therefore make sure that the legislation that is passed will help the people as much as possible ; for example they will limit unecessary bureaucracy and make sure that policies are fair .,,,
0, thus for example switzerland has passed with% of the vote in a referendum a proposal that prevents big payouts for managers known as ` golden handshakes ' and ` golden parachutes ' and shareholders will have a veto over saleries .,,,
1,the issue of big versus small government is a significant in the election campaigns of many countries – and has recently been the subject of many hysterical pronouncements in the us.,,,
1," in reality no incoming government does that much to change the overall size of government as there are, in practice, only so many savings that can be made or new initiatives that can be launched within the confines of acceptable levels of taxation.",,,
1,this argument is a particularly interesting one to study in the us as it is so ripe for the pricking of illusions on both sides of the political divide.,,,
1,even arriving at a definition of what is meant by ‘the size of government’ is problematic.,,,
1," as this debate will focus on the united states, it may be worth dealing with a few popular misconceptions before they take hold, although there is plenty of room to work around these, as will be demonstrated in the substantive material itself.",,,
1,"partisans on both sides would find explanations for these figures, which, in reality, would have little to do with reality.",,,
1, instead it should be noting that this debate has more to do with (in addition to sophistic rhetoric) the attitudes and intentions of the two great tribal herds of us politics than it does with anything else.,,,
1," it is, ultimately, a debate about political philosophy rather than political economy.",,,
1, the fact that the cost of government has increased under every single successive president is one universally ignored.,,,
1, such counter-intuitive realities can be observed in a huge number of political situations; it really say anything surprising about politics but is a good reason to double check the facts relied on by participants in a debate.,,,
1,"essentially the philosophical differences are these: those in favor of small government believe that individuals, their families and communities are better placed than the state to help themselves and those around.",,,
1," by doing so, individuals learn valuable skills of self-reliance and self-respect.",,,
1, by contrast those who favor government-led action tend to believe that society as a whole should take responsibility for ensuring a certain quality of living for all its members and that by ensuring that there is a safety net people are better able to overcome transient crises or social inequalities in order to become helpful members of society.,,,
1,the other key aspect of the debate is the role of taxation in society.,,,
1," those in favor of small government tend to believe that reducing the overall tax burden will stimulate the economy as a whole, by promoting enterprise, investment and entrepreneurialism.",,,
1," they say that this, in turn creates jobs and “wealth”.",,,
1, small government conservatives generally abide by the mantra that individuals know how to spend their money better than the federal government does.,,,
1,"those associated with a big government approach tend to favor the use of tax as a redistributive system arguing that by taking a small amount from those who can afford it (obviously one person’s ‘small’ is not that of another) the government can use it to improve services such as education across the board, to everyone’s benefit.",,,
0," government , especially in a developed nation and even more so in the wealthiest nation in the world , should be able to ensure that children are not hungry , the mentally ill are not living on the streets , borders are policed , veterans do n't live in squalor , the population can read , crime is controlled , the elderly do n't freeze to death and a million other markers of a civilized society .",,,
0, this is particularly true of children but most people need a helping hand at one time or another in life .,,,
0," however , the obscenity of children destined to fail before their lives have even started - condemned to schools that offer no hope and communities that offer no safety - would be disturbing anywhere in the world .",,,
0, all of the indicators mentioned above have been adversely affect during the thirty year obsession with pushing the government back in the name of handing unfettered control over to big business and the vicissitudes of the market .,,,
0, nobody would deny the role that remarkable individuals have played in the major social changes of history .,,,
0," they have , however , ultimately required the actions of government .",,,

0," critically they have tended to be to the benefit of the weak , the vulnerable and the neglected .",,,
0," governments have been responsible for social reforms ranging from the abolition of slavery and child labor to the removal of conditions in factories and on farms that lead to injury and death , in addition to minimum wage regulations that meant that families could feed themselves .",,,
0," by contrast , the market was quite happy with cheap cotton sown by nimble young fingers .",,,
0," in turn profit was given preference over any notion of job security or the right to a family life , the market was quite happy to see water poisoned and the air polluted -- and in many cases is still happy with it .",,,

0," either way it costs the jobs of american citizens , pandering to racism and impoverishing workers at home and abroad .",,,
0," although the prophets of the market suggest that the only thing standing between the average american and a suburban home - with a pool , 4x4 and an overflowing college-fund is the government , the reality could not be further from the truth .",,,
0," the simple reality of the market is this : the profit motive that drives the system is the difference between the price of labor , plant and materials on one hand and the price that can be charged on the other .",,,

0, term limits allow leaders to enact their policies over a set time period and then usher them out of office .,,,
0," this is essential , because too much power in the hands of a single individual for too long can upset the balance of power in a country and shift power in favour of the executive , thus damaging the protections to society that checks provide .",,,
0," this is exactly what happened in the united kingdom under tony blair where from the start cabinet government virtually disappeared former cabinet secretary lord butler said `` in the eight months i was cabinet secretary when tony blair was prime minister , the only decision the cabinet took was about the millennium dome , '' and power continued to be ever more centralized in response to terrorism .",,,

0," without term limits the executive runs the risk of becoming a personal fief , rather than the office of first servant of the people , as it should be .",,,
0, this is seen particularly in parts of the developing world where leaders use state funds to generate electoral support from key groups and to maintain the loyalty of essential supporters .,,,
0, a current example of this is in venezuela where hugo chavez has been able to monopolize power to the point where it is unclear who his successor would be should he die suddenly .,,,
0, term limits serve to limit the ability of individuals to enact self-aggrandizing policies and to retain power indefinitely .,,,
0," instead , by maintaining term limits , leaders have only a limited time in power , which tends to shift their focus toward genuinely benefiting the public .",,,
0, incumbency provides a huge election advantage .,,,
0," leaders and politicians generally , almost always win re-election .",,,
0," such has been the case in the united states , for example , where presidents are almost always re-elected for a second term .",,,
0, leaders are re-elected because they have better name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby groups .,,,
0," people have a tendency to vote for those who they recognize , and firms tend to support past winners who will likely continue to benefit their interests .",,,
0, this problem has become particularly serious in developing world in which revolutionary leaders from the original independence movements are still politically active .,,,
0," these leaders often command huge followings and mass loyalty , which they use to maintain power in spite of poor decisions and corruption in many cases .",,,
0, such has been the case in zimbabwe with robert mugabe winning presidential elections in spite of mass corruption and mismanagement .,,,
0," only recently have the people finally voted against him , but it was too late , as his power had become too entrenched to unseat him .",,,
0, the uphill battle that will always exist to unseat incumbents makes term limits necessary .,,,
0, countries need new ideas and new leaders to enact them .,,,
0, old leaders using election machines to retain power do their country a disservice .,,,
0, power is best used when it changes hands over time in order allow for dynamic new solutions to be mooted in a changing world .,,,
0, a focus of a leader who is looking toward the next election is on getting votes .,,,
0," it is often the case that hard decisions need to be made by leaders , but it is difficult for them to do so when they are concerned with being re-elected .",,,
0, a leader has an incentive to put tough decisions off if he can retain power by doing so .,,,
0," when constrained by term limits , leaders must make the most of their limited time in office , resulting in greater prioritization of difficult decisions and reform .",,,
0," furthermore , the need to constantly fight elections places leaders in the pocket of lobby-groups and election supporters to a greater degree , as they will always need to go back to them for support , and thus can not make decisions that are in the national interest alone .",,,
0," while there will always be some of this behaviour , it is curtailed by term limits , as leaders in their final term will not be beholden to as many special interests as they can not run again .",,,
0," furthermore , leaders who develop strong party structures can influence the choice of their successor , ensuring that they have a legacy .",,,
0," in this way term limits encourage the development of party-based systems , rather than personality based systems of government .",,,
1,in october it was revealed that the united states’ national security agency had bugged german chancellor angela merkel’s telephone calls and had been spying on her since– long before she became chancellor in 2005.,,,
1," although the suggestion was first reported in the newspaper der spiegel it was taken seriously enough that the bnd, germany’s federal intelligence service, investigated and they too came to the conclusion that the german chancellor had been bugged by the nsa.",,,

1," she made it clear that, if the indications prove to be correct, she unequivocally disapproves of such practices, and considers them totally unacceptable.",,,

1,merkel is not the only world leader that has been spied upon by the nsa; the agency spied on at leastleaders.,,,
1," however she is the most prominent, as well as being an americophile and the head of a country that is a prominent us ally; it might be expected that the us would be attempting to bug the phone of a rival’s leader such as putin’s but not a close ally.",,,
1,despite the statements of outrage as the spying was revealed merkel would prefer to resolve the situation quietly through diplomacy but there has been little progress in talks and it may not be entirely here decision to make.,,,
1," the german federal prosecutor, harald range, says that he has sufficient evidence to launch an investigation into the surveillance of the chancellor’s phone.",,,
1," whether there is a prosecution is mostly up to the prosecutor; the justice minister can block an investigation but it is very rare, and in this case would be controversial.",,,
0, monitoring communications in germany 's capital -- including the communications of government leaders like merkel would be illegal under german law .,,,

0, when an act is illegal the state has a moral responsibility to prosecute that act .,,,
0, it should not be ok for another state to break the law simply because it is an ally and there is a desire to keep relations cordial .,,,
0, the german government has been working towards a ` no-spy agreement ' with the united states .,,,

1,on thursdayseptemberpeople in scotland will vote on the question 'should scotland be an independent country'.,,,
1," what scotland's relationship with europe will be in one, five or ten years after the referendum is unclear.",,,
1,            a scot voting no (to remain in the uk) could not be sure that scotland will be in the eu in a decade because of the possibility of a uk referendum on leaving the eu.,,,
1, in januarythe coalition government passed a bill that implemented a 'referendum lock' which would require a uk referendum on the eu if there were any major treaty changes.,,,
1, this lock is currently the only legislation for a referendum.,,,
1," however, in januarydavid cameron promised an in/out eu referendum by the end ofif he won the next general election.",,,
1," despite this commitment tory eurosceptics regretted the lack of an eu referendum in the queen's speech and so put forward their own referendum bill which is going through the commons to guarantee a vote, at the time of writing it looks likely to pass (and then get savaged in the house of lords which however cant stop the commons passing it).",,,
1, therefore a referendum on staying in or leaving the eu looks likely within the next five years or so.,,,
1,            a scot voting yes (to create an independent scotland) would be equally unsure of the implications of their choice.,,,
1," scotland's relationship with the eu in the event of independence is a hotly contested issue which the subject of the debate, the eu itself, has done little to clarify.",,,
1, nothing in the eu treaties deals with what would happen should a region within the eu become independent.,,,
1, whether scotland is regarded as a continuing state or a new state affects whether it would remain in the eu or would have to apply for membership.,,,
1, the commission has implied it would have to apply for membership and this raises the possibility that scotland would at least temporarily leave the eu following independence.,,,
1,"            certainly there would be much more clarity to a vote on scottish independence if scottish voters knew whether they were voting to remain part of a uk within the eu or one that would not be, rather than voting not knowing if they would be ejected from the eu against their will a few years down the line.",,,
1, this argument has been made by those in favour of an early eu referendum but is now certain not to happen.,,,
0," the scottish national party , snp , has said that they would not hold an eu referendum in an independent scotland .",,,
0, scotland is interestingly should scotland become independent and accede to the eu there would have to be a treaty change to provide for scottish representation in eu institutions .,,,
0," this could well trigger an eu referendum in the remainder of the uk , ruk , under the ` referendum lock ' .",,,
0, according to a februaryipsos-mori poll scots want an eu referendum but% would vote to stay in the eu and only% would vote to leave .,,,
0, indeed if scotland became independent those who wanted it to be in the eu rose to% and the number who wanted out fell to% .,,,
0," in england% would vote to leave , as of november, and% would vote to stay in .",,,
0, the uk independence party whose principal policy platform is a desire to leave the eu has performed considerably worse in scotland than in england .,,,
0, in thegeneral election ukip received 3.1 % of the vote whereas in the scottish election the next year they only received 0.9 % of the vote .,,,
0," similarly in theeuropean parliament elections ukip came second nationally receiving almost 2.5 million votes , 16.5 % of all votes cast but in scotland it came 6th , beaten by all four main parties and the greens receiving only 5.2 % of the vote .",,,
0, scots clearly believe their interests lie with europe and it would be better for scotland not to be tied to a country where sentiment is considerably more negative towards the eu .,,,
0," states are often seen as having one single unitary interest , however this is not the case the interests of different regions can be very different .",,,
0, it should therefore not be surprising that scotland and ruk have different interests with relation to the eu .,,,
0, for example on climate change scotland has the greatest potential for the generation of renewable energy in europe with% of europe 's tidal potential and% of wave potential yet the uk is in favour of scrapping european targets for the generation of renewable energy .,,,
0, uk ministers have also been accused of `` working against scotland '' on agriculture being willing to accept reductions in farm support meaning that scotland receives the lowest level in europe .,,,
0, scotland 's own interests would therefore be better represented by having its own government at the negotiating table than a uk government .,,,
1,"terrorism, according to wikipedia, is, broadly speaking, “those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for a religious, political or ideological goal, and deliberately target or disregard the safety of civilians or non-combatants”.",,,
1," there is some debate as to whether or not we can distinguish between terrorism and freedom fighters but for the purposes of this debate when we refer to terrorists we refer to groups such as al-qaeda, al-shabaab, hamas, hezbollah, the irish republican army, taliban and other such organisations that are generally recognised as terrorist.",,,
1, compensation refers to a monetary payment given to the individual who are wither direct victims of a terrorist attacks or else to family members who suffer as a result of the death of a loved one.,,,
1, it would be wise as a proposition to begin the debate by stipulating that this would only be possible where it is clear who the perpetrators were and what their nationality was.,,,
1,there are two possible scenarios.,,,
1," either the terrorists have committed the atrocities in their own nation in which case there is less debate as we are far more inclined to believe that governments have certain duties towards their own citizens, or terrorists commit atrocities in countries other than their own, in which case there is a greater burden on the proposition to show why the state ought to be held responsible.",,,
1,so the questions to be answered in this debate are: are we justified in holding a state responsible for terrorist acts committed by its citizens?,,,
1, what will the consequences of this policy be?,,,
1,the un suggests: the more viable alternative [to the motion under debate] is to create an international fund for victims of terrorism.,,,
1, terrorism is a global phenomenon and we need a global solution to this menace so that the damage is mitigated to a certain extent.,,,
1, this view of setting up an international fund was even backed by the un since the government can’t pay every time.,,,
1, this fund was originally suggested to be providing financial support rather than compensation but could be easily adapted will serve better is a more viable alternative instead of calling on the government to pay up for acts of terror.,,,
1,this is one possible line that an opposition can take.,,,
1, it is also possible for the opposition to argue that the government of the victims should pay the compensation or that there should be no compensation at all.,,,
1, i will run the opposition line that the victim government should be paying compensation.,,,
0, the state must pay compensation for the terrorist attacks because they are indirectly responsible for them .,,,
0," it is the state 's duty to ensure that its citizens act within the law by providing deterrents , education and by preventing crimes through the use of intelligence .",,,
0," even if the terrorist atrocities do not take place within the state , they were most probably planned within the state or initiated by someone who lives in the state .",,,
0, this means that it was within the state 's power to have prevented the attack from taking place .,,,
0," just as we would expect a state to investigate and track down a drug syndicate , we expect the state to track down terrorist organisations and prevent their activities .",,,
0," in many cases , states are not only responsible in this manner but also in a more direct manner .",,,
0, this may involve a paramilitary group -- a group that acts like a military but whose affiliation with the state or whose existence is kept secret .,,,
0," it may involve the state supplying the terrorist group with weaponry , money or intelligence .",,,
0, in these cases the state should clearly be held liable for the atrocities committed .,,,
0," for example , iran supports hamas financially and also claims that it shares identical views on palestine with hamas .",,,
0, iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to keep supporting hamas until the collapse of israel .,,,
0, syrian president bashar assad as another example provides both funds and weaponry for hezbollah .,,,
0, making the state pay for the wrongs of its citizens is therefore not only just but sends the message that the international community recognises the states involvement and duty in this regard .,,,
0, this means that the state becomes responsible in the sense that it takes the blame .,,,
0, if states are expected to pay compensation in this way then they are incentivised to take action against terrorist organisations to prevent incurring this massive cost .,,,
0, they are more likely to put resources into investigating leads and to take a hard stance on terrorist activity .,,,
0, this will decrease the prevalence of terrorism or at least make more intelligence available .,,,
0, why would the expectations that a country should pay compensation be a strong enough motive to force nations to pay up ?,,,
0," if it becomes commonplace and therefore expected , nations who do not pay compensation will be viewed as supporting terrorism or perhaps be suspected of being in cahoots with the terrorists .",,,
0, this would be very harmful to the nation .,,,
0," for example , in the case of the lockerbie bombing , suspicion of libya 's involvement lead to sanctions and poor international relations for many years .",,,
0," libya ultimately felt it was better to pay $ 2.7 billion , $ 10million per person killed , than continue to face un sanctions .",,,
0," compensation can prevent more violence because the victims are less likely to seek revenge if they feel that a , they have been recognised as victims b , the perpetrators , at least someone representing the perpetrators , has suffered financially and so some justice has been done c , they are more satisfied with the outcome of events because they have received money .",,,
0, this is less important in scenarios such as the london train bombings and 9/11 where there is little chance of victims retaliating but it is important in conflicts that have revenge as a common theme .,,,
0," for example , the israel-palestine conflict involves a lot of retaliation resembling age-old family feuds .",,,
0," feuds are often prevented through the payment of blood money , in saudi arabia blood money rates are 100,000 riyals to compensate for the death of a muslim man .",,,
0, perhaps we could use similar compensation to prevent some of this retaliation by compensating victims in the case of terrorism victims .,,,
0," often when a terrorist attack occurs the victims feel anger not only towards the individual perpetrators or the terrorist organisation but towards the entire national , political , cultural or religious group they belong to .",,,
0," an example of this is the flood of anti-muslim , anti-arab sentiment that arose after the 9/11 attacks .",,,
0, this has a lot of negative consequences because it means that perfectly innocent people will suffer hate crimes and ostracization which in turns is likely to turn those people against the victims of the terrorist attack .,,,
0," this kind of disharmony lays the foundation for poor international relations , discrimination and particularly make it difficult for integration to occur such a when a muslim family moves to the us .",,,
0, when the state pays compensation for the terrorist attacks they are making a statement that they recognise terrorism to be wrong .,,,
0, when this happens victims begin to distinguish from the terrorist organisation and the rest of the people in their cultural or national group .,,,
0, this allows for greater cultural reconciliation .,,,
0, the times when reparations tend to be suggested are when there is a wound of sorts between two groups of people that needs to be healed in order for there to be closure and reconciliation .,,,
0, an example of this is after the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa when compensation was given to victims of apartheid .,,,
0," we would argue that terrorist attacks fit perfectly into this frame because terrorist attacks tend to be committed by one group with a particular political , religious or national identity against another group with a different political , religious or national identity .",,,
0, compensation plays a role in reconciling these two groups .,,,
0, this compensation is not purely to provide the victims with things they have lost e.g. if they have lost the breadwinner of their family money will help them and if their home was burnt down again money will help .,,,
0, compensation from one 's own government can fulfil this need .,,,
0, but compensation from another government acts not only to fill financial needs but to provide reconciliation and closure .,,,
1,some modern states grant politicians outright immunity from prosecution.,,,
1,"  in such countries, including albania, brazil and to a lesser degree france, politicians may not be subjected to criminal prosecution while they hold office.",,,
1,"  other nations, such as the united states, have mechanisms of de facto immunity for politicians, by granting the head of the executive the uncontrolled power to issue pardons, effectively making any member of their cabinet immune.",,,
1,"  many other nations give no such protections to the holders of political office, beyond protection from civil claims for remarks made while in parliament.",,,
1,the resolution is that politicians be granted a full and inviolate immunity from prosecution while serving.,,,
0,"  the premier reason that most states , even those that allow for the prosecution of politicians , abstain from prosecuting them while they hold office is that being a politician is a job that requires one 's undivided attention .",,,
0," especially for the holders of prominent national-level offices , writing legislation , responding to crises under one 's purview , consulting one 's constituents , and engaging in campaign work often lead to politicians working an upwards ofhour day , every day .",,,
0, to expect politicians cope with all of these concerns will simultaneously constructing a defense against pending charges would be to abandon all hope of them serving their constituents effectively .,,,
0, we are rightly aggravated when politicians take extensive vacations or other extracurricular forays .,,,
0," being under indictment not only consumes even more of a politician 's time ; the stress it causes will inevitably seep into what remaining time they do allocating to fulfilling their duties , further hindering their performance .",,,
0," the impeachment proceedings for bill clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice were so intensive that they took tremendous resources away from not only the president himself , but all branches of the federal government for several months , amidst serious domestic and foreign policy concerns such as the ongoing war in kosovo .",,,
0," by the most popular definition , a state is the entity with the monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a defined territory .",,,
0," politicians , as the government of that state , necessarily wield the institutions of that state force .",,,
0, this results in the tremendous responsibility of deciding when the overwhelming power of the state is exercised .,,,
0," this pertains to a variety of areas , such as police action against civil unrest , the interrogation of both alleged and convicted terrorists , and economic policies that subsidize industries with state resources .",,,
0," while it is certainly possible to brazenly abuse this power , in many cases politicians are presented with options which are , if at all illegal , marginally so , and made with the good faith interest of the nation at heart .",,,
0, there are even conceivable situations in which a politician may exercise options that are clearly illegal but serve an overwhelming state interest ; consider an illegal raid on a private building in order to prevent a nuclear bomb from going off .,,,
0," while documented instances of policy-makers choosing not to act for a particular reason are rare , several senior cia officials stated that they had become risk averse merely because the idea of prosecuting officials who made security policy had entered the public discourse .",,,
0," we ought to place politicians in a situation where the only factor in their decision-making process is what serves the public interest , rather than having to weigh what they consider to be the right action against the chance it will lead to their incarceration .",,,
0," attempting to avoid this through a limited system which allowed for the prosecution of apolitical crimes but immunity for political decisions would fail to accomplish the goals of prosecution of politicians , which is primarily to protect against political abuses of state power which threaten the rights of the citizenry .",,,
0, the obvious benefit to prosecuting politicians is that it punishes -- and thereby deters -- corruption by politicians .,,,
0," however , this benefit can be achieved through other means .",,,
0," firstly , many western liberal democracies have one form or another of removing a politician from office in the midst of their term , such as impeachment in the american system or a vote of no confidence against the government in the westminster system .",,,
0," while defenders of immunity oppose impeachment as contrary to the principles outlined above , because of the effect that it may have on political duties , this is an option that remains in cases of gross misconduct .",,,
0," if the political will can not be mobilized to remove a sitting politician , they are held accountable by the electorate to whom they must answer in the next election , and who will likely punish blatant misuse of political power .",,,
0," even if the individual politician has reached a limit on their term of office , or does not seek reelection , they are still held in check by the damage that will be done to their party in the event of major misconduct on their part .",,,
0," finally , most politicians are significantly concerned about their legacy , which is tarnished significantly by corruption even if they are never held legally accountable for it .",,,
0," while nixon received a full pardon from his success , his name has become synonymous with criminality and scandal : a fate most politicians wish to avoid .",,,
0, it does tremendous damage to the public perception of a given political position to see the holder of that position on trial for criminal acts .,,,
0," politicians are important role models for the populace at large , and shining light on everyone one of their misdeeds is not conducive to them playing such a role .",,,
0," this hurts the ability of their successors who , though completely innocent , are stepping into an institution now tainted with the image of corruption or scandal .",,,
0," finally , the very process of prosecution can be damaging to the country , as citizens on opposing sides of the political spectrum disagree over the legitimacy of charges .",,,
0, these effects all deal real damage to the political institutions necessary for the functioning of the state .,,,
0," as noted above , the political life is steeped in difficult decisions , and some of these are bound to result in choices that are at least potentially illegal .",,,
0, the ability to prosecute politicians incentivizes political opponents to search out past actions by said politicians so as to immobilize them politically .,,,
0," such prosecutions are therefore not motivated by concern for justice , nor are they conducive to a well-functioning , multipartisan political system wherein representatives seek to work together to achieve their political ends .",,,

1,  with the republicans having regained control of the senate inthe question has arisen again in respect of thepresidential election.,,,
1, the debate regarding divided government vs. one-party rule is framed by some of the following questions.,,,
1, does divided government create a necessary check on government and the excesses of one political party or another?,,,
1, can presidents of one political party more effectively constrain the actions of their own party?,,,
1, does the supreme court provide a sufficient check on one-party rule?,,,

1, does divided government constrain corruption?,,,
1, what does history demonstrate?,,,
1, have divided or one-party governments been more successful?,,,
0, what do voters prefer?,,,
0,"by having both parties in charge of different parts of the government , there can be a greater degree of scrutiny over policy as the opposition party will force the president to justify his policies .",,,
0," under single-party rule , there is a risk of a president being able to push through his/her agenda with little oversight from a legislative branch that is largely in agreement with the policy .",,,
0, one need only look to authoritarian governments the world over to see that governments with too much power are likely to abuse that power .,,,
0," divided government provides a check on the executive , preventing agendas to be pushed through , allowing for compromise to be made between the two major parties , ensuring that the best possible policy for americans is enacted .",,,
0, as benjamin franklin wrote `` it is not enough that your legislature should be numerous ; it should also be divided . '',,,
0," the constitution of the united states is designed to prevent power from being concentrated in one place , with each of the three branches , executive , legislative and judicial , placing checks and balances upon each other .",,,
0," as james madison wrote `` it is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers , but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part . ''",,,
0," this principle ensures that power is divided , facilitating greater dialogue between the branches and between the two houses of congress which seeks to compromise with each other to provide the best possible expression of congress ' will .",,,
0," such a need for compromise between the branches lends itself to having control of the two elected branches being spilt between two parties necessitating compromise as opposed to single party control of both houses , where compromise can be pre-arranged to fit the aims of the executive .",,,
0," therefore , divided government is an extra requirement to government , ensuring that powers are not concentrated to the detriment of americans .",,,
0," congress is a bicameral body , with its constituent parts , the house of representatives and senate , working largely independent of each other to create bills .",,,
0, however necessary for both the house and senate to pass laws in identical form in order for it to become law .,,,
0, a period of ` reconciliation ' is usually required to find a compromise between two different versions of the same bill in order to maintain and improve what is best about proposed reforms and eliminate flaws before it becomes law .,,,
0," this independence between the two chambers , with reconciliation being one of the few areas where the two meet can allow for division in congress between the two major parties .",,,
0," indeed this can be seen as beneficial , as the broadest ideological range will be considered when making a policy work by reconciling two bills , making sure that centrist policy is enacted , preventing an ideological swing against the wishes of the people .",,,
0," divided government creates an imperative for compromise , encouraging the parties to work together for the best outcomes .",,,
0," this can help to undermine the more visceral aspects of debate , with the contest for election being left behind in order to focus on governing for the good of all americans .",,,
0, as a result the greatest american achievements have come when there has been broad bipartisan consensus .,,,
0, there is also a partisan consideration to seeking divided government .,,,
0," the more successful two-term presidents of recent times , ronald reagan and bill clinton , governed with congress partly or completely controlled by the opposition party .",,,

1,the relationship between the media and democracy is controversial.,,,
1," the media always claim they just “inform the public” whilst critics claim they actually shape public opinion, thereby “controlling” democracy.",,,
1, one possible way in which this happens is through opinion polls.,,,
1," in an opinion poll, an organization, such as a political party, a research company or a media company, questions a representative panel of citizens (usually about 1000) about their opinions on a political subject or about candidates.",,,
1," very often polls ask people how they would vote if there were an election today, and the media uses the results to project the share of the national vote that different parties would achieve.",,,
1," such polls are very common in the period of an election campaign, when five or more different surveys may be published in a week, and the results are picked over in detail by political commentators.",,,
1,different countries take different attitudes to the role of opinion polls in a democracy.,,,
1," many impose no limitations on the publication of polls in the media, but some, including france, south korea, mexico and taiwan, ban the publication of opinion polls in the days running up to a national election.",,,
1," in france, for example, the media cannot publish opinion polls of voting intention in the week before each round of national voting.",,,
1, the issue of opinion polls is particularly controversial in india where the election commission used to ban the publication of opinion polls in the days before and during national elections which are conducted over a period of some twenty days in five regional days of voting.,,,
1," in 1999, the indian supreme court overturned this rule following a challenge brought by a newspaper.",,,
1," however, today the main political parties have joined with the election commission in an attempt to reintroduce the ban.",,,
1, a similar situation exists in canada where restrictions on the publication of opinion polls were overturned in its supreme court in 1998.,,,
1,"it might be useful to focus the debate by determining what type of opinion polls are harming the democratic process: opinion polls about general subjects, polls projecting the outcome of elections before election-day, or exit-polls (which ask actual voters how they have cast their ballot) on election-day.",,,

1,"   likewise, the debate could occur primarily at the value level addressing the general influence of opinion polls on the democratic process.",,,
1,   the democratic process could include a variety of ways that citizens participate or are informed prior to the selection of policies and candidates.,,,
1,"  in particular, harm to the democratic process should be addressed with some specificity if it is argued that harm occurs.",,,
1,"  with the proliferation of public messages and the increased use of various media to carry those messages, the relationship of public opinion polls to democratic dialogue challenges the exploration of voter choices and the information on which those choices are made.",,,
0, in democratic nations public opinion matters as it is the public who ultimately decides who wins office and opinion polls measure that opinion .,,,
0, as a result politicians have become obsessed with the shifting whims of public opinion upon which the media focuses forcing politicians also focus on popular opinion even between elections .,,,
0," since the media carries the news , the active use of opinion polls by the media drives the policy agenda .",,,
0, lack of information on critical issues is likely to result as politicians focus only on areas where the opinion polls highlight .,,,
0, democracy is also harmed by the publication of opinion polls as subsequent citizen voter behaviour can be influenced .,,,
0," when , for example , an opinion poll portrays a huge majority for a certain subject , or for a particular party , its opponents might be less vocal since they feel `` outnumbered '' or that decisions have already been made thus diminishing democratic dialogue .",,,
0, undecided voters may be apathetic toward the election process since they appear to be a foregone conclusion .,,,
0, the potential influence on voters choices is the reason the france forbids opinion polls shortly before an election .,,,
0," since opinion polls are the products of research , they can also be heavily manipulated by the organization performing or commissioning the poll in question .",,,
0," a bias can easily be created by selecting a certain target group , such as aap opinion poll which asked more democrats than republicans , or more usually through asking certain questions or phrasing them in a particular way .",,,
0, for example it has been found that americans are more likely to support spending for the ` poor ' than for ` welfare ' .,,,
0, this information can generate false information and untrue or exaggerated claims .,,,
0," even if the research is done with an objective mindset , the research technique or reporting method can skew the results .",,,
0," for example , the opinion polls seldom report the measure of uncertainty of the conclusions , by for example reporting standards deviations from means , sample size , etc, these measures are usually not published .",,,
0, reporting the results of opinion polls without further statistical information leads to more misinformation .,,,
0, one such example comes from the exit polls of theu.,,,
0,s. presidential election .,,,

0," for instance , in theu.",,,
0,k. elections all polls predicted a labour victory .,,,
0," however , against all expectations , the conservatives won .",,,

0," or decided to vote for their first preference minor party , such as the liberal democrats , because they believed the conservatives would be voted out without their needing to cast their votes tactically for labour .",,,
0," thus , it is possible that the voters did n't accomplish the government they actually wanted , as they cast votes based on opinion polls .",,,
0, the unintended outcomes are a result of these opinion polls and tactical voting .,,,
0, this would ensure a more democratic discussion immediately prior to the decision making process of voting .,,,
0, this does not harm free expression because it is serving a specific purpose at a specific time .,,,
0," for instance , during times of national security or disaster certain citizen behaviour is restricted .",,,
0," since there is information on public opinion in all of the other weeks of the year , this two week moratorium would solve some of the harms of published opinion polls .",,,
0," there would be less stifling of discussion , voters would not be subjected to possibly biased information or misused statistics at this critical time of thinking and making a wise choice .",,,
0," tactical voting is likely to be used less , and minority voices are not as likely to be overshadowed by popularly `` claimed '' opinions .",,,
0," therefore , we propose that opinion polls not be publishedweeks prior to an election .",,,
0," when opinion polls become the constant focus of the media , politicians are forced to pander to an ever-changing public marketplace instead of developing a consistent party or personal philosophy .",,,
0, candidates become overly involved in defending and explaining poll data .,,,
0, voters become the consumers of political marketing .,,,
0, the democratic process is diminished when changing opinion polls interrupts substantive dialogue .,,,
0," without the excessive use of poll data , a candidate 's message can be more than an advertisement .",,,
0," rather than the marketing of a person , important political ideas and public policy discussion occur .",,,
0," even though poll data would be available during the earlier election season , a plan to control opinion polls would begin to diminish such a focus .",,,

1,“we do not negotiate with terrorists.”,,,
1," this is something we regularly hear, both in movies, and from governments.",,,
1," in the hostage situation the gas field at amenas in january 2013, algeria communication minister mohamed said repeated algeria’s determination “we say that in the face of terrorism, yesterday as today as tomorrow, there will be no negotiation, no blackmail, no respite in the struggle against terrorism”.",,,
1," algeria’s determination was in part due to its long history of terrorism in the country including a civil war fromtoin which up to 200,000 died against islamist groups such as the islamic salvation front (who had won an election).",,,
1," the war was a guerrilla campaign and there were numerous massacres on both sides, not something that encourages a moderate attitude.",,,
1," yet part of the reasoning may also have been that the terrorists in question were only threatening western hostages, they had said they only wanted the christians and infidels so the algerians in the gas complex were safe – possibly not the best way to coerce the algerian government.",,,
1,so what is a terrorist?,,,
1," while there is no comprehensive definition that is recognised by everyone the united states defines international terrorism as activities that“(a) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the united states or of any state;(b) appear to be intended—(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and(c) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum;”c can be ignored as the question of whether to negotiate applies equally to domestic as international terrorism.",,,
1," from the definition however the size of the attack does not matter, it can range from a stabbing in woolwich to the attack on the two towers or bigger.",,,
1,the key point of the definition is that the terrorists want something from the government and are using violent means to get it.,,,
1, this means that there is clearly something that could be the subject of negotiation.,,,
1, often the demands are not proportionate or the government is not in a position to answer the demands.,,,
1," in the algerian example mentioned above the demands included an end to the french action in mali, something that the algerian government has no power over and would an immense demand if negotiating with the french government.",,,
1," the other demands by the hostage takers was the release of islamists from algerian prisons and a safe corridor to the malian border, both are much more achievable by the algerians even if unpalatable.",,,
1, this then could have been the basis of a negotiation.,,,
0," almost all terrorist groups kill people , whether innocents or members of the military .",,,
0, even those who limit casualties by giving warnings of their atrocities are unperturbed when they do end up taking lives .,,,
0, negotiation can then be the best way to save lives both in the short and long term .,,,
0," in the short term negotiating can mean a cease fire , and if there are hostages their release .",,,
0, over the long term negotiation is necessary if there is to be any peaceful conclusion to the conflict .,,,
0," as the right to life is the most fundamental right , and the duty of the states to protect its citizens is primary role of the state it is clear that the protection of these lives should be the main consideration for the state .",,,
0, when fighting terrorists the state either needs to answer some of the terrorists demands or fight back .,,,
0," when the state fights back the by the terrorists response is almost always more bloodshed using more and more extreme methods for example the first intifada was fought using sticks and stones , but when this , and the peace process that followed it failed , or rather did not show the results that was hoped for , the second was a major step up to suicide bombing .",,,
0, this is because when the terrorists fail they are unlikely to pack up ; instead they will try to find a bigger lever to course the state into making the move they want .,,,
0, in this case arafat hoped a round of violence would bring about concessions .,,,
0," the best way to prevent this cycle of violence is to negotiate , even if this is mostly to buy time .",,,
0, even when there is no cease fire there will be no reason for the terrorists to escalate if their demands are being taken seriously .,,,
0," in every terrorist movement there are different factions and disagreements about how best to achieve their collective aims , and often terrorist groups have either direct or indirect ties with political parties with whom they share the same goals .",,,
0, it is clearly then in the interest of the state to strengthen the more acceptable parts of the movement whether can seriously talk to .,,,
0, the only way to strengthen the moderates is to negotiate .,,,
0, this then makes their path to a solution the more credible course for the movement as a whole to take .,,,
0, to demonstrate a negative example the united states and israel were unwilling to negotiate with moderates within the plo for fifteen years during which time not only was there a lot more bloodshed but much more radical groups formed on the palestinian side making negotiations much more complicated in the long run as there would be multiple groups who would need to sign up to a final peace treaty .,,,
0, un secretary general kofi annan stated in`` terrorism will only be defeated if we act to solve the political disputes and long-standing conflicts which generate support for it .,,,
0," if we do not , we shall find ourselves acting as a recruiting sergeant for the very terrorists we seek to suppress . ''",,,
0," terrorist campaigns do n't just come out of nowhere , with the exception of some single individual acts , there is a grievance behind the acts .",,,
0, the terrorist is trying to have this grievance dealt with and believes the best way to this end is through violence .,,,
0, it is clear that the easiest way to end the conflict is simply to resolve the grievance .,,,
0," even when there are no negotiations the state will usually attempt to resolve some of these grievances , however doing so unilaterally will simply show that the terrorist 's violence is working without getting any guarantees of an end to the violence in return .",,,
0, negotiation therefore benefits both sides .,,,
0, it is notable that% of terrorist groups that have ended sincehave done so as a result of negotiations compared to only% being defeated militarily .,,,
0, just as negotiations strengthen the moderates they isolate those who are most radical and interested in a violent solution .,,,
0, this isolation is key to actually winning a fight against groups using terrorist methods because terrorists are almost always hiding within the community .,,,
0," the only way to prevent these acts is therefore to encourage their community to persuade the terrorists to reject violence , or if they are not willing to change to aid the state .",,,
0, the need for help from the community is recognised in almost all conflicts against terrorist groups and insurgencies .,,,
0," the state succeeds when it gets the moderates on board , this is shown by the conflict in iraq where the united states turned the tide against al qaeda in the al-anbar awakening .",,,
0," this victory was only made possible through the engagement and cooperation with local leaders who wanted an end to violence so were willing to talk to , and join with the us military if the result was likely to be security .",,,
1,"the united states initiated military operations in libya in early march of 2011, with a broad international coalition under nato command, in order to defend civilians engaging in a popular revolution against muammar gadaffi.",,,
1," the brutal suppression and murder of these civilians by gadaffi's regime led to calls by the arab league for nato action as well as un resolution 1973, which authorized the limited mission of protecting libyan civilians with a no-fly zone.",,,
1, the us and nato attempted to execute this mandate by bombing select pro-qaddafi forces and munitions and maintaining air superiority over the country.,,,
1, the us formally transferred command of these operations to nato on april 1st.,,,
1, the conflict continued apace through june.,,,
1," during this period, it became clear that the us and nato mission had extended beyond simply protecting civilians to regime change.",,,
1, this has included the active military support of anti-gadaffi forces as well as targeted bombing campaigns.,,,
1, an international debate has followed these events.,,,
1," many in the us have claimed that president obama needed congressional approval afterdays of the conflict, in accordance with the war powers act.",,,
1," but the president has argued that this law, passed in the wake of the vietnam war, does not apply because us engagement does not rise to the level of ""hostilities"" contemplated by the law.",,,
1," other questions concern whether the war has extended beyond the un mandate and whether the engagement is even worthwhile for nato, the us, and the wider world.",,,
0, the pros and cons in this contentious debate are considered below.,,,
0,"there are multiple arguments indicating why the u.s. might be engaged in hostilities under the war powers act , enough so that this single argument could make an entire two person case .",,,
0, the u.s. has engaged in sustained hostilities in libya which have resulted in regime change within the country .,,,
0, the president himself admits that causing regime change would be unjustifiable in his speech justifying the war by pledging that `` broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake . '',,,
0," 2 however , regime change was the result of the mission and nato and u.s. played a significant role in facilitating that change .",,,
0," secondly , the war powers act covers the u.s. fighting in a supportive role in wars .",,,
0," `` for purposes of this chapter , the term ` introduction of united states armed forces ' includes the assignment of members of such armed forces to command , coordinate , participate in the movement of , or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged , or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will become engaged , in hostilities . ''",,,
0, 3 hence the u.s. is acting in violation of this condition .,,,
0," further , troops do not need to be on the ground to call the libyan engagement hostilities .",,,
0," u.s. men and women have firstly died in the conflict , but secondly if troops were needed on the ground for a war , a u.s. president could potentially fire a thousand missiles at a country without the engagement being considered a war .",,,
0," further , even though the u.s. gave powers to nato , it maintained a lead role in this coalition force .",,,
0," as such , the engagement should still be subject to u.s. laws and rules .",,,
0," finally , the sheer cost of the engagement to the u.s. taxpayer implies that it should be considered a war .",,,
0," the cost of the war has been more than $million per day .1 firstly , libya did not attack us soldiers and did not harm us citizens .",,,
0," given that this is true , then engagement with libya to begin with goes against the spirit of us law .",,,
0, given that the situation is not an emergency for the u.s. circumventing congress in order to prosecute the war is incredibly harmful as it undermines one of the core institutions in u.s. democracy .,,,
0," further , the use of international organisations such as the un and nato to circumvent congress has bad ramifications for the future as in doing this the u.s. government has significantly lowered the burden required to go to war should it wish to do so in the future .",,,
0, this is problematic because the decision to go to war should never be one that is taken lightly .,,,
0," should the u.s. wish to go to war again then it might end up in a situation such as vietnam , the conflict that inspired the creation of the war powers act .1 firstly , the un intervention in libya wrongly rests on nato authority .",,,
0, the use of nato to circumvent congressional approval in this situation violates the initial agreement regarding the participation of the u.s. in nato that was ratified by congress .,,,
0," as such , even if the u.s. is legitimate in going to war and the circumvention of war powers can be justified , the circumvention using nato can not .",,,
0," secondly , the use of un approval to circumvent congress means that the un charter and the ideals of the un have been placed by the government at a higher level of value than of the us constitution .",,,
0, if this is the case then the government has undermined the validity of the us constitution and through doing that has undermined all laws within the u.s. which is harmful should the u.s. wish to project power in a way that is contrary to the un 's wishes .1,,,
1,the european parliament is a directly elected body that covers all european union members.,,,

1,elections for the european parliament historically have low turnouts and it has been declining; inturnout was 61.99% but this had fallen to 43% in 2009.,,,
1, as the legitimacy of a parliament is based on a democratic mandate low turnouts damage the legitimacy of the european parliament.,,,
1," it is therefore right to explore possible ways of raising the turnout, both in terms of the number of registered electors voting and in terms of the total electorate.",,,
1, the main response from the parliament is to provide better information about what it does to voters and how it affects voters’ lives; something that is made possible by the increasing powers the parliament has.,,,
1, however the european parliament could think bigger and as such there have been calls for the eu to lower the voting age toin order to increase turnout as well as “improve intergenerational dialogue” and allow “young europeans… to have rights matching their duties”.,,,
0,   it is ridiculous and clearly unfair that some sixteen year olds should get to vote in an election while most are barred from participating .,,,
0, this is the case in european parliament elections at the moment ; young people in austria are able to vote in elections atwhile everyone else has to wait until they are eighteen .,,,
0, this means that a tiny minority of the youth in the european union get to vote before the rest something which is clearly discrimination against the majority of the european union 'sandyear olds ; ` universal suffrage ' should be universal for the european parliament across the whole of the union .,,,
0, the age should therefore be lowered to sixteen so that voting age is universally recognised with no one group receiving the right to vote before the others .,,,
0," the number of different elections can be confusing ; almost everyone has three , european , national , and local , and some have others added in such as mayoral , or regional elections .",,,
0, as such there is much to be gained from helping to differentiate elections by not being concerned about being allowed to vote for them all at the same age .,,,
0," having elections for the european parliament at the age ofwould clearly distinguish the elections from all the other elections within the country , with the exception of austria .",,,
0, for the european union this would be an opportunity to show that it cares for the youth vote and has their issues at heart as it is a chance to get teenagers involved in europe before they can be involved in their own national elections .,,,

0, the average age in the bundestag isand it is similar in most parliaments .,,,
0," youth unemployment in europe for the fourth quarter ofwas 23.2 % , almost twice the unemployment rate as a whole .",,,
0," this is because many countries do not implement youth friendly policies ; northern countries like germany are determined to impose austerity which increases unemployment , while southern countries when implementing reforms are not implementing labour reforms that would loosen the security of permanent workers in return for reducing unemployment .",,,
0, this may in part be a result of demographics in europe .,,,
0," europe is aging ; in19.3 % of the eu's population was underwhile 13.9 % over, bythis had changed to 15.6 % underand 17.5 % over.",,,

0, having elections atprovides an ideal opportunity as it means that most will participate in a european election while they are at school .,,,
0, teaching about why voting matters would also help to improve turnout .,,,
0, when austria reduced its voting age toit was found that turnout from 16-17 year olds was significantly higher than turnout for 18-19 year olds when both groups are first time voters .,,,
0, this suggests thatmay simply be the wrong time to introduce people to voting for the first time .,,,
0, since voting or not voting tends to be habit forming lowering the voting age could slowly increase turnout across the board .,,,
0, throughout the european union in the parliament elections there is a problem with protest voting .,,,
0, indeed studies have found that almost% of votes in european parliament elections are protest votes ; this is clearly bad for the european parliament as these are not the parties that the electorate really want when it comes to creating policy .,,,
0, it reflects the fact that voters do n't believe that their vote for the european parliament matters .,,,
0, yet because voting atis two years earlier than voting in most national elections voting for the european parliament will beandyear olds first experience of voting ; as they did not vote for the government they are much less likely to be using their vote simply as a protest against the national government .,,,
0, this is because it will be clear that they are not voting on the basis of national issues because they ca n't vote at that level .,,,
0, this then represents a good chance for parties to get their european policies across to the youngest voters so that they know what their vote at the european level means .,,,
1,"think tanks are a modern phenomenon, where high profiling intellectuals are given a free role to discover, investigate and solve important issues in order to affect public policy.",,,
1, the purpose of a think tank is to provide expert advice and ideas on economic or political problems; usually a think tank has a particular area of expertise and focuses their study on that area.,,,
1," their purpose is then not to propagate a political agenda but to look at facts, ideas, and possible new policies.",,,
1, in practice however this results in particular think tanks promoting policies that have a particular political orientation.,,,
1,despite the political leanings of some think tanks are often elevated to a status of impartial enlightenment and their voice has great impact on the paradigm and on public discourse.,,,
1," they publish academic material, hold seminars, and appear as authorities on particular areas in the media.",,,
1," however, lately, voices are being raised calling for their increased transparency on their sources of funding.",,,
1, of particular note the eu administration and anti-fraud commissioner siim kallas argued that as think tanks play a clear role in eu policymaking they should sign up to the european commission's voluntary lobbyists register.,,,
1," this would not require complete details of their funding but would require they “declare the interests, objectives or aims promoted and, where applicable, specify the clients or members whom they represent”.",,,
1,the model for think tanks disclosing their funders would require organisations to make public all contributions that constitute a significant portion of the organisations’ budget.,,,
1," this can take the form of a percentage, e.g. 1% of their budget.",,,
1, this would make them unable to receive anonymous donations over this sum.,,,
1, the major funders would then have to be disclosed along with any research they funded and would be on the think tank’s website.,,,
0, democracies rely on transparency .,,,
0, our commitment to transparency means surrendering part of our autonomy for the collective .,,,
0, this does not mean that our autonomy does not still belong to us ; the institutions that affect our lives are under a constant obligation to justify their decisions and existence in relation to us .,,,
0," i do not have a right to know everything about the local football club , if i do n't play football and they are not a public company their decisions do n't affect me .",,,
0," think tanks , however , are highly influential , and directly affect the society in which we live : some have , for example , lobbied successfully against action to prevent global warming .",,,
0," therefore they are to be considered a power in society , and the principle of transparency must be extended to them .",,,
0, think tanks are considered more credible than corporate marketing .,,,
0, in the case of corporate marketing the recipient is aware that he is being sold a product .,,,
0," in the case of think tanks , the recipient believes he is being given unbiased information .",,,
0," therefore , it is tempting for corporations to finance think tanks and encourage them to reach the conclusions that they otherwise would promote through marketing .",,,
0," this way , think tanks can be powerful tools for promoting a biased agenda : if done successfully the same message is communicated but in the form of credible information rather than manipulative marketing .",,,
0," in fact , it is common practice for journalists to quote think tanks without labelling their political bias .",,,
0, and they most certainly do n't say if there is funding from a particular interest for example with the supposedly free market institute of public affairs in australia that somehow ends up arguing for government investment and intervention in northern australia -- a position suspiciously close to several big mining companies .,,,
0," this violates people 's freedom to make an informed decision , and can give biased views disproportionate and undue influence .",,,
0," by forcing them to disclose , any corruption or bias will become obvious to all .",,,
0, non-disclosure can be perceived as objectivity .,,,
0, it is easier for the public to criticise a think tank that is openly associated with a particular funder .,,,
0, that kind of prejudice is stronger than the more general the prejudice against non-disclosure .,,,
0," a person might distrust a non-transparent think tank , but dislike a think tank that is funded by an organisation they are already prejudiced towards .",,,
0, in any comparison between two such organisations the distrusted organisation will have greater impact than the disliked organisation .,,,
0, this gives non-transparent think tanks an advantage over transparent and honest ones .,,,
0," billionaires are then able to buy influence by secretly funding organisations such as the global warming policy foundation or the institute of economic affairs that is then listened to , by the media and therefore the public , when their own views would simply be dismissed due to the personal motivations of the backers .",,,
0," by forcing all think tanks to reveal their funding , we level the playing field .",,,
0, even think tanks benefit from the introduction of this policy .,,,
0, the status quo leaves disclosure as a strategic device : think tanks are unwilling to disclose more than their competition for fear of being unfavourably portrayed .,,,
0," such negative competition , i.e. competition in factors that do not improve the products of the market , makes them unable to make rational decisions about their funding if , for instance , potential funders want to contribute only on the condition that this funding be made public .",,,
0," as a consequence , the advent of organisations who call for transparency has been praised by prominent think tanks like the new economics foundation .",,,
0," by depriving everybody of the strategic tool of revealing none or only a part of their funding , think tanks can not be pressured into hiding or providing certain information about their funders , and they can thus act more independently .",,,
0," in the status quo , the ability of think tanks to be non-transparent potentially provides a framework for criminal groups , or in extreme cases organisations , to handle large amounts of money without revealing where their money comes from or goes .",,,
0, we are allowing extremist groups to be exempt from answering to the government or shareholders in their management of money or information .,,,
0," in the us and canada , think tanks are also exempt from tax .",,,
0," by this mechanism , false think tanks can be used , for example , to channel money from openly extremist groups that could otherwise not access those parts of the world .",,,
1,"elections are the lifeblood of all democracies; they are where the people have the chance to make their choice of government, often after years where their only real influence has been through protest and the media.",,,
1, yet not all countries that have elections are really democratic.,,,
1, elections have become close to universal with many countries that are ‘autocratic’ also having elections just like any democracy.,,,
1, these elections are often a sham in the sense that there is no real chance of there being a change in government as a result of the vote.,,,
1, thus we might consider there to be another criteria beyond simply holding elections that determines if a country is truly democratic; whether the elections they hold are ‘free and fair’.,,,
1,"in the declaration on free and fair elections the inter-parliamentary council set out numerous conditions for elections qualifying as free and fair including:“voting rightsparty rightsresponsibilities of states… to guarantee the rights and institutional framework for periodic and genuine, free and fair elections”there are many ways in which there may be elections within an autocratic setting.",,,
1, in a few cases the ‘democratic element’ is purely for show; qatar is from this year (2013) holding elections (currently suspended due to a handover of power) for its advisory council but as an advisory body it is clear the real power will remain with the emir.,,,
1, it is much more usual that the ruling party simply ensures that the opposition can never get enough seats to form a majority.,,,
1, this may be done in several different ways.,,,
1," in burma (myanmar) for example the national league for democracy faces a parliament where many of the seats are not contested in elections, in the house of representatives the ruling union solidarity and development party hasseats, of whichwere directly appointed.",,,
1, the main opposition the national league for democracy wonout of theseats it contested in byelections showing that it would likely win if there were an election without restrictions.,,,
1, alternatively as in zimbabwe there may be intimidation and violence in the elections themselves.,,,
1," or the results may be determined in advance through ballot stuffing, vote rigging, and bussing in supporters so they vote several times as occurs in russia.",,,
1, the methods may be different but the outcome is the same; certain victory for the ruling party.,,,
0, holding sham elections is fundamentally dishonest as it is asking the people to choose a government and then ignoring their choice .,,,
0, not holding elections is at least honestly telling the people that they get no say in who is in power .,,,
0," holding a sham election inevitably means having to lie to the people somewhere along the line ; whether it is in preventing people registering , or voting , or in manipulating the results .",,,
0, the people usually know the result is a sham or at least are suspicious -- in the latest zimbabwean election the headlines in the newspapers included `` zanu-pf gloats over victory '' .,,,
0, without a sham election the government can at least be honest with their people so enabling a level of trust or even a kind of contract between the two -- the government and the people each lets the other get on with it .,,,
0, thus for example in china trust in government inwas% against the world average of% .,,,
0," it is hard to see what the benefit of an election that can change nothing is , but there are certainly all the costs associated with a normal election .",,,
0," elections can be costly in financial terms , the united states elections cost several billion dollars but even much smaller and less extravagant elections need financing .",,,
0," zimbabwe 's elections inforced the government to ask its neighbours for $million to carry out the polls , for a nation that is essentially bankrupt this is a lot of money .",,,
0, another cost is uncertainty .,,,
0, in fully democratic elections the uncertainty is with what the policies will be when the government changes .,,,
0, with sham elections the uncertainty is whether the elections will be a focus for violence .,,,
0, sometimes this is during campaigning itself as with zimbabwe inwhere up topeople were killed .,,,
0, otherwise violence occurs when there is a perception that an election has been stolen so the green movement in iran took to the streets and was met with a violent crackdown in.,,,
0, democracy and elections are about popularity but popular decisions are not always the right ones .,,,
0, even mature democracies have sometimes seen their government 's make use of the levers of government to boost their electoral chances ; for example margaret thatcher 's government stoked the economy in the lawson boom inwhich just happened to be an election year .,,,
0, governments without elections can engage in long term planning and make unpopular decisions without fear of the consequences .,,,
0," thus for example saudi arabia is willing to pump less oil , and so get less money in the short term at least , in order to create stability in the oil market by having enough excess capacity to prevent price spikes .",,,
0, not having any elections -- or only elections for a powerless advisory parliament -- may actually have a benefit in putting responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the rulers .,,,
0," only a country that is comparatively well governed , or successful , can manage without a democratic safety valve .",,,
0, it is notable that the remaining absolute monarchies or those where the king rules as well as reigns are mostly very wealthy petro states .,,,
0," several of the remaining communist regimes , china and vietnam , rely on rapid economic growth to cement their legitimacy combined with meritocracy in their selection of leaders .",,,
0, in both cases there is an incentive for good governance by those in power as they are in for the long term .,,,
0, the leaders know they are not going to be elected out of office so have the motivation to reduce corruption and create long term growth through investment in infrastructure because this will benefit them in the future .,,,
1,conscription refers to the compulsory enrolment of citizens to national service.,,,
1, national service does not always include military service but traditionally revolves around the prospect or existence of a state of war.,,,
1," the object of conscription is to permit the mass recruitment of young men and women, in times of need, to come to the aid of the state.",,,
1," of the contemporary examples of conscription being used, the vietnam is perhaps most infamous for its popular images of american conscientious objectors burning their draft cards in objection to the war's justifications.",,,
1," conscription was subsequently abolished in the united states in 1973, but it remains in many states, such as finland and austria in the developed world and mexico and thailand in the developing world, as a bulwark against potential aggression.",,,
1," proponents also argue that conscription benefits the citizens enlisted, encouraging their patriotism and teaching them invaluable life skills.",,,
0," opponents respond that the lives of one's citizens cannot be used as property to use in times of war and that regardless, there are economic disincentives to conscription.",,,
0,national service helps to promote patriotism and a sense of nationhood .,,,
0," in many countries national pride is at an all-time low in the wake of recent the financial crash and resulting austerity budgets and this gives us the chance to rally around a shared cause , no matter what race or culture you come from .",,,
0, the individual has a duty to put something back into society and national service allows this .,,,
0," whether it be through protecting the country or helping with social or environmental projects , this encourages the idea of working as a community instead of merely for selfish ends .",,,
0," even when not in active service , the mere knowledge that one is trained and , at a moment 's notice , deployable to the front line in the protection of one 's society and way of life promotes a wonderful togetherness .",,,
0, an example of this is the irish in world war i. although they were only recruited as volunteers even nationalists signed up .,,,
0," a nationalist mp john redmond described it as ' a distinctively irish army , composed of irishmen , led by irishmen and trained at home in ireland ' ` the achievements of that irish army have covered ireland with glory before the world ' , this was in stark contrast to the disillusionment and risings nationalists back in ireland were participating in .",,,
0,"  a volunteer army , often separated from society at large and operating as a ` state within a state ' , does not serve such purposes so easily .",,,
0," in the military , young men acquire many skills for everyday life .",,,
0," these include personality traits like self-discipline , teamwork and leadership and practical skills like first aid , driving an ambulance , extra practice for surgeons , swimming , etc. that might be beneficial either to their own careers or , in cases of emergency , to everyone as these skills are transferable .",,,
0," as william james once wrote about national service , ` our gilded youths would be drafted off to get the childishness knocked out of them , and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas ' .",,,
0,  furthermore it acts as a test of manhood .,,,
0," as ann marlowe points out , ` if we showed all of our young people a closer look at danger , if we forced them into some form of self-testing , perhaps we would not only give them a sense of greater purpose , but also strip the false glamour from depictions of cruelty and destructruction .",,,
0,  we accept the need for national service in wartime and this is just an extension of this .,,,
0," conscription during peacetime would mean that the country was prepared for emergencies when they happened , rather than having to prepare after the fact .",,,
0," as us congressman charles rangel has argued , the fairest way of ensuring that all share in the sacrifice is a military draft , poutvaara & wagener  p..",,,
0,"  it would ensure that at the time of a military conflict the state has enough trained troops , therefore the security of that state is enhanced - a benefit every citizen can enjoy .",,,
0," the philosopher john rawls believed similarly , arguing ` conscription is permissible only if it is demanded for the defence of liberty itself ' , carter  p..",,,
0,"  furthermore , it also acts as a potential deterrent against aggressive action , for the existence of a large pool of well-trained reserves is in principle little different to the existence of a large , well-trained standing army .",,,

0," conscription permits the state to raise , both cheaply and quickly , a large , able-bodied force ready for combat .",,,
0, states with conscription-based armed services are able to prepare for combat without the expense of housing a large volunteer force .,,,
0," furthermore , in the context of surprise attacks , conscription permits the instantaneous raising of a large , competent army .",,,
0," a volunteer force faced with a sudden and extreme threat would not be able to raise , equip and prepare a sufficiently-powerful force within a similar time .",,,
0," in, when faced with the threat of an arab alliance led by general nasser , israel was reliant on the swift mobilization of its conscripts in order to first deter and then repel the arab forces .",,,
0," a volunteer force would likely have been slower to respond , less able to deter and incapable of repelling .",,,
0," without conscription , a state leaves itself at the mercy of an enemy able to conceal its intentions and strike rapidly .",,,
1,the united states initiated operation enduring freedom on the 7th octoberless than a month after the attack on the world trade center and pentagon.,,,
1," the taliban had been sheltering osama bin laden, the mastermind of those attacks, and refused to extradite him.",,,
1," the conflict was swift with kabul falling on the 13th november to the northern alliance, a group who had been fighting the taliban and had us help.",,,
1, bin laden however evaded the united states and escaped to pakistan but has since been killed.,,,
1,there was however a need to keep the peace and the international security assistance force was established in kabul ondecember 2001.,,,
1, nato took over command of isaf onaugustand its mission was expanded to include the whole country.,,,
1, unfortunately the united states and nato did not succeed in destroying the taliban who managed to regroup in pakistan and begin fighting again in afghanistan in 2003.,,,
1, losses for nato and us forces in afghanistan reached a peak ofinand so far there have been a total offatalities.,,,
1, casualty rates for civilians are of course many times higher with at leastsince 2005.,,,
1, nato however is now getting out; on the 18th june the control over military operations in afghanistan was handed over to the afghanis and on the same day the taliban indicated a willingness to negotiate indicating that perhaps an end is in sight.,,,
1, regardless of whether these negotiations go ahead nato intends to have mostly left the country by the end of 2014.,,,
1, so it is a good time to consider if nato has been successful.,,,
1,what constitutes success for nato in afghanistan?,,,
1, there are several different threads to what might be considered a success.,,,
1, the most obvious are whether there has been success in the objectives set by the united states at the outset of the conflict and whether nato has succeeded in the remit of its mission in afghanistan.,,,
1,george bush initially stated that us actions were “designed to disrupt the use of afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the taleban regime.”,,,
1, this is a very limited objective that could be said to have been rapidly met but it is not really the objective for having nato forces in afghanistan.,,,
1,annex i of the bonn agreement inthat established the international force in afghanistan recognised that “the responsibility for providing security and law and order throughout the country resides with the afghans themselves”.,,,
1, the nato force was to “assist in the maintenance of security for kabul and its surrounding areas” and was later expanded to the rest of the country through un security council resolutionin 2003.,,,
1, the only non-security element mentioned for the force was at the end “it would also be desirable if such a force were to assist in the rehabilitation of afghanistan’s infrastructure.”,,,
1,"but while it is clearly the most important element just limiting the question to security does ignore other justifications for nato’s mission that have at various times been given; to ensure human rights, to enable the growth of democracy, and rebuilding the country all of which should be at least considered.",,,
0, `` nato 's primary objective in afghanistan is to enable the afghan authorities to provide effective security across the country and ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists . '',,,
0, the invasion of afghanistan was initially about destroying al-qaeda and with the killing of osama bin laden inin pakistan this objective has been met .,,,
0, there are still efforts to destroy al qaeda but these have mostly moved out of afghanistan and into pakistan and other countries such as yemen .,,,
0, nato has also brought afghanistan to the point where the afghani 's can look after themselves and exercise their own security .,,,
0, on 18th june afghanistan took over the lead from nato on security nationwide having previously been taking control district by district .,,,
0," handing over security also itself improves security with afghanis in kandahar saying `` now that the foreigners are gone , the security situation in the city and in the districts is much better '' .",,,
0, nato is also ensuring that peace and security remain in afghanistan as they draw down by opening up negotiations with the taliban .,,,
0, peace can only be assured by bringing together the sides so that almost everyone accepts the status quo and does not want to destroy that status quo through force .,,,
0," united states officials say `` we have long said this conflict wo n't be won on the battlefield '' with the deputy national security advisor , ben rhodes , adding `` the united states will be supporting a process that is fundamentally afghan-led '' meaning that nato is no longer key to the process .",,,
0, nato handing over control to the afghans and eventually withdrawing entirely will make peace more likely to succeed as the taliban `` considerers it its religious and national duty to gain independence from the occupation '' with this goal it wants `` to support a political and peaceful solution '' .,,,
0, lasting peace is then only possible when nato leaves .,,,
0, some of the biggest benefits of the nato occupation have been through the increase in democracy and human rights .,,,
0, while these were not specific aims of the nato mission they were among the goals set out by the united nations .,,,
0," there have been two presidential elections , one inthe other in, and two parliamentary elections ,andnone have been perfect but it is a clear advance from no elections at all .",,,
0, the most notable human rights increase has been in women 's rights .,,,
0," under the taliban afghanistan strictly limited the activities of women but today 27.3 % of the representatives in the parliament are women , better than in the uk or us , and the first female governor is in office .",,,
0, the literacy rate is still low but they now make up 36.6 % of those in primary school up from almost nothing .,,,
0, there have been similar gains in other human rights such as a reduction in the use of corporal punishments such as amputating hands for theft .,,,
0, the ` rehabilitation ' of afghanistan 's infrastructure has not been an immense success due to the continuing bombing campaign which inevitably damages infrastructure but there have been big economic benefits from the nato presence .,,,
0," there have been more than 4,000 schools built and 175,000 teachers trained , although more is needed this is an immense boost to education in afghanistan .",,,
0," another benefit of increased stability is a renewal of outside investment , from china in particular .",,,
0," china has been investing billions , several mining firms have made a $ 4.4 billion investment in one project ; an immense undeveloped copper reserve in aynak .",,,
0," in total there is more than $billion being invested in infrastructure by afghanistan 's asian neighbours , as these investments are looking for profit they are clearly believed to be sustainable , by comparison the united states has only funded $ 1.6 billion since.",,,
1,"turkey is a democracy, or at least it is usually considered as such.",,,
1," it is the only middle eastern, and only country with a muslim majority, in nato, and it is a long term applicant to the european union.",,,
1, however its slow progress in that regard is perhaps an indication that its democracy is not quite as entrenched as many would like.,,,
1," turkey is a democratic, secular, and constitutional republic, but there are republicans who believe that all of these are threatened by the prime minister recep tayyip erdoğan and his justice and development party (akp) which have been in power for a decade.",,,
1," until now however concern has not turned into outright protest, and while other areas of the middle east underwent revolutionary convulsions turkey has remained high and dry often being seen, not least by turkey’s leaders, as a model for the new emerging democracies in other parts of the middle east.",,,
1,on the 28th maya small group of activists attempted to stop the clearance of trees for the redevelopment of a park in istanbul.,,,
1, the police response was heavy handed using tear gas resulting in growing protests around the park.,,,
1, attempts a few days later to evict these protestors resulted in injuries to several people; again the result is a surge in the protests rather than the unrest dying down.,,,
1, over the weekend the protests became much larger in scale centered on taksim square from which after a battle with demonstrators the police retreated.,,,
1," the protests spread across much of the country and according to the turkish doctors’ association the clashes with police have left 1,000 people injured in istanbul andin ankara.",,,
1,although the protests were sparked by development of a green space the driving force behind the protest is democracy and fears about the authoritarianism of the ruling party.,,,
1, protesters argue “he's [erdoğan] a dictator.,,,
1, whenever we want to say our beliefs he always says: 'no you can't speak.,,,
1, you are lying and you are very little.'”,,,
1," they link the destruction of the park with taking away public spaces and observers contend that ""erdogan does not listen to anyone any more, not even to members of his own party.”",,,
1," they believe the protests will force the prime minister to listen, others however say they won’t go away until he resigns.",,,
1,"erdoğan’s response has perhaps been predictable, heaping blame on the opposition and social media; “there is now a menace which is called twitter… the best examples of lies can be found there.",,,
1," to me, social media is the worst menace to society.”",,,
1, a clear parallel to the ‘arab spring’ in tunisia which some called a ‘twitter revolution’.,,,
1, however of course there are immense differences; even if it has its faults turkey is a democracy.,,,
1, erdoğan has won three terms as prime minister which shows his popularity.,,,
1, moreover the akp stays in power not because of the army – which is generally linked to the idea of a secular turkish state that erdoğan has undermined – as was the case in egypt but because of his popular support.,,,
1," attempts to get him to stand down as a result of protests, demonstrations, and violence might very well be considered to be anti-democratic.",,,
1,there is then a question about whether turkey is a democracy and perhaps about democracy itself.,,,
1, democracy can clearly be many different things.,,,
1, at its most basic it is rule by the majority of the people but we usually consider it to be broader.,,,
1," instead of just rule by the majority we consider democracy to be ‘liberal democracy’ which claus offe considers to have four basic elements; statehood – it must be within a defined territory with a functioning government in this case an effective and legitimate government, rule of law which limits the exercise of state power and provides personal rights to the people, political competition between contending parties that contest elections, and the rulers must be accountable not just through elections but also the media and other methods of removing the elite.",,,
1,  as the first definition is easily met even by a mob we will look at the second.,,,
0," the rule of law , limits on the power of the state , and the provision of personal rights are key to any country being considered to be a liberal democracy but these are being undermined in turkey .",,,
0, this is most noticeable when it comes to freedom of the press .,,,
0, turkey 's press freedoms have been in decline .,,,
0," it is a dismal 154th on the press freedom index and most notable is that it is the country with the most imprisoned journalists with at leastimprisoned , mostly without having been convicted and as a result of their work .",,,
0," the lack of freedom of the press and how cowed the press is has been shown in the recent rioting ; cnn covered the protests live , at the same time its turkish language subsidiary cnn turk was broadcasting a cooking show .",,,
0," turkey has been heading towards being a one party , even a one person , state .",,,
0, erdoğan is intending to change the constitution is an attempt to institutionalise this .,,,
0," his new presidency would have the power to issue decrees with force of law , dissolve parliament and call elections , and to command the military .",,,
0, the attempt to change to a presidential system is clearly a move to enable erdoğan to avoid the limit of three terms in much the same way as vladimir putin did by switching jobs .,,,
0, a presidential system is not bad in principle but it should not be simply used as a vehicle for a particular politician .,,,
0, moreover any change of such a magnitude in a democratic country should be done only with popular consent -- something that this change does not have .,,,
0, in a februarypoll 65.8 % of turks favoured keeping the parliamentary system and only 21.2 % were in favour of a change to a presidential system .,,,
0, under the akp turkey has effectively become a one party state ; this means that there is not the competition necessary to make turkey a genuine liberal democracy .,,,
0, yes alternative parties exist but this does not mean they are going to get any power any time soon if the government can help it .,,,
0, the akp has been able to get twice as many votes as its nearest rival making it by far the dominant party .,,,
0, the party consolidates power and there are signs that competition in the party is more important than with other parties .,,,
0, the rioting across the country has shown this in several ways .,,,
0, first the resort to violent and street protest shows the opposition do n't think they can oust the akp at the ballot box .,,,
0, secondly the response from the leaders of the akp have been mixed .,,,
0," while erdoğan has vehemently condemned the protests while president abdullah gül has taken a more nuanced line saying `` democracy is not just about elections '' and that `` if there are objections , there is nothing more natural than voicing them '' effectively endorsing some protest .",,,
0, the trigger for the rioting ; construction projects building over a park and a square are a good analogy for the government as a whole .,,,
0, the akp government does not care for public opinion and is happy to push through projects without reference to it .,,,
0, in the case of taksim square the government did not consult about plans to bulldoze the park despite it being the site of a massacre inmaking it a place of historical significance .,,,
0, a court ruling to stop construction was also ignored .,,,
0," it is the same with legislation , the controversial changes to alcohol laws were only proposed a month before they were passed and debate was limited to two days , while some important business particularly involving day to day running of foreign and defence has very little oversight .",,,
0, the akp is not just making turkey authoritarian it is making it an islamic authoritarian state .,,,
0, since aamendment to the constitution turkey has been a secular state .,,,
0, recently turkey rushed through restrictions on the sale of alcohol prohibiting sale overnight .,,,
0," more worryingly than minor restrictions is a decline in gender equality and respect for religious minorities ; in, the year the akp came to power turkey was ranked 63rd in the un 's gender empowerment measure , byit had dropped to 101st out ofcountries .",,,
0, without respect for these groups it is difficult to see how turkey can be considered a liberal democracy that provides for equal and personal rights .,,,
1,should women be allowed to serve in combat roles in the armed forces?,,,
1, combat roles are usually defined as “roles whose primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy”.,,,
1,"  examples are infantryman, tank crew member and combat pilot.",,,
1,the military roles open to women vary around the world.,,,
1," legislative changes in the past few decades have allowed women to serve in all military roles in many western countries (such as canada, new zealand, sweden, norway, ireland, denmark, germany, finland and the netherlands).",,,
1, most other western countries allow women to serve in a variety of roles but not in combat.,,,
1, examples are the u.s. (united states) and u.k. (united kingdom).,,,
1," nevertheless, the roles of women in the british and american militaries have been gradually increased.",,,
1, the rand corporation studied increased deployment of women in all three branches of the united states military throughout the 1990s.,,,
1," they wholeheartedly endorsed further integration, having found no great ill effects from expanding the roles of women in the different services over that period.",,,
1," in 2002, the british ministry of defense reviewed whether to open combat roles to women and decided against it, while the service of american women in iraq and afghanistan wars has led to a renewed debate about opening combat roles to women in the u.s. military.",,,
1,"during the twentieth century, equal opportunity laws have made it possible for women to work in many fields which were once exclusively male.",,,
1," in many western countries, the military is now one of the very few parts of society to formally discriminate against women.",,,
1," meanwhile, the number and nature of conflicts in the world have changed over the past century.",,,
1,"since the end of the cold war, wars have become “less frequent and less deadly”.",,,
1," in the past, wars were often fought between large armies with heavy weaponry, but many modern conflicts are l.i.c.s (low intensity conflicts), involving terrorist groups with guerilla tactics.",,,
1," l.i.c. has been defined by the u.s. military as “... a political-military confrontation between contending states or groups below conventional war and above the routine, peaceful competition among states.",,,
1," it frequently involves protracted struggles of competing principles and ideologies... it is waged by a combination of means, employing political, economic, informational, and military instruments.”",,,
1, modern war has gained an intensity and geopolitical significance.,,,
1," terrorists’ threats prompt the invasion of countries, while struggles for democracy often attract allied intervention.",,,
1, an example is the n.a.t.o. (north atlantic treaty organization) involvement in the libyan civil war of 2011.,,,
1,"interventions by western allied groups have increased, while young people in these countries are used to educational and economic opportunities that have largely removed their incentives to enlist.",,,
1," since the cold war, most of these countries have ended conscription (with exceptions such as israel and russia), relying instead on a.v.f.s (all volunteer forces).",,,
1, both these developments place pressure on recruitment.,,,
0," militaries can use ` gender-blind ' recruitment and training processes , treating all candidates the same regardless of gender .",,,
0, this is% fair and some women will certainly succeed in entering combatant roles and will prove themselves the equal or better than the men .,,,
0," for example , several soviet women have distinguished themselves as snipers and combat aviators .",,,
0," alternatively , militaries can calibrate recruitment and training to suit female candidates .",,,
0," there is a precedent for this in the u.s. military 's a.p.f.t. , army physical fitness test , which has variations for age .",,,
0," if the test standards can be lowered for older men , they can also be lowered for women .",,,
0," in the modern high technology battlefield , technical expertise and decision-making skills are often more valuable than physical strength .",,,
0," for example , in the american army , performance targets are regularly calibrated for age and position .",,,
0," a forty year-old senior n.c.o. , non-commissioned officer , faces a much easier set of targets than hisyear-old subordinate , yet both are deployed in an active combat role .",,,
0," modern warfare involves many l.i.c.s , where the battleground is as much `` hearts and minds '' as it is physical combat .",,,
0, in a conflict where hearts and minds are important delicate handling of local people is required in order gain their support .,,,
0," in l.i.c.s , women are often better suited to intelligence gathering , medical assistance , policing and mediation than men .",,,
0, they are often perceived as less threatening and more understanding .,,,
0," in addition , they would be better placed to deal with women in the local population .",,,
0," for example , the job of many of the female u.s. marines killed and injured in junein iraq was to search women for explosives at checkpoints to avoid the near-universal sense of humiliation engendered by a member of the opposite sex conducting an intimate bodily search .",,,
0, volunteer military forces face low recruitment and retention rates as a result of it being a tough and stressful job where workers can not work for as long as they do in many civilian jobs .,,,
0, injuries and trauma caused by fighting also add to the turnover rate of soldiers .,,,
0, as a result it is necessary to widen the applicant pool in order to be able to ensure there are more candidates for the army .,,,
0, allowing women to serve in combat effectively doubles the possible talent pool available for the military to recruit for delicate and sensitive jobs which require interpersonal skills that not every soldier possesses .,,,
0, the result will be better and more diplomatic soldiers who will be particularly useful in l.i.c.s. many modern conflicts are l.i.c.s which involve terrorist groups using guerilla tactics .,,,
0," in these situations , there are no clear ` front-lines ' , and no clear difference between combatant and non-combatant roles .",,,
0, all women serving in the military are exposed to `` front-line risks '' .,,,
0, attacks on soldiers are as likely to occur on the military 's bases themselves as they are when the soldiers are out on patrol .,,,
0," for example , in late june ofin iraq , two women marines were killed and about a dozen injured in a pair of suicide attacks .",,,
0, that frontline combat operations are not always much more dangerous than other roles can be shown by the casualties in iraq comparing the initial invasion and reconstruction phases .,,,
0," the united states lost very few casualties in the invasion phase of the war up to president bush 's declaration of victory onmaywith onlydead , compared to an overall death toll of.",,,
0," if men and women are already in practice facing the same risks and as women and men are equal , there should be equality when it comes to being considered being in frontline combat service .",,,
0," there is a fundamental principle that men and women should be considered equal in all walks of life ; and as such should both have an equal role in the military , including being in combat .",,,
0, not allowing combat roles for women has an unfortunate side effect of increasing inequality in terms of ranks .,,,
0, combat duty is necessary or highly beneficial for promotion to senior officer positions in many armies .,,,
0," if women can not serve in combat , very few will ever reach the highest ranks of the military ; this creates a glass ceiling that will be very hard to break without this change to allowing women to serve in combat .",,,
0," women have to be given the same opportunities as men , in the army in order to have the same opportunities they have to be exposed to the same risks .",,,

1, even today women hold barely 20% of parliamentary positions1.,,,
1, governments and all the major political parties have been accused of merely 'window dressing' in their attitudes to female participation in politics.,,,

1, many people argue for a similar form of 'affirmative action' or 'positive discrimination' to boost female candidacy and attempt to ensure parliaments will reflect the gender balance of their electorate.,,,
1," this may be done either via targets (aiming to get a certain percentage of female candidates) or by quotas (requiring a certain number of women politicians), which are legally enforceable but inflexible.",,,

1," an innovative proposal in nunavat, canada, suggested two-member constituencies (one male representative, one female), but this was defeated in a referendum in 19974.",,,
1,david cameron has said that his party will impose all-women shortlists; he said he 'desperately' wanted to address the 'failure' of parliament and the conservative party to reflect society5.,,,

0," essentially, what the proposition is arguing for is equality of outcome; the opposition counters with equality of opportunity.",,,
0,at present there is a vicious circle whereby women see no point in standing for politics because it is viewed as a male-dominated institution .,,,
0, positive discrimination is the only way to encourage women to stand .,,,
0," only if one generation is pushed towards politics can there be role models for potential future women mps to follow ; for that reason it need not be a permanent measure , just one that gets the ball rolling1 .",,,
0," it has been proven by a study at the university of toronto , canada , that women need inspirational female role models more than men ; they need it to be demonstrated that it is possible to overcome barrier2 .",,,
0, positive discrimination would provide this evidence and support .,,,
0," this measure would simply allow women to overcome the institutional sexism in the selection committees of the established political parties , which has for so long prevented a representative number of women from becoming candidates , and would encourage other women to try and emulate that .",,,
0," it 's about changing stereotypes and perception , particularly of the concept ` leadership ' , which we automatically think of as a male trait1 .",,,
0, this will help achieve true progress in the future .,,,
0," whilst is it possible for men to speak on women 's issues , some topics of debate , e.g. on family issues or equality in the workplace , are still seen as less important than economics or foreign policy .",,,

1," in parliamentary democracies with smaller districts and shorter election cycles (or more irregular election cycles), the costs could be different and less significant.",,,
1,"campaign finance reform (cfr) began in earnest in the post-watergate era in the united states with the passage of the federal election campaign act which created the federal election commission (fec), implemented disclosure requirements, donation limits, and federal financing of presidential elections.",,,

0," by permitting individuals or corporations to make unlimited contributions , the current legislation undermines the democratic character of the elective process .",,,

0, this was why the us supreme court ruled that the federal ban on spending by corporations was unconstitutional under the first amendment act in.,,,

1,this first of all makes the assumption that a strike against terrorists is going to be made.,,,
1," the debate is therefore not focused on whether there should be military action to strike at terrorists but whether we should be using unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs), sometimes called drones, in order to strike at these targets.",,,

1, the uavs used primarily for this purpose are the mq1 predators and the mq9 reapers.,,,
1," the more advanced reaper has a payload of 3,000 pounds allowing it to carry up tohellfire missiles and it can stay airborne forhours giving its operators plenty of time to confirm the target and choose the ideal time to attack.",,,

0, moreover the number of civilians killed in strikes is falling ;percent of casualties inwere civilians but bythis had fallen topercent and this is a figure that is likely to continue falling as drones improve technologically making identification easier and making strikes more precise .,,,
0, these figures show that the united states in its use of drones is not only hitting a lot of terrorist targets and eliminating them but is causing very little collateral damage in comparison to the number of strikes made .,,,
0, we need to eliminate terrorists somehow and uavs are the best possible equipment with which to carry out this mission .,,,
0, all the other options either would result in significantly more casualties or would have other problems that would likely allow terrorists to escape .,,,
0, first there is the collateral damage that would be caused by using other alternatives to striking terrorists .,,,
0," professor plaw of the university of massachusetts says that when terrorists were being confronted by the pakistani army , who were attacking at the behest of the united states ,% of casualties were collateral damage .",,,
0, a similar number of% was the figure when israel was targeting hamas .,,,
0, when compared to theor% collateral damage figures for uavs the choice should be easy .,,,
0, moreover other options have other disadvantages .,,,
0, sending a hit squad in to eliminate terrorists may mean little collateral damage but would cause a diplomatic crisis as it would be tantamount to invading another country .,,,
0, using a missile or local support on the other hand significantly increases the chances of the target escaping .,,,
0," pakistan 's isi , military intelligence , has for example been accused of helping the taliban -- they could hardly be trusted to kill them .",,,
0, when engaging in covert operations it is essential that the right target is identified so that the correct target is eliminated .,,,
0," this is something that using uavs allows as they are able to track their target , sometimes for days , before attacking .",,,
0, this means there is much more time for scrutiny of targets and possible collateral damage .,,,
0, this also means that there is plenty of room for the decisions to be made right at the top .,,,
0, every person on the kill list gets discussed at a weekly meeting of more thanmembers of the us government 's security apparatus .,,,
0, president obama himself signs off on strikes and can change the decision if the situation on the ground changes .,,,
0, former national security advisor jones says `` many times ... at the 11th hour we waved off a mission simply because the target had people around them and we were able to loiter on station until they did n't . '',,,
0, while uavs may be ` unmanned ' they are certainly heavily monitored as each drone hasmilitary personnel rotating in three shifts .,,,
0," they include seven joystick pilots , seven system operators , and five mission coordinators , there is also from the ciapeople , includingvideo crew members , andintelligence analysts .",,,
0," this means that there are a large number of eyeballs to make sure that the right person is being targeted , to check he is with as few others as possible before the strike .",,,
0, none of this would be possible with other forms of attack where the emphasis has to be on the speed of the operation .,,,
0, to put it bluntly any military or intelligence service wants to keep its own men safe while carrying out its missions ; unmanned aerial vehicles are the ultimate capability with which to manage this .,,,
0, no military or civilian personnel are going to be killed if the delivery vehicle is controlled from the united states .,,,
0, this means that unlike in other methods of attack the uav can take its time even if it is at risk .,,,
0," in the war in kosovo nato air forces had to launch their attacks from 15,000 feet due to worries they would be shot down .",,,
0, attacking from such a height from a fast moving aeroplane makes missing the target much more likely .,,,
1,inthe united kingdom became the third country to test and independently developed nuclear weapon.,,,
1, the country continues to have nuclear weapons in its arsenal and is one of the five nuclear weapons states set out in the nuclear non proliferation treaty of 1968.,,,
1, however despite having independently developed nuclear weapons the united kingdom now cooperates with the united states in developing its nuclear weapons.,,,
1, britain’s current nuclear deterrent is maintained by four vanguard submarines with the first having been commissioned in 1993.,,,
1, these submarines each carry sixteen trident missiles which were designed by the united states and are provided to the uk by a modification of the previous the polaris sales agreement.,,,
1, the submarines are expected to remain in service until the 2020s.,,,
1, inthe white paper ‘the future of the united kingdom’s nuclear deterrent’ argued that britain needs to retain a nuclear deterrent but did not take the final decision on the replacement of trident or if it is retained how much of a deterrent is needed.,,,
1, but because of the long lead time necessary for designing and building replacements work has already started on some of the components which would be necessary for new submarines such as the reactor cores.,,,
1, despite this the government maintains the final decision on trident has not yet been made and is expected in 2016.,,,
0, the trident weapons system while it may be a `` horrific part of our system '' is still necessary even in today 's post-cold war world .,,,
0," firstly through deterrence it protects us from being blackmailed by any other states , and in particular so called `` rogue states '' like north korea and potentially in the future iran who could threaten our vital interests -- such as closing the straits of hormuz .",,,
0," moreover having a second strike capability , the ability for nuclear weapons to survive a nuclear assault by an opponent so allowing retaliation , is also still necessary .",,,
0, it may currently seem unlikely that any of the major nuclear armed states will threaten the united kingdom however we do not know what may happen in the future and by the time a threat appears it would be too late to build a new nuclear second strike capability .,,,
0," currently the uk is recognised as a nuclear power by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty along with the usa , china , france and russia .",,,
0, all of whom are either modernising or maintaining their current nuclear arsenals .,,,
0, this means to not replace trident would mean that we 'd suffer a severe loss of status in relation to the other permanent members of the un security council .,,,
0, this would also raise questions of whether the uk even deserves its place as a member there as it would show the uk 's declining global role and military power .,,,
0," other countries that can be considered `` more representative '' such as india , the world 's largest democracy , now would be an obvious replacement at the top table .",,,
0," churchill said that the h bomb that it was `` our badge to the royal enclosure , at ascot , '' and today trident remains one of our master keys to the britain 's status at organisations such as the united nations security council .",,,
0, there are already plenty of reasons why other countries might be more deserving of a security council place than the uk ; we do n't need to add another .,,,
0, the uk nuclear weapons programme was first created in latea time when people were concerned about the us commitment to europe which was uncertain as the rise of the iron curtain had not been yet apparent .,,,
0, currently if we did n't replace trident and disarmed more likely than not we would fall under the american strategic nuclear umbrella which would be fair enough in the short term and medium term as the relationship is currently strong despite certain cobblestones .,,,
0," a similar thing also applies with the french but can we really rely on the americans to keep that umbrella extended over the long term when their interests and emphasis may shift , regardless of cultural or ideological links ?",,,
0, relying on someone else 's deterrent will always be risky as the us or france would not want to put themselves at risk of being attacked in order to deter an attack on us .,,,

1, the alternative vote system differs by ensuring that the winner of each constituency has to have the support of over half the voters – for this reason it is classed as a majoritarian system.,,,
1, av achieves this by asking each voter to rank the candidates in order of preference.,,,
1," first preference votes are then counted and if one candidate has over 50% of votes cast, they are automatically declared the winner.",,,

0, affirmative action is required to change negative perceptions of university life .,,,
0," in the status quo , many talented potential students are put off applying for top universities , or university at all , because of their negative perceptions of elite institutions .",,,

0," the only way to overcome this unfortunate stereotype of university is to change the student population , but this is impossible to do ` organically ' while so few people from minority backgrounds apply .",,,

1,intelligence services provide the government with essential information to make decisions in regards to threats to national security.,,,
1," there are three sources of threats to national security and therefore three ‘target areas’ for intelligence: domestic, foreign and military.",,,
1," in many countries (but not all), each target area has its own specific agency: for example, the uk has mi5 for domestic intelligence, sis (also known as mi6) for foreign intelligence and dis (defence intelligence staff) for military intelligence.",,,
1," the intelligence services usually perform the following four types of activities: intelligence gathering, analysis, counter-intelligence and covert action.",,,
1,"there are several methods of intelligence gathering, including ‘using personal contact’ such as paid informants, planting agents within organisations, etc. (called humint, human intelligence), inferring information from electronic signals (called sigint, signals intelligence) and more.",,,
1, counterintelligence refers to the activities employed by intelligence agencies/governments to prevent other countries/actors from successfully gathering intelligence against them.,,,
1, covert action is when an intelligence agency engages in clandestine operations against a target.,,,
1,"to protect national security, intelligence agencies are given broad and exceptional powers.",,,
1, exercising these powers can clash with citizens’ basic rights.,,,
1," in this casefile, i will explore this tension between national security and basic rights by focussing on the case for domestic intelligence in a democracy.",,,
1," the case for military and foreign intelligence in a democracy is more straightforward and more easily justified, but many of the arguments against domestic intelligence agencies could also apply against foreign and military intelligence.",,,
0, does domestic intelligence have a place in a functioning democracy and is it an infringement on this democracy?,,,
0,domestic intelligence is very important to the national security and to the safety of the public .,,,
0," domestic intelligence is imperative in preventing terrorist attacks on the country when terrorists are as likely to be natives as foreigners , for example the 7/7 bombers in britain were all native .",,,
0," in order for a domestic intelligence organization to be effective , its organizational discretion must be limited by establishing clear legislation that is not secret , on the focus , limits , and techniques of domestic intelligence .",,,
0," when this is in place domestic intelligence is not harmful , nor infringement on democracy -- it is in the people 's best interest .",,,
0," as professor dahl notes `` intelligence is about the thousands and thousands of routine , everyday observations and activities ... in many cases these observations , this intelligence , is about routine activities undertaken by ordinary americans and others who do not intend to cause harm . ''",,,
0, this intrusion is necessary in order to catch the few who do intend to do harm .,,,
0," domestic intelligence does require the collection of information , but this is not fundamentally different from a standard police investigation .",,,
0, the differences are minor when we have national security at stake .,,,
0," furthermore , the rights , duties and powers of a domestic intelligence service are carefully restricted by law .",,,
0," for example , under dutch law , the general intelligence and security service , aivd , is only allowed to wiretap someone after permission granted by the minister of interior affairs , the uk situation is very similar .",,,
0," generally speaking , for every surveillance action the domestic intelligence can take , it needs to weigh whether the action satisfies the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity , meaning that the invasiveness of a surveillance method should be proportional to the risk the person poses , and that the method chosen should be the least invasive of all possible methods .",,,
0," even if not every citizen can control exactly what the intelligence service does , there is sufficient political and judicial control .",,,
0," an example of this is a recent case involving the dutch aivd , which started wiretapping journalists after they had found a source within the aivd to leak about the run-up to the iraq war .",,,
0," the journalists were wiretapped but when the case came to court , the court judged that the aivd was in error , should stop harassing the journalists , and must delete the files on the journalists immediately .",,,
0," such cases show that the intelligence agencies , and those involved domestically in particular , have judicial and political oversight to make sure they remain within bounds .",,,
0, democracy is therefore not threatened as there is democratic oversight .,,,
0, domestic intelligence services are the only organization that is capable of performing counterintelligence .,,,
0," they have the capacity and the authority to detect foreign spies in the national jurisdiction , and experience with local surveillance and investigation .",,,
0," part of the job of domestic intelligence is to maintain a network of informers and agents , and this can be used to find and track foreign intelligence services on a mission -- these functions ca n't be easily performed by the military or foreign intelligence so an independent domestic intelligence agency is necessary .",,,

0, freedom of speech certainly may be curtailed when real harms can be shown to arise from it .,,,
0," extremist sites serve as centers of dangerous dissent , whose members threaten all of society .",,,
0," they promote a message that is fundamentally bad speech , because it can not it can not be argued with and promotes aims that are so anathema to free society that its dissemination represents a true threat to people 's safety .",,,
0, the threat extremists represent to free society demands that their right to speech online be curtailed .,,,
0," by blocking these sites , isps certainly are denying some freedom of speech , but it is a necessarily harmful form of speech that has no value in the global commons .",,,
0," thus , there is essentially no real loss of valuable speech in censoring extremist websites .",,,
0, isps are ultimately private providers of a service .,,,
0, because of this they should retain the right to restrict that service to certain groups .,,,
0," so long as isps make public their policy for what constitutes extremism so that consumers can decide if they want to opt into it , there is no real issue .",,,
0," there are many filters available to users to screen out certain materials already , for example internet providers offer customers the option to block adult content , and this is merely an extension of this approach .",,,
0, businesses must be able to sort their own ethos .,,,
0," some isps may not opt to use this power given to them by the state , but others may not wish to carry content they consider dangerous .",,,
0," because extremism is on the very fringe of speech and opinion , and because of the potential dangers that can arise from it , it is only right that the state give some ability to isps to block objectionable content .",,,
0, the isps are the gatekeepers of information .,,,
0," when the internet places no moral judgments on content and the isps let all information through without commentary , it lends an air of permissiveness to the beliefs put forward , that they are held by reasonable people .",,,
0," the internet is a great tool for education , but also one that can be used to sow misinformation and extreme rhetoric .",,,
0, extremist groups have been able to use the internet to a remarkable extent in promoting their beliefs and recruiting new members .,,,
0," worse still , the administrators of these extremist sites are able to choke of things like dissenting commenters , giving the illusion that their view is difficult , or even impossible to reasonably challenge .",,,
0," in doing so they create an echo chamber for their ideas that allows them to spread and to affect people , particularly young people susceptible to such manipulation .",,,
0, the best example of this activity is in the international jihadist community and its reaching out to people in the west .,,,
0," young disaffected muslims have received an introduction to militant islamism from sites often based abroad , but also some domestically , increasing the number of believers in an extreme , militant form of that religion .",,,
0," by denying these people a platform on the internet , isps are able to not only make a moral stance that is unequivocal , but also to choke off access to new members who can be saved by never seeing the negative messages .",,,
0," the greatest fear people have about extremist groups is not their rhetoric , but the actions the rhetoric precipitates .",,,
0, extremists have proven adept at setting up basic websites through which to build communities to organize and coordinate extreme actions .,,,
0," this means in the most limited form the coordinating of extremist demonstrations and rallies , but also violent and terrorist actions .",,,
0," the best example of this is as-sahab , al-qaeda 's media arm , which has used an extensive web presence to galvanize supporters and to coordinate terrorist attacks .",,,
0," in using the tools of the mass media extremists have succeeded in bringing supporters to their cause , people who are often geographically diffuse , into a close community capable of action and disruption that harms all citizens .",,,
0, if blocking these websites entirely isps would pose a significant barrier to these extremist groups organising .,,,
0, even more damaging to these networks in the long terms would be the drop in recruitment due to a reduction in their reach .,,,
0," isps can significantly hamper these organizations from ever embarking on serious violent actions , and from coalescing in the first place by denying them their most effective springboard .",,,
0, the most important effect is in the prevention of radicalization in the first place .,,,
0," preventing , or at least hampering access to extremist materials serves to keep impressionable , swayable people from experiences that might turn them to extremism .",,,
0, as the access providers for the internet isps are best placed to implement policies for blocking extremist sites and so are the natural option for deciding when and which sites to block .,,,
0," furthermore , because the state is often slow due its extensive bureaucracy , it is less able to respond with alacrity to extremist sites popping up online .",,,
0, isps on the other hand are likely to be able to act as soon as they are informed of the existence of a website whereas working through government would simply add an extra layer of requests and orders .,,,
0, the isps blocking the site also creates a fire break between the state and the action so not giving the extremists the ammunition that state intervention might give them .,,,

1, we usually consider that governmental transparency is a part of good governance in a democracy.,,,

1, the internet has also changed the realm of whistleblowing.,,,

0," trust is essential in all sorts of aspect of our lives ; we trust that the paper money we have is actually worth more than a scrap of paper , that doctors performing surgery know what they are doing , that we wo n't be attacked in the street , and that the government is looking after our interests .",,,
0, in order to create that trust there needs to be transparency so that we know that our institutions are trustworthy .,,,
0, it is the ability to check the facts and the accountability that comes with transparency that creates trust .,,,
0, and this in turn is what makes them legitimate .,,,
0, the need for trust applies just as much to security as any other walk of life .,,,
0," citizens need to trust that the security services really are keeping them safe , are spending taxpayers ' money wisely , and are acting in a fashion that is a credit to the country .",,,
0, unfortunately if there is not transparency there is no way of knowing if this is the case and so often the intelligence services have turned out to be an embarrassment .,,,
0," as has been the case with the cia and it 's the use of torture following 9/11 , for which there are still calls for transparency on past actions .",,,
0, the nation exits for its citizens ; it depends on their consent to maintain order and to raise finances .,,,
0," the main purpose of the state is law and order , and national defence , both of which are covered by security .",,,
0," as an area that is so central to the role of the government it is vital that the stakeholders in that government , its citizens , know what it is the state is doing in their name for their security .",,,
0, the obama administration for example refuses to acknowledge that it is carrying out a campaign using drones while at the same time saying it is `` the only game in town in terms of confronting and trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . '',,,
0," if the us government is bombing another country then the us people have a right to know with much less ambiguity what exactly is being done , who is being hit , when and where .",,,
0, they also need to be informed of any possible consequences .,,,
0, transparency is necessary in international relations .,,,
0, states need to know what each other are doing to assess their actions .,,,
0, without any transparency the hole is filled by suspicion and threat inflation that can easily lead to miscalculation and even war .,,,
0, the cuban missile crisis is a clear example where a lack of transparency on either side about what they were willing to accept and what they were doing almost lead to nuclear war .,,,
0, it is notable that one of the responses to prevent a similar crisis was to install a hotline between the white house and kremlin .,,,
0," a very small , but vital , step in terms of openness .",,,
0, today this is still a problem ; china currently worries about the us ` pivot ' towards asia complaining it `` has aroused a great deal of suspicion in china . '',,,
0, `` a huge deficit of strategic trust lies at the bottom of all problems between china and the united states . '',,,
0, the result would be an inevitable arms race and possible conflict .,,,
0," transparency is fundamental in making sure that mistakes do n't happen , or when they do that they are found and corrected quickly with appropriate accountability .",,,
0," this applies as much , if not more , to the security apparatus than other walks of life .",,,
0, in security mistakes are much more likely to be a matter of life and death than in most other walks of life .,,,
0, they are also likely to be costly ; something the military and national security apparatus is particularly known for .,,,
0, an audit of the pentagon infound that the us department of defense wasted $billion over two years .,,,
0," this kind of waste can only be corrected if it is found out about , and for that transparency is necessary .",,,
0, transparency is necessary to avoid public relations disasters ; particularly in countries where the media has some freedom to investigate for themselves .,,,
0, it is clearly the best policy for the military to make sure all the information is released along with the reasons behind actions rather than having the media finding individual pieces of a whole and speculating to fill the gaps .,,,
0, a good example would be a collision on 16th januarybetween a b-52 bomber and a kc-135 tanker while attempting to refuel that destroyed both planes .,,,
0," accidents happen , and this one costlives , but could have been much worse as the b-52 had four nuclear bombs on board were not armed and did not detonate .",,,
0, in this case an initial lack of information rapidly turned into a public relations disaster that was stemmed by much more openness by the military and the us ambassador in spain .,,,
0, the release of the information reduces the room for the press to fill in the gaps with harmful speculation .,,,
0," in this case there was never much chance of national security implications or a break with spain as the country was ruled by the dictator franco , someone who would hardly pay attention to public opinion .",,,
0, but in a democracy a slow and closed response could seriously damage relations .,,,

1,one of the requirements set by the roman catholic church for priests is that they remain celibate.,,,

0, priestly celibacy is out-dated .,,,
0, it sets the priest apart from the modern world and the experiences of his parishioners .,,,

1,the topic of tolerance towards religious symbols has caused much controversy among many both in the western and eastern hemispheres.,,,
1, religious symbols are incorporated into every religion and are expressions of both faith and devotion.,,,
1," examples of religious symbols include the christian, particularly catholic, crucifix, the muslim hijab and the sikh kirpan.",,,
1," for many people, particularly from the west, the hijab or muslim head covering symbolises the repressive and extremely regressive character of islam.",,,
1," however, for its supporters, it represents the defence of women's modesty against the assault of modern society.",,,
1," in this way, religious symbols and their meanings and consequences differ depending on cultural perception.",,,
1," recent controversy has arisen around france's plan to ban the hijab, along with other visible religious symbols, in schools.",,,
1, france's secular constitution provides the grounds for excluding religion from their schools.,,,
1, however it is not just western countries who have taken this approach.,,,
1," turkey has for many years suppressed the hijab in schools, public buildings and among employees of the state.",,,
1," in the aftermath of 9/11, many minority muslim communities in western countries view attacks on the hijab as part of a wider attack on islam conducted in tandem with the 'war on terror'.",,,
1," in a similar way, there is anxiety as to the freedom to bring sikh kirpans' to school because they are ceremonial daggers.",,,
1, it should be noted that the sikh religion requires the kirpan to carried with the sikh at all times.,,,
1," in this way, the practice of the religion is seen to be restricted and can, therefore, be possibly considered as discrimination.",,,
1," however, there are other forms of religious symbolism that are not necessarily a requirement of the religion and are merely an expression of faith.",,,
1, there was recent controversy over a british woman who lost her job simply because she continued wearing a crucifix after she was told not to by her employers.,,,
1, all of these points present an interesting question.,,,
1, should authorities be more lenient on religious symbols that are a requirement of the person?,,,
0," also, should there be a limit to physical or material expressions of faith?",,,
0,"religious symbols are seen to , in some cases , increase the equality divide between genders .",,,
0," as an example , the muslim hijab is considered by some as a very powerful symbol for the oppression of women , particularly in countries such as saudi arabia or afghanistan where it is compulsory .",,,
0," therefore , when it is worn in western countries that encourage democracy and equality , the wearing of the hijab is seen as almost counter-productive to the goals of democratic society .",,,
0," for this reason belgium has recently banned the wearing of the full muslim veil , much like france in 2010.1 often muslim dress rules for women are seen as more severe than those for men .",,,
0, inequality between men and women is a form of discrimination and liberal societies should fight all forms of discrimination .,,,
0," as well as division in society in general , religious symbols are also a source of division within school environments .",,,
0, the hijab causes schools many problems .,,,
0," it is potentially divisive in the classroom , marking some children out as different from the others and above the rules that the school enforces for everyone else .",,,
0, this may lead to alienation and bullying .,,,
0," full headscarves may also be impractical or dangerous in some lessons , for example pe , swimming , or in technology and science lessons where machinery is being operated .",,,
0," in the same way , there have been discussions as to whether to ban the display of crucifixes in public classrooms .",,,
0, authorities in italy have followed through with the ban saying that such a christian symbol segregates those who are not christian .1 religious symbols can be seen as possible tools for fuelling division within society .,,,
0, when some women wear the hijab it creates pressure on other muslim women to also cover their heads .,,,
0, pressure comes both socially from wanting to look like other women in their community and religiously from imams and family leaders pressing for observance .,,,
0," as such , muslims themselves are divided and religious oppression against women is internalized .1 approving of muslim head coverings in society cements the hijab as an essential tenet of islam , in the minds of non-muslims as well as believers .",,,
0," however , many different schools of islam exist and as on other issues , they often disagree how to interpret the koran 's dress prescriptions .",,,
0, moderate interpretations accept modest forms of modern dress while severe interpretations require full covering with the burka or similar veil .,,,
0, banning the veil furthers the cause of moderate interpretations and prevents the entrenchment of severe interpretations .,,,
0, a ban would be simple to create and enforce .,,,
0, religious symbols are for the most part meant to be shown therefore it is simple for police or authorities to check that someone is not wearing them .,,,
0," there are many societies that have had bans on a religious symbol in public buildings , for example in france where there is a ban on religious symbols in schools has been in force since.",,,
0," in france the ban is made even easier to enforce by restricting it to ` conspicuous ' religious apparel .1 moreover when the ban is only when entering public buildings it can be enforced by the teacher , or the building 's security guards rather than being an issue for the police to deal with .",,,
0, many societies are founded on secular values that do not permit the sponsorship of any religion by the state .,,,
0, british society aspires to this and has consciously acted to separate religion from state authority with many organisations such as the national secular society encouraging the suppression of any religious expression in public places .1 in this climate it is important that all citizens of the state are seen as equal .,,,
0," if some dress differently to others , deliberately identifying themselves as members of one religion , this can harm the unity and ethos of the state .",,,
0, this holds particularly true for institutions of the state like schools and government offices .,,,
0," in this way , it is possible to deduce that religious symbols are detrimental to the secular and equality focused identity of western society .",,,
1,"a creative commons license is a kind of copyright license that gives people the right to use, share, and expand upon a creator’s work whether this is an art work, a piece of literature, or a scientific or academic material.",,,
1, it offers a significant protection against accusations of copyright infringement and is believed by some to offer artists flexibility they may desire.,,,
1, however it also erodes artists’ control of their work because it can be reused without permission meaning it may be used in contexts which the original creator may not have envisaged or approve of.,,,
1,attendant in all this is the additional issue of how the government should license work that it commissions.,,,
1, work for government is almost by definition being carried out for the people in one form or another so should all work done by government have a creative commons license and therefore be open to those people?,,,
1," the state engages in a lot of work that is licensed; it funds art, and culture (usually only in part) but the state also funds scientific and academic research, the creation of large amounts of software, the creation of large data resources, the development of weapons systems, for all creative commons licencing could apply but in some cases it may not be wise to do so.",,,
1,"some governments, such as the united states already go part way towards making work they fund available to the public.",,,
1, any “government [that] work is prepared by an officer or employee of the united states government as part of that person's official duties” is in the public domain.,,,
1, which means they are similarly open to reuse and reproduction as if they were creative commons.,,,
1, however it is notable that this does not apply to works produced by government contractors or by institutions that are largely or fully funded by government such as the smithsonian which this motion includes.,,,
0, everyone benefits and is enriched by open access to resources that the government can provide .,,,
0," a work is the province of its creator in most respects , since it is from the mind and hand of its creator that it is born .",,,
0," but when the state opts to fund a project , it too becomes a part-owner of the ideas and creation that springs forth .",,,
0, the state should thus seek to make public the work it spends taxpayer money to create .,,,
0, this is in exactly the same way that when an employee of a company creates something presuming there is the correct contract the rights to that work go to the company not the employee .,,,
0," the best means for doing this is through mandating that work created with state funding be released under creative commons licenses , which allow the work to be redistributed , re-explored , and to be used as springboards for new , derivative works .",,,
0," this is hampered by either the creator , or the government , retaining stricter forms of copyright , which effectively entitles the holder of the copyright to full control of the work that would not exist had it not been for the largesse of society .",,,

0," current copyright law assigns too many rights , automatically , to the creator .",,,
0," law gives the generator a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse , except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements .",,,
0, making the creative commons license the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of people 's defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like .,,,
0," the creative commons license guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors , something that is particularly useful for building programs that need to be maintained .",,,
0, at base the default setting of somehow having absolute control means creators of work often do not even consider the reuse by others in the commons .,,,
0," the result is creation and then stagnation , as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator .",,,
0," by normalizing the creative commons through the state funding system , more people will be willing to accept the creative commons as their private default .",,,
0," this means greater access to more works , for the enrichment of all .",,,
0, the result is that a norm is created whereby the assumption is that information should be open and shared rather than controlled and owned for profit by an individual or corporation .,,,
0, all governments recognise a right to freedom of information as part of freedom of expression making it the government 's responsibility to provide access to public information and many are enabling this through creating freedom of information acts .,,,
0, this is simply another part of that right .,,,
0, the nature of the internet and mass media is such that many creators can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them .,,,
0, creative commons provides vast benefits in allowing a creation to have life after its funding has run out or beyond its original specifications .,,,
0, creative commons means that the original work can be considered to be a building block that can simply be used as a foundation for more applications and modifications .,,,
0, for example in many countries government has for decades produced official maps for the country but these can only be irregularly updated -- often with a new release of a paper map .,,,
0, however the internet means that maps could easily be regularly updated online by enthusiastic users and volunteers as things change on the ground if those maps were available under creative commons .,,,
0," this is why applications like openstreetmap or google maps , which is not creative commons but can be easily built upon by creative commons projects , are now much more successful than traditional mapping and has often forced government map providers to follow suit such as the uk 's ordnance survey making many of its maps free and downloadable .",,,

0," while the us succeeded in promptly removing the blueprints , removing blueprints from the internet will quickly prove impossible as the phenomenon inevitably becomes more widespread .5 this is dangerous for all the same reasons that we do not allow people to produce their own weapons : we can not ensure criminals or mentally ill people do not gain access to them , and we can not track them after they have been used to commit a crime .",,,
0," furthermore , they can be made of plastic , thus making them essentially undetectable to most security scans .",,,

1,the age of consent refers to the age at which a person’s assent to have sex is recognised as valid in the eyes of the law.,,,
1," men (and sometimes women, depending upon local law) who engage in sexual activity with young men or women below this age are therefore guilty of a criminal offence.",,,
1, this is true even if it was the young person who wanted to have sex and agreed to it in total understanding of what they were doing – the agreement of the person below the age of consent is simply invalid in the eyes of the law.,,,
1," yet in many countries this offence (often called ‘statutory rape’, as in the usa) is one that is very severely punished, sometimes with a sentence of up to life imprisonment.",,,
1," ages of consent also vary greatly depending on sexuality, in most countries people have to be older to consent to homosexual sex than to heterosexual sex.",,,
1, it is the combination of these factors that make age of consent laws highly controversial.,,,
1,"age of consent laws are highly complex because of their many variations, and therefore all too often create difficulty for students in age of consent debates.",,,
1," to avoid confusion it is best to:(a) firstly think about the ‘basic’ age of consent rule: for heterosexuals -no sex with anyone belowin england,in most parts of australia,in canada,in italy and varying from state to state betweenandin the u.s.a.(b) secondly think about the ‘plus’ element – many places in addition to the ‘basic’ rule, also make it an offence for you to have sex with persons below a certain age (usuallyor 21) if that person is in a relationship of ‘trust or dependency’ with you.",,,
1," this would include relationships between children in foster care and those responsible for their welfare, and those between teacher and student.",,,
1," such places include england, australia and canada.",,,
1,"(c) thirdly think about the ‘minus’ element – in subtraction from the above two rules, states may make it not an offence if: (i) you reasonably thought the person was above the ‘basic’ age; or (ii) you reasonably thought you were married to the person ; or (iii) both partners are in similar age (usually 2-5 years).",,,
1," in most jurisdictions if the adolescent is really, really young (i.e.in england) then even these ‘minus’ elements will not be allowed as a defence.",,,
1,there are therefore an almost infinite number of ways in which age of consent laws can be reformed.,,,
1, it is less important to know the age details of each rule in each country (16 years?,,,
1,years?,,,
1, 14?,,,
1, 15?),,,
1,.,,,
1," it is instead very important to think about the ‘basic’, ‘plus’, and ‘minus’ ideas in age of consent laws (such as, should it be a defence if someone had sex with a really, really young girl but honestly believed she was above the legal age of consent?)",,,
1,.,,,
1,"this article considers the arguments whether, in principle, age of consent rules should be made more liberal (lower or no ‘basic’ age and more generous ‘minus’ elements) or made stricter (same or higher ‘basic’ age and with less or no allowance for ‘minus’ elements).",,,
0," the freedom of sexual expression , and exploration , is not only a matter of choice which is fundamental to the individual -- it is also particularly important to young people as they proceed through the stage of adolescence into young adulthood .",,,
0, age of consent laws place artificial limits on this freedom .,,,
0," sex is entirely natural and should be celebrated in the context of loving relationships , not criminalised and put under the prying eye of an authoritarian state .",,,
0," violence , coercion and exploitation in sexual relationships should still be punished , but not consensual activity .",,,
0, such restrictions go against the human rights to privacy and of freedom of expression .,,,
0," the concept that young people do not know what they are doing is flawed , because every person who has gone through sexual development has learnt by doing .",,,
0, there is no process of suddenly coming into full knowledge without acting and exploration .,,,
0, such exploration would be more safely done in an environment that does n't criminalize it .,,,
0," such criminalization can actaully lead to the very harm that the law ostensibly seeks to avoid , coercion and exploitation , for it is people who are naturally more inclined to coercion and exploitation that will disregard the law anyway .",,,
0, this feeds the lambs to the wolves .,,,
0," some countries have one age of consent for young females , say, and a different , higher age of consent for young males or for having anal sex , say.",,,
0," this means that a heterosexual adult male who wants to have sex with a 17-year-old female is free to do so , but a homosexual adult male can not have intercourse with a young man who is.",,,
0," not only are such laws clearly discriminatory , they entrench and perpetuate the myths , stereotypes , and prejudices against homosexuals and homosexual sex .",,,
0," age of consent laws , if we are to have them at all , should be equalised across the genders .",,,
0, the idea that young people should not be having sex is a leftover relic from the past : its justifications are anachronistic and have little place in modern times .,,,
0," age of consent laws were the product of a ` purity campaign ' in britain in the 1800s , when it was believed that sex was a ` male privilege ' , that it led to the sexual ruin of young women , that it meant the loss of their virtue , which was a fate worse than death , and that it contributed to women 's second class citizenship .",,,
0," in the uk the age ofwas chosen and set in, more thanyears ago , and has remained ever since .",,,
0, today these ideas would offend both men and women .,,,
0," age of consent laws are in fact dangerous because they drive underground the very people who should be , and are in most need of , receiving contraceptives , advice on safe sex , and access to health and other educational services .",,,
0," this is true both of the ` statutory rapist ' as well as the under-16 consenting ` victim ' , who may worry about having assisted in the commission of a crime .",,,

1,"  although arranged marriages are an entrenched cultural norm in many european-asian communities, there is still a lot of controversy over their practice.",,,
1," although there are differences in the ways cultures carry them out, they can be broadly defined as forms of matrimony where the individuals involved are brought together by parents or family members, and not necessarily through their own choices.",,,
1, however they are different from forced marriages in the sense that arrange marriages can involve the consent of the man and woman at the centre.,,,
1, forced marriage was made punishable by law in the uk in early 2012.,,,
1," before then laws were introduced in britain inallowing people to apply for forced marriage protection orders, where penalties for its breach can include up to two years in prison.",,,
1, france also banned forced marriages and tried in recent years to discourage its continued usage via public education campaigns.,,,
1," yet arranged marriages are practiced across societies in south asia, north africa and the middle east, particularly in communities that are predominantly hindu and muslim.",,,
1," many diaspora communities in britain also practice them, and it was widespread among white europeans for centuries.",,,
1, however many people in the west now see it as clashing far too much with more modern ideas of marriage where people often enter into matrimony independently of their families.,,,
1,"  however, sympathisers claim that arranged marriages are not necessarily damaging or threatening to young men or women if they are not forced, and are a vital part of the cultural heritage and functioning of various diaspora communities in europe.",,,
1,"    as the use of forced marriage already carries strict penalties, this debate will focus purely on arranged marriages.",,,
1, the mechanism would be to outlaw marriages where the individuals at the centre have been introduced to each other by parents or relatives and had little or no contact with each other beforehand.,,,
1," police officers, social workers and other public service workers would be made aware of the new regulations and be required to make those in their communities who might be vulnerable more aware of their rights.",,,
0,"  even if marriages are not made absolutely mandatory , covert family pressure can still propel people into unions where they will be unhappy .",,,
0, this is a form of restricted liberty as the consequences of people rebelling against arranged marriages can include being forced to leave home or suffering stigmatisation and reduced contact with family members .,,,
0, the stigma may also be the other way with the family feeling shame when their children reject their arrangements this in turn can lead to attempts at compulsion and even some cases like that of shafilea ahmed murder for the rejection of the marriage .,,,
0, clearly there is a thin line between arranged and forced marriages .,,,
0," although things like stigmatisation are harder to police than physical intimidation or violence , it is only right that the state steps in to regulate these harms , giving people the legal mandate to challenge the practice as well as to discourage relatives from attempting it from the outset .",,,
0, arranged marriages have not been a part of the cultures of most european countries for many years now .,,,
0," part of the reason for this is because ideas about marriage have become more progressive , with people accepting that men and women of any orientation should be allowed to choose their own partners .",,,
0," this was even the case during the socially conservative era of the 1950s , when it was generally accepted in countries like britain that people would court and meet their partners independently of their parents .",,,
0, arranged marriages also conform to a view of women in particular which regards them as chattel .,,,
0," this does not fit in with the type of egalitarianism many european countries seek to practice , and thus does not conform to western notions of individual rights .",,,
0," it is also hypocritical to adopt a double-standard with diaspora communities , turning a blind eye to practices which many other majority groups find reprehensible .",,,
0, the rights and norms of a country of block of countries such as the eu must apply to all .,,,
0," arranged marriages are often different when practiced in the home countries of many immigrant families in europe , where women often have networks of friends and relatives to rely on .",,,
0," the danger with allowing arranged marriages to happen in eu countries are that the women at the centre are often far more vulnerable , away from their own family , unfamiliar with the local language and fully reliant on their husband 's family .",,,
0, this makes it easier for domestic abuses to go undetected which is simply compounding problems of underreporting .,,,
0, it is therefore likely that there is more domestic violence within arranged marriages .,,,
0," this is shown even amongst women who still consented to arranged marriages but faced abuse from their husbands -- such as with the case of razia sodagar , whose husband abandoned her for another woman after she failed to fall pregnant .",,,
0," this illustrates how it is not always easy to draw a clear division between arranged marriages and forced marriages , as the former can often bear the same characteristics as the latter .",,,

1,"an amnesty can be defined as ‘a general pardon, esp for offences against a government’.",,,
1, in the case of illegal immigrants this would be for the offence of entering and remaining in a country illegally and would in most cases not apply to those who have committed other crimes so there is usually an emphasis that an amnesty would only be for those who are law abiding – except for being in the country illegally.,,,
1," amnesties may be granted by the executive or the legislature for a country, in the case of a general amnesty for migrants this would probably need both and would likely be a highly controversial move in any country.",,,
1, politics about illegal immigrants are likely to be more highly charged in countries that already have a lot of migrants (whether legal or illegal) which means that migration is considered an social and economic issue that affects much of the electorate.,,,
1,despite their potential for controversy amnesties for illegal immigrants are not uncommon.,,,
1," poland granted an amnesty for illegal immigrants in 2011, newt gingrich has made some kind of amnesty part of his campaign for the republican nomination for the presidency in the united states and it was also a campaign pledge in the in the uk general election by the liberal democrats in 2010.",,,
1," while the uk has never granted a general amnesty and the united states has only had one in some countries they are quite common; france and portugal have offered two each, italy five and spain six amnesties.",,,
1,the proposition in the debate would have to give some idea of what conditions they are attaching to the amnesty and whether there are any limitations on it.,,,
1, often more there are proposals for more limited amnesties rather than a general amnesty in order to reduce the political backlash that could result from a more indiscriminate policy.,,,
0, amnesty is the only way to deal with the fundamental problem behind immigration ; the developed world much richer and has more jobs available than the developing world .,,,
0," for example the usa has a per capita gdp of $ 48,100 by comparison mexico 's is only $ 15,100 using ppp the gap with the central american countries to the south of mexico is even starker with guatemalan gdp/capita at $ 5,000 .",,,

0," amnesties will help allow labour to get to where it is needed , through nafta the us is integrating north america but it is specifically excluding labour from this integration while tightening border controls at the mexican border .",,,
0, amnesties would help to counter-act the problems caused by leaving labour as the resource that is not allowed to cross borders and so provide benefits to both the host economy and the country of origin for the migrants .,,,

0," migrants , including illegal migrants , are necessary for the economies of rich countries .",,,
0," there are schemes run by these countries that allow the migration of skilled workers for jobs where there is a skills shortage in the native population , for example the united kingdom takes in a lot of migrants to work as doctors and migrants .",,,

0," approximately 6.3 million illegal immigrants are working in the usa , and these are benefiting the economy .",,,
0, the federal reserve bank of dallas says `` the pace of recent u.s. economic growth would have been impossible without immigration .,,,

0," for example in germany bya third of the population will be over, and over the nextyears will as a result loose five million workers from the current workforce ofmillion .",,,
0, while increasing retirement age can mean that these reductions in the size of the workforce come later to maintain the size of the workforce immigration or a rapid increase in birth rate is necessary .,,,
0," these countries in order to maintain the size of their economies will therefore either have to rapidly increase productivity , which itself may not be easy as they are already the most productive nations , or else allow migrants to fill the gaps in the labour force .",,,

1,"college football is the only major sport, collegiate and professional, that does not have a standard playoff at the end of the season to determine a champion.",,,
1," the creation of the bowl championship series (bcs) inwas intended to cure some of these problems, by offering up a tiered system of bowl-games that matched equivalently seeded teams against each other, and which matched up - supposedly - the two best teams in the country against one another in the national championship.",,,

1," an undefeated auburn was denied such a chance in 2004, boise state’s undefeatedseason - which included a win over heavily-favoured oklahoma in the fiesta bowl - was not worthy to be rewarded with a shot at the national championship, and utah's undefeated team inwas also denied a chance.",,,
1, supporters of these teams and others have argued that a playoff - which would likely take the form oforteams - would give a fairer chance to such teams to demonstrate that they are the rightful national champions.,,,
1, the idea has gained so much support over the years that a bill was drafted in the senate incalled the college football playoffs act of 2009.,,,

0," however , if undefeated teams are unable to compete it makes the system incredibly unfair , and reduces the legitimacy of the bcs title itself , undermining the value of the competition overall .",,,
0," finally , as noted football analyst michael shull notes , due to flaws in the computer algorithms used to allocated bcs places , some teams that do well for a single season as an outlier or due to a positive change for the team do not get into the cup .",,,
0, this potentially means that the same teams consistently get into the cup and gain $million in revenue regardless of whether they win or lose .,,,
0, as such this system ensures that those who do get selected just get richer and better and thus become more likely to be picked by the computer system in the future .,,,

0, with history supporting this idea all players and fans are likely to feel tension during the playoff games which directly contributes to the enjoyment of a game .,,,
0," further , given the prevalence of late game comebacks in american football , due the ever present threat of an interception , it means that fans are still likely to enjoy games even when their team is likely to lose going into the later quarters .",,,

0," the issue with the bcs system , as mentioned above , is that teams selected by an often broken and biased bcs mechanism receive more money and exposure than more talented , harder working institutions , making them more likely to be selected by the same mechanism in the future .",,,
0, standout teams that only perform that well for a season are able to get significantly more exposure under the proposition model .,,,
0, due to the very high profile nature of playoff games - as well as the fact that there would simply be more playoff games with palpably fair and meritocratic outcomes later in the playoffs - more people will watch college football .,,,
0," specifically , including more teams in a playoff based competition will mean that more fans get their favourites in to the playoffs and as such more people watch .",,,

0," instead , it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys .",,,
0, this kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves .,,,
0," in this way , the lack of media coverage of women 's sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one 's ability ; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do .",,,
0,"  by forcing the media to provide equal coverage of both men 's and women 's sport , we take an effective step in breaking these societal discourses and transforming gender perceptions .",,,
0, this is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women .,,,
0," as more women take part in sport , this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which , in turn , induces further women to become engaged in sport .",,,
0, this is a desirable outcome from the government 's perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active .,,,
0," those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like coronary heart disease and cancer , but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising , and the joy of feeling physically fit .",,,

0, it will punish hundreds of athletes and coaches who are n't implicated in cases of abuse .,,,
0," yet , on a balance of harms , the disappointment those people feel ca n't be compared to the suffering of an athlete who is beaten and starved and conditioned into a mode of thinking where they accept this without putting up a fight .",,,

0," it 's more important to ensure all athletes can train in a safe environment free from physical and mental abuse , than it is to safeguard against the disappointment of professional athletes who want to compete .",,,
0," given that there are major sporting events annually or bi-annually , usually , it 's not as if those forced to miss out ca n't compete again soon .",,,
0, athletes dedicate their lives to their sport and becoming the world 's best at what they do .,,,
0, they are willing to put their body and minds through all sorts of punishment to do this .,,,
0," as such , they 're not in a position to judge what is and is n't an acceptable training method .",,,
0, if they 're told that starvation makes them more likely to win gold then their intense desire for olympic glory often clouds their judgment and ability to make rational choices for themselves .,,,
0," their coaches are authority figures who assumed to have their best interests in mind , and most athletes also assume their coaches know more than them about how to achieve glory .",,,
0," so , if a gymnastics coach tells her athlete that she needs to starve herself to win gold , the athlete will think themselves a bad athlete if they refuse .",,,
0, this is shown by the long history of drug use in the olympics where both coaches and athletes know it is wrong to use drugs but still do so in the hope it will bring them gold .,,,
0," because of this , the iaff has to make this decision for them .",,,
0," it also means that the chance of whistleblowing is low , since athletes can not rationally consider whether the training methods are acceptable .",,,
0, so it has to set an incredibly punitive deterrent to make sure coaches are n't tempted to use a training method they probably wo n't be caught for .,,,
0," just as an employer has a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees , the iaaf has a duty to provide a safe environment for their athletes .",,,

1,"bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of spain, portugal, southern france and some latin american countries (mexico, colombia, venezuela, peru and ecuador), in which one or more bulls are baited and usually killed by a matador in a bullring for sport and entertainment.",,,
1, it is often called a blood sport by its detractors but followers of the spectacle regard it as a fine art and not a sport as there are no elements of competition in the proceedings.,,,
1," bullfighting is banned in most countries, and has been banned more recently in some countries and regions with long histories and traditions with the event.",,,
1," most notably, bullfighting was banned inin the spanish region of catalonia and its largest city barcelona, where it has a centuries long history and attracted international fame.",,,
1," at the same time, places like madrid have responded to such actions by officially preserving bullfighting as an art form.",,,
1, this means that anti-bullfighting activists can be charged with a crime and a substantial fine for disrupting the patrimony of bullfighting and spanish culture.,,,
0, these historic actions have re-enlivened the debate about bullfighting in spain and around the world.,,,
0,"bullfighting constitutes animal torture because it is exactly the suffering of the animal from which the entertainment of the crowd is drawn , and the level of suffering inflicted is on the level of that caused by torture .",,,
0," jeremy bentham argued that `` cock-fights and bull-fights , the chase of the hare and the fox , fishing , and other amusements of the same kind , necessarily suppose a want of reflection or a want of humanity ; since these sports inflict upon sensitive beings the most lively sufferings , and the most lingering and painful death that can be imagined . ''",,,
0,"  the want of humanity even in modern bullfighting is shown by the sadistic cruelties inflicted on the bulls : according to anti-bullfight veterinarian josé zaldívar , in the great majority of cases , the matador missed the vital spot that would cause the bull to die quickly .",,,
0, `` these provoke internal bleeding .,,,
0," it is a slow , agonising death -- as the high acidity of their blood proves . ''",,,
0,"  at the end of the fight , the bull may not be yet dead while his body parts are cut-off to be kept as trophies .",,,
0," spanish bull breeders receive eu agricultural subsidies , meaning that , in the eu , taxpayers ' money from all countries , not just those with legal bullfighting , goes to support this terrible industry .",,,
0,"  also , in order to reduce the risk to the matador , sometimes the bull 's horns are shaved .",,,
0, this can inflict some pain on the bull and can also make it more sensitive to other forms of pain during the fight .,,,
0,"  moreover , bulls are not the only creatures to suffer in bullrings .",,,
0," the tormented bull does not understand that it is the man on the horse 's back that is causing his pain , only that he is in agony .",,,
0, he therefore sees the horse as his enemy as much as the man .,,,
0," it 's not unusual for horses used in bullfights to be so badly gored by the bulls that they have to be killed , but only after they have been dragged from the ring and the view of the spectators .",,,
0,"  all this suffering makes bullfighting as unacceptable as the many other kinds of animal cruelty which most countries ban , such as cockfighting , dogfighting or any other form of grievous harm inflicted on an animal for ` entertainment ' purposes .",,,
0,  we have these laws because governments have generally acknowledged the truth of bentham 's words : `` it does n't matter if they can reason ; it does n't matter if they can speak ; what does matter is if they can suffer . '',,,
0,"  all nations need to follow through on this principle by making bullfighting illegal , just like any other form of animal torture .",,,
0, if a creature suffers then there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration .,,,
0," all animals are sentient beings that experience joy , happiness , fear and pain , in the same way that human beings do .",,,
0," as bentham previously noted , it does not matter that they can not express this suffering in the same way as humans can , by speaking about it , or reason about their suffering in the same way - the important thing is that they can suffer in the first place .",,,
0, we can have no right whatsoever to make them suffer for our ` enjoyment ' .,,,
0," if any torture inflicted to an animal deserves condemnation , bullfights are the worst kind of torture since they are performed solely in the name of entertainment .",,,
0, we must end the animals ' torture and stop these shows of brutality and violence .,,,
0, it is too small a step from the intentional infliction of pain on an animal to the torture and killing of human beings .,,,
0,"  bullfights perpetuate the idea that injuring and killing an animal for amusement is acceptable , and that is not an idea which any state with any concern for animals , or for its human citizens , should wish to be prevalent .",,,
0, part of the ` attraction ' of bullfighting for crowds is witnessing death .,,,
0, advocates of the practice make this into an argument for the practice .,,,
0," but , a desire to see death in front of one 's own eye 's amounts to bloodlust .",,,
0, why should humans be accommodated in such a morbid pursuit ?,,,
0," eric gallego , an animal rights protester , said in: `` bullfighting is a bloody entertainment .",,,
0, we must stop this cruelty because we do n't want to be a barbaric society in europe . '',,,
0,"  this argument applies just as much to any other country in the world : why would we want to encourage people to enjoy pain and suffering , as we have laws which make causing pain and suffering illegal , both for humans and animals , in almost every other context ?",,,
0," bullfighting is therefore immoral , and encourages cruel and immoral behaviour in other areas , and so it should be banned .",,,
0, many matadors are gored each year .,,,
0," in, famed matador julio aparicio was gored in the throat by a bull during the festival of saint isidro .",,,
0, the bulls horn went through his neck and throat and up through his mouth .,,,
0," such gruesome scenes , and the risks that matadors must take with their lives , have no place in a modern society .",,,
0,  the culture and audience pressure of bullfighting actually increase the danger for matadors .,,,
0," the bullfighters perceived and praised as ` the best ' are the ones that come closest to the bull , letting its horns pass inches by the fighter 's side , etc, the greater the risk for the bullfighter , the greater the reward from the crowd .",,,
0, the bullfighter is not trying to stay as far away as possible in order to make a riskless kill ; they are trying to demonstrate their courage and bravery in the face of potentially fatal risks .,,,
0,"  in spain and most other countries with bullfighting , the horns of bulls are not shaved , but rather kept sharp , increasing the danger for the matador .",,,
0,"  the state bans many other kinds of activities on the grounds that they are harmful to the participants : taking narcotics is illegal , driving without a seatbelt is illegal , and in many countries even legal guns are required to be fitted with safety devices to protect the user .",,,
0," this is yet another instance where , if the state did not step in , individuals would enter into certain activities which would be harmful to them .",,,
0," the need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community , which may lead many of them to take risks , and suffer injuries , they otherwise would not , for fear of losing ` face ' .",,,
0," bullfighting is just too dangerous to humans to allow , and so the state should step in and ban bullfighting to protect all those involved .",,,

0," is it not the role of the state to reduce that discrimination , not to fuel it ?",,,
0, banning such creams would help prevent such harmful effects by discouraging the notion that people should aim to make themselves lighter skinned .,,,
