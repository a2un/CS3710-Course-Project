0,1,,"the term child performer includes young singers, actors, dancers, gymnasts, etc. these children are exceptions to theconvention concerning minimum age for admission to employment, and so may be paid for their work, as long as they have permits that “limit the number of hours during which and prescribe the conditions in which employment or work is allowed”.
",
1,1,," however, some feel that child performers ought not to be such an exception, and that it should be ensured that no child under the minimum age for admission to employment be allowed to partake in paid work of any kind.
",
2,1,,"currently, child performers are protected by various laws, for example laws which dictate how many hours the child may work and how much education they must receive (both of which vary by country), or how much of their pay must be reserved for the child themselves (e.g., canada’s “coogan law”).
",
3,1,," yet some believe these laws do not provide adequate protection, and that these child performers represent a group (and a group which is on the increase) whose rights are being undermined.
",
4,1,," a subset believes that the only way to protect these children completely is to ban child performers outright.
",
5,0,," spending so much time either performing or training limits the amount of formal education the child can receive .
",
6,0,," for example , in the uk and other countries , child performers are only required to be educated for three hours each day .
",
7,0,," additionally , the focus on the specialised skill of the child , e.g. , acting , dancing , etc. , may detract from their family 's or their own interest in formal education .
",
8,0,," children are generally considered to be too young to make important decisions for themselves , and so decision-making falls to parents , teachers , etc, for child performers , there are additional decision-makers : their agents .
",
9,0,," since agents benefit financially from the child 's getting a role or doing well in a sporting event , there is a definite risk of exploitation .
",
10,0,," exploitation can also come from parents , as in the famous case of american television child stars jackie coogan and gary coleman , who both sued their parents for spending the money they had earned as children or of macaulay culkin , who blocked his parents from having access to his earnings .
",
11,0,," even experienced adults can find it difficult to deal with stage fright or performance anxiety .
",
12,0,," children , more emotionally vulnerable than adults by nature , should not be exposed to this sort of pressure .
",
13,0,," this is especially true in situations where the child is being paid for their performance , since the added necessity to perform well can lead to even more pressure .
",
14,0,," although suicide among children is rare , it is believed often to occur as a result of the child feeling like she is under too much pressure , or failing to meet the expectations of others .
",
15,0,," there are also consequences that continue long past the child has stopped performing ; former child actors often have the problem as young adults as feeling as having already ` peaked ' and find themselves without a sense of drive or ambition or a coherent adult identity , consequentially they often suffer from substance abuse and addiction children involved at a professional level in sports are at a higher risk than their peers of physical problems like breaking bones .
",
16,0,," in some cases , these physical problems can be fatal ; e.g. , julissa gomez , who died from complications of a vaulting injury contracted when she wasin warm-ups for a gymnastics competition .
",
17,0,," even in careers like acting and dancing there are risks for child performers .
",
18,0,," actors and dancers are usually encouraged to stay thin , often to an unhealthy degree .
",
19,0,," because children are particularly vulnerable , they are more susceptible to the perils of over-exercising for athletes and eating disorders for performers .
",
20,0,," it has been found , for example , that girls who dance in their childhood are more likely than their peers to develop anorexia nervosa in later life .
",
21,0,," lena zavaroni , the childhood winner of ` opportunity knocks ' in the's , struggled with eating disorders for all of her life and died aged.
",
22,0,," with the damage eating disorders can do to a person 's body , it should be illegal to expose children to such risks .
",
23,0,," child performers are exposed to a much higher level of responsibility than their peers , without the maturity to deal with it .
",
24,0,," they may be exposed to sex , drugs , or alcohol , in a context too far removed from a normal life that they do n't learn adequate coping mechanisms .
",
25,0,," it is no surprise that many child performers `` burn out '' by the time they reach adulthood , often experiencing problems long before , as in the case of actress drew barrymore , who entered rehab at the age of.
",
26,0,," children should not be encouraged to enter into these adult worlds of acting , modeling , dancing , etc, michael jackson attributed his obsession with children and childhood as a consequence of having missed out on a childhood himself .
",
27,0,," child performers are currently protected by laws about all sorts of things from the minimum amount of education they may get to their pay and how many hours they can work .
",
28,0,," many of these laws would be much more difficult to enforce than a blanket ban .
",
29,0,," it would be simple to enforce as child performers would in most cases be easy to spot -- as they are performing for the public .
",
30,0,," the government could then bring charges against those who are employing the child and fine them .
",
31,1,,"in our globalized world with an increasingly international media, beauty standards for both men and women are becoming more internationalized - or, perhaps, westernized.
",
32,1,," this has included skin tone, with cultural values in many countries favouring lighter skin tones.
",
33,1,,"one particular aspect of this has been creams aiming to whiten skin.
",
34,1,," this is not an issue that affects women, the key target of much of the fashion and beauty industry, exclusively - some products are aimed at men.
",
35,1,," this is not a phenomenon unique to africa and communities of african origins.
",
36,1,," india is a large market for skin whitening creams, with a market worth just shy of half a billion us dollars inand growing at nearly 20% per year.
",
37,1,," in hong kong, around a third of women have used such products.
",
38,1,," the issue of people seeking to look “whiter” or caucasian is not limited to any area or simply skin whitening creams – there are also products and the possibility of surgery to mimic more european-looking eyelids available in east asia.
",
39,1,,"west africa is a key market for these products, with over half of women in togo and nigeria claiming to use them.
",
40,1,," while some contain chemicals aimed at modifying the skin’s transfer of melanin, others use harsh chemicals such as mercury, which can lead to medical conditions from eczema and infections to renal failure.
",
41,1,,"a particular controversy has been generated by the launch of a new skin whitening product in early 2014, known as “whitenicious”, by nigerian-cameroonian singer dencia, and her comments relating to the product, including a spat with actress lupita nyong’o. nyong’o, who shot to fame outside her native kenya following her powerful performance in the popular and well received british-american film “12 years a slave”, has been critical of skin lightening creams and the conception of lighter skin tones in african mind-sets.
",
42,1,," in 2006, the us food and drug administration proposed a ban on over-the-counter sales of skin whitening creams.
",
43,1,," is this a solution for africa?
",
44,0,," skin whitening creams often contain a wide variety of harmful ingredients -- in some cases , mercury .
",
45,0,," these can cause various health problems ; mercury in particular causes renal , kidney , damage , major skin problems as well as mental health issues .
",
46,0,," states , throughout the world , ban consumer products because they are harmful regardless of whether this is for consumption or for cosmetics .
",
47,0,," this is just another case where that is appropriate in order to prevent the harm to health that may occur .
",
48,0,," allowing the use of racial overtones -- the perception that a product will bring a person towards a `` white ideal '' is harmful for several reasons .
",
49,0,," it could cause communities to generate a form of inferiority complex , and it reinforces the structural difference rather than aiming to minimize it .
",
50,0,," while it may sound absurd , in the us darker-skinned african americans , and darker skinned latinos , are less well educated and have lower incomes .
",
51,0,," elsewhere in the western hemisphere , such as in brazil , race is seen as an issue of colour and socio-economic background , not ancestry highlighting a much more obvious link between whitening creams and racism .
",
52,0,," is it not the role of the state to reduce that discrimination , not to fuel it ?
",
53,0,," banning such creams would help prevent such harmful effects by discouraging the notion that people should aim to make themselves lighter skinned .
",
54,0,," skin whitening can be seen as an attempt to fit in with a form of a neo-colonialist mind-set ; a form of cultural imperialism driven by capitalism .
",
55,0,," these products , often sold by big international fmcg , fast moving consumer goods , companies feed off a neo-colonialist mind-set -- one of a cultural inferiority complex .
",
56,0,," these products form part of the process of tying african people into a globalised consumer world where non-westerners feel compelled to buy western products that they do n't need .
",
57,0,," they are therefore kept in a colonial situation where they are dependent on the west both mentally and in terms of the products they buy .
",
58,0,," that is reason enough for nations that have been victims of colonialism by the global north to take action against them .
",
59,1,,"the feminist movement is difficult to define.
",
60,1,," in essence, it is composed of people who adhere to an ideology, feminism, which originates from philosophical principles of equality.
",
61,1,," as such, they oppose any kind of dehumanisation or exploitation, in particular when targeted at women.
",
62,1,," in practice, feminists are particularly opposed to the existence of patriarchal structures in society and to the social construction of gender, as opposed to sex.
",
63,1,," this common ideology has led to some great successes for feminism in the past, such as women’s right to vote since the 19th or 20th centuries, or equal pay in most developed countries.
",
64,1,," (global wage report 2012/13: wages and equitable growth)it is important to note that the feminist movement is, however, severely fragmented on more nuances social questions.
",
65,1,," on particular issues such as prostitution or the burka, many feminists disagree as to what empowers women and what oppresses them, as to what liberates women because they do so freely, and what harms them because are pressured to do it by the patriarchy.
",
66,1,,"pornography is a particularly contentious issue.
",
67,1,," we take pornography to be any sexually explicit material, usually commercially distributed, acted or containing acting with the intention to arouse its viewers.
",
68,1,," it is currently legal in most liberal countries, although iceland, for instance, is attempting to ban it in the near future (henscher).
",
69,1,," where it is not yet illegal, it is under serious scrutiny: its currently immense role in society (over 70% of young men are estimated to watch porn at least once a month (paul)) gives it great leverage in promoting, or reverting, social change.
",
70,1,," social change, arguably, is the next key fight for the feminist movement.
",
71,1,," the question, then, comes down to whether pornography is a causal factor or a potential solution of the status quo of social oppression of women.
",
72,0,," in most cases , pornography is not entered into willingly .
",
73,0,," similarly to prostitution , the sale of one 's own body and one 's dignity is so drastic that consent is often not sufficiently informed to be legitimate .
",
74,0,," there are patriarchal structures in society that force women into these industries , particularly when they are vulnerable and this seems to be a good last resort .
",
75,0,," this leads to a loss of integrity , a strong stigma in society , and most importantly , abusive conditions in the production process .
",
76,0,," as well as high risks of unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases , violent sex practices and abusive conditions after filming often occur , lubben .
",
77,0,," furthermore , the harms of pornography do not exclusively affect the consenting participants .
",
78,0,," other women across the world who are not supporting this industry are equal victims of society and the norms promoted by pornography of how women should be , and how it is acceptable to treat them .
",
79,0,," these people have not consented .
",
80,0,," pornography necessarily objectifies people : it presents a sexual desire , an urge , which is immediately attended by another person , often performing acts which we would find demeaning , until the original urge is satisfied .
",
81,0,," the use of others for pleasure treats them as means to one 's own ends , and denies them any value as rational subjects with a will of their own .
",
82,0,," this affects , naturally , the participants in pornography , but also their viewers who adopt corrupted notions of what to value in others , and furthermore other women who are later affected by men using the same metric to interact with them .
",
83,0,," pornography presents a distorted perception of people , sexuality , and relationships , which has a further effect on a broader societal level .
",
84,0,," it promotes unreachable ideals of how both women and men should be in bed , and pushes both in the direction of what is idealised in pornography .
",
85,0,," this may push men to be more dominating than otherwise and women to suffer from anorexia , low self-esteem , and promiscuity .
",
86,0,," we can expect women to be the most affected by this , simply because the porn industry is owned almost entirely by men , and because there are pre-existing patriarchal structures in society ready to promote the idea that women are there to serve men .
",
87,0,," altogether , pornography merely promotes a new stereotype : that women are generally happy to have sex at any time , that they will respond positively to any man 's advances , and if a woman does not , there is something wrong with her .
",
88,0,," many forms of media are often accused of inciting violence , promoting stereotypes , or indoctrinating in some form or another .
",
89,0,," while this is contentious , the key principle that ` sex sells ' is more obvious .
",
90,0,," pornography is not like other media in that , while most other films are aimed at entertainment , this is aimed at arousal .
",
91,0,," that is , it is aimed at immediate and fully selfish pleasure , which is much more forceful and addictive than mere laughter .
",
92,0,," the psychological effect of pornography is harmful due to the associations it conditions its audience to make .
",
93,0,," it eroticises violence through portrayals , fake or genuine , of rape and a general treatment of women that is comparable to torture , yet presented in a context that necessarily biologically excites its viewers .
",
94,0,," through continuous exposure to the link between abuse and intense pleasure , this link is easily extended to personal relationships .
",
95,0,," the master-slave dialectic suddenly becomes acceptable .
",
96,0,," compulsive rapists , such as ted bundy , are often found to have consumed mass amounts of pornography , benson .
",
97,0,," more subtle , yet certainly still present is the force of such associations on young teenagers who have not yet had a sexual relationship and rely on pornography for guidance .
",
98,0,," this has a potentially massive impact given thatis the average age of first internet porn exposure , techmedia network .
",
99,1,,"many people's ideal christmas day involves snowy weather.
",
100,1,," christmas cards often feature snow- white landscapes, along with polar bears, penguins and other cuddly animals from arctic areas.
",
101,1,," christmas decorations and displays often involve fake snow or snowflake designs.
",
102,1,," and the song, ""i'm dreaming of a white christmas"", written by irving berlin inand sung by bing crosby sums up the christmas spirit in music for many people.
",
103,1,,"this wish for a white christmas is especially strong in parts of the world like western europe and much of the usa, where snow on december 25th is possible but actually quite unusual.
",
104,1,," in the uk there is a great deal of speculation in the media each year about the chances of snow on christmas day, and many bets are placed on the possibility.
",
105,1,," of course, in other parts of the northern hemisphere they expect snow for several months of the year, and so it is not such a big deal.
",
106,1,," this case is most relevant to those places like the uk and much of the usa where a white christmas cannot be taken for granted.
",
107,0,," however, it also has relevance in many other countries, including even sunny australia.
",
108,0,,"the ideal of a white christmas also speaks to the old pagan festivals .
",
109,0,," the winter solstice , yule , saturnalia , was a time of hope in the cold and darkness , as nights stopped getting longer and people looked for the promise of new birth in springtime .
",
110,0,," the christian church recognized the power of existing winter festivals and chose december 25th for their own nativity celebrations .
",
111,0,," people still feel a need to move in time with the seasons , and snow represents winter at its most extreme .
",
112,0,," for these reasons the dream of a white christmas satisfies a need deep within us .
",
113,0,," we all love the traditional white christmas .
",
114,0,," when we think of christmas we see snowy scenes , with people skating and sledging , and children making snowballs and snowmen .
",
115,0,," later the families gather inside around a warm fire to celebrate .
",
116,0,," this is the sort of christmas shown on greeting cards and celebrated in so many songs , for example , white christmas , jingle bells , frosty the snowman , walking in a winter wonderland , etc. .
",
117,0,," it is n't a proper christmas without snow .
",
118,0,," `` the interest in snowy christmases has its origins in the colder climate of the period--when britain was in the grip of a ` little ice age '  that way , the traditional image was created .
",
119,0,," for most people christmas today is not about a religious festival , but about consumption , greed and shopping .
",
120,0,," wishing for a snowy white christmas is about turning the clock back to a time when life was simpler .
",
121,0,," instead of focusing on getting presents , getting fat and getting drunk , a white christmas is something money ca n't buy .
",
122,0,," it symbolizes time with family , playing outdoors in the snow , making your own entertainment and enjoying the wonder of nature .
",
123,0,," who would n't prefer a christmas like that ?
",
124,1,,"modern nations such as australia, canada, and the united states have struggled in their efforts to establish a fair and stable relationship with aboriginal, or indigenous, groups.
",
125,1,," in the past three hundred years, the aforementioned governments have often abused these groups through unfair and broken treaties, reckless dissemination of disease, and often direct violence.
",
126,1,," consequently, these groups make up a small portion of the population today and are often plagued by problems with substance abuse and poor quality of life.
",
127,1,," governments also struggle to establish a fair level of jurisdiction over said groups; while these nation-states recognize that indigenous groups were forced to submit to the government's authority, they are not willing to let indigenous groups break any law they dislike.
",
128,1,," this centers on the question of whether governments should act to preserve indigenous culture; this protection can take the form of land reservations set aside for aboriginals.
",
129,1,," however, it can also include language programs or funding for the arts so that, despite heavy losses in numbers over the generations, the remainder of these indigenous groups is able to pass down their culture.
",
130,1,," protection of indigenous culture may also include special legal exemption from particular laws that are contrary to indigenous traditions.
",
131,0,," while many argue that aboriginals are entitled to special treatment because of a blemished past, others argue that this past is not a valid reason for special cultural protection.
",
132,0,,"across the united states , australia , and canada , native customs are often tied closely to the land .
",
133,0,," for example , while descendants of the sioux indians of the american midwest may no longer hunt buffalo , learning about traditional means of hunting , animal use , rituals involving the surrounding wildlife , means of ensuring a sustainable food supply , and other cultural norms related to the land gives people a greater appreciation for the land they now inhabit .
",
134,0,," exposure to traditions that have been practiced in one 's land for thousands of years helps us to appreciate the legacy we have inherited .
",
135,0,," this does not just benefit the direct descendants of those practicing these traditions but the whole of society .
",
136,0,," the indian removal act of, theindian appropriations act , and thegeneral allotment act are just a few examples of legislation used to destroy native american communities in the us2 .
",
137,0,," settlers in australia are similarly responsible for a multitude of massacres3 , as well as several decades of forced separation of aboriginal children from their parents in an effort to `` christianize '' them4 .
",
138,0,," while the current citizens of canada , the us , and australia are not guilty of the crimes of their predecessors , they nevertheless reap the benefits of those atrocities while today 's indigenous populations still suffer from the lasting impact of oppression .
",
139,0,," when chemical companies make huge profits at the expense of damaging the surrounding community 's environment , those companies are expected to pay reparations .
",
140,0,," a government that destroys an indigenous culture must similarly work to reverse their destruction .
",
141,0,," notions of cultural superiority virtually always influence displacement and abuse of indigenous cultures .
",
142,0,," for example , when the government of botswana expelled the kalahari bushmen from their land in, president mogai defended his actions by describing the bushmen as `` stone age creatures .
",
143,0,," ``this cultural insensitivity , in addition to the incentive of material gains , led the botswani government to violate the tribe 's rights .
",
144,0,," by preserving indigenous culture , governments recognize the value of these groups and prevent future hostility .
",
145,0,," governments already protect culture so it is not a big step to apply the same protections to aboriginal culture as well .
",
146,0,," in school , students learn about traditional art and their national history .
",
147,0,," for example , the state of california compiles reading lists that largely include shakespeare , virgil , and john steinback , though also including ethnic authors like maya angelou1 .
",
148,0,," governments recognize days like christmas and new years and fund programs that promote the arts .
",
149,0,," states recognize marriage and structure divorce and custody laws based on cultural norms of gender roles and family responsibility .
",
150,0,," if a government can protect the norms on one culture in society , there is no reason that the government should not also protect the culture of those who first inhabited the land .
",
151,0,," this current protection makes it easy to build on , to make highlight more aboriginal culture , recognize their festivals etc,
",
152,1,,"for many people, santa claus is the most important person in the celebration of christmas.
",
153,1,," his origins are disputed, with many recognising him as st nicholas, an early christian saint noted for his generosity and love for children.
",
154,1,," others view him as a descendant of northern european gods and spirits from the pre-christian past.
",
155,1,," in britain (and australia and other commonwealth countries) he is traditionally called father christmas, but santa’s red suit, big white beard and large belly are now widely recognised all over the world.
",
156,1,," although other details vary, experts also agree that santa claus lives at the north pole where he and a workforce of elves spend the year producing toys.
",
157,1,," on christmas eve santa hitches up reindeer to a magical sleigh which lets him fly around the world in one night, delivering presents to children everywhere - often descending to their bedrooms via the chimney.
",
158,0,,"surprisingly, there are some sceptics and kill-joys who raise doubts about santa claus, questioning his relevance to a christian festival celebrating christ’s birth, his involvement in the commercialisation of christmas, and even santa’s very existence.
",
159,0,,"there is plenty of evidence for the existence of santa claus .
",
160,0,," millions of children worldwide wake up on christmas morning to find that their stocking has been magically filled with toys and candy overnight .
",
161,0,," everybody agrees that it was santa who was responsible - and surely if it was anyone else they would want to take credit for their generosity .
",
162,0,," further evidence can be found in the way in which cookies , mince pies and drinks left out for santa have been consumed in the night - often leaving crumbs .
",
163,0,," `` yes , virginia , there is a santa claus .
",
164,0,," he exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist , and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy .
",
165,0,," alas !
",
166,0,," how dreary would be the world if there were no santa claus !
",
167,0,," it would be as dreary as if there were no virginias .
",
168,0,," there would be no childlike faith then , no poetry , no romance to make tolerable this existence .
",
169,0,," we should have no enjoyment , except in sense and sight .
",
170,0,," the external light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished . ''
",
171,0,," written in answer to a child 's letter by francis pharcellus church and published in the new york sun 's editorial page in.
",
172,0,,"  billions of people across the world believe in santa claus , and so many people ca n't be wrong .
",
173,0,," what 's more , a belief which was once confined to the anglo-saxon world is becoming more and more widespread .
",
174,0,," if chinese and south american children are coming to accept the existence of santa claus , then why should we in the western world give up our belief ?
",
175,0,," belief in santa claus is also economically necessary .
",
176,0,," without santa to set an example of generosity , gift-giving at christmas could go out of fashion .
",
177,0,," and once you take santa out of christmas , what else would be stripped away - christmas trees , lights , tinsel , christmas dinner ?
",
178,0,," huge sectors of our economy depend on belief in santa claus , from the department store grottoes to the entertainment industry , from toy shops and manufacturers to the makers of wrapping paper , stockings , red hats with bobbles on , etc, trust is the basis of all economic exchange , and the consequences of doubt in santa claus , in terms of bankruptcies , closures , unemployment and stock market and currency slumps are too awful to imagine .
",
179,0,," belief in santa claus is outdated and rather worrying .
",
180,0,," who today has a chimney through which to send a burning message to santa , and through which he can descend to distribute presents ?
",
181,0,," who wears stockings rather than socks or pantyhose ?
",
182,0,," and who thinks an old white male is a relevant role model in today 's society ?
",
183,0,," there is also something rather sinister today about having a stranger enter children 's rooms at night , or having them whispering secrets to him while seated on his lap in a store .
",
184,0,," finally , santa claus with his saintly origins alienates those of other faiths who do not enjoy being forced to join in a quasi-christian celebration .
",
185,1,,"violence against women is one of the most widespread human rights abuses affecting the world today.
",
186,1,," every day, thousands of women and girls are abused and murdered by their families, raped in armed conflicts and attacked for defending woman's rights1.
",
187,1,," many believe there are still violent undercurrents, such as the depiction of violence towards women in some music, which have not allowed women to be truly free from detrimental social norms.
",
188,1,," simply stating that vaw (violence against women) is wrong and dealing with situations one by one as they occur is no longer an option as it is such a widespread phenomenon.
",
189,1,," violence against women in music is now a global phenomenon, and is common in many of the world's most famous artists.
",
190,1,," the problem has become even more widespread thanks to the advancements in technology, and in particular the internet which allows the access and sharing of this style of music all over the world.
",
191,1,," while in most countries films (and to an extent tv shows) are given age ratings such as universal, 12a or r in order to suggest what age group are mature enough to deal with its content, however, so far such a rating system has not been created for music, meaning people of all ages are exposed to many violent images they would not have access to via other forms of media.2 yet music videos depicting violence towards women exist and are often unrated, such as eminem and rhianna's 'love the way you lie'1.
",
192,1,," this, combined with the ever increasing use of the internet to obtain and share music, shows that there are inconsistencies between the expectations and restrictions put on music and music videos and the expectations and restrictions placed on other forms of media.
",
193,1,," also due to common ownership of mp3 players, radios and computing equipment it is harder than ever to keep track of what music children/ young people are listening too.
",
194,1,," often genres such as rap and hip-hop are blamed for these misogynistic lyrics, but there are a huge range of songs depicted violence against women from rap to rock to county, and in america, france, the uk and many more (see scrapbook for examples).
",
195,1,," the discussion of whether music depicting violence against women should be banned creates a platform so that we can begin to discuss if all music depicting any crimes should be banned.
",
196,1,,"note: in order to illustrate the examples of violent language towards women in music involves directly quoting from the original source.
",
197,1,," in many cases this means the examples contain strong and violent language that some may find offensive.
",
198,0,," however, it seems necessary to keep this language intact in order to properly quote from the source, and also in order to illustrate the extreme nature of violence towards women that is prevalent in these songs.
",
199,0,,"while music depicting violence towards women appears on the surface to only demean women , it can be offensive and degrading to a range of people .
",
200,0,," one popular culture reference to a situation like this comes from the british television show called the office , in the episode ` merger '.
",
201,0,," in this episode the character david brent tells a racist joke and while this did not offend the black character present , many other characters were still offended by this joke .
",
202,0,," people may be offended by the ideas behind the music , as it seems that people who glorify violence towards women in song appear to think that this violence is acceptable .
",
203,0,," men could be offended by these ideas just as much as women might .
",
204,0,," as songs like this become ` mainstream ' in some cultures , everybody in that culture becomes affected by it , and some men and women may feel degraded by this association .
",
205,0,," finally some people may argue that the person who writes and/or sings lyric that depict violence towards women degrade themselves in this act .
",
206,0,," music depicting violence to women causes and sustains the cycle of violence .
",
207,0,," the scottish home affairs correspondent lucy adams reported inthe levels of domestic abuse committed by 16-18 year olds grew by around% .
",
208,0,," one of the reasons suggested for this dramatic raise is the culture of music that depicts and glorifies violence towards women , heraldscotland.com .
",
209,0,," journal of personality and social psychology reports that a study conducted in a variety of us states illustrated that music that depicted acts of violence ` led to more aggressive interpretations of ambiguously aggressive words , increased the relative speed with which people read aggressive vs. nonaggressive words ... , the violent songs increased feelings of hostility without provocation or threat ' .
",
210,0,," although they are quick to assure that it is not the music type that has this affect , it is simply the lyrics , as even humorous aggressive songs have this effect .
",
211,0,," they conclude with the idea that ` repeated exposure to violent lyrics may contribute to the development of an aggressive personality ' and thus lead to more aggressive behaviour .
",
212,0,," while currently there is little to no research specifically on the link between domestic violence and lyrics that depict abuse to women , the current information that we have on violence and music lyrics suggests we can expect a similar effect .
",
213,0,," thus if we were to ban music depicting violence towards women , people could not be influenced by it and levels of violence would drop .
",
214,0,," we already give films , dvd 's and games an age appropriate rating .
",
215,0,," in the united states , the motion picture association of america is charged with the responsibility of providing ratings to consumers .
",
216,0,," it would seem that it would be simple to stretch these criteria to a similar music body .
",
217,0,," therefore people would only be subjected to violent lyrics when it is deemed they are old enough to hear or buy this material , and it would stop younger people from being exposed to this kind of music .
",
218,0,," this also means that no new state-run institution needs to be created ; it would operate , like the mpaa , independently of government control .
",
219,0,," as such , claims that any form of music censorship would suffer from practical problems are short-sighted , we simply need to extend the medium that already exists .
",
220,0,," asha jennings began a boycott of misogynistic music in hip-hop , resulting in the ` take back the music ' campaign supported by essence magazine .
",
221,0,," jennings claims that this type of rap / hip hop music is ` telling people , black women , are bitches and hos and sluts and not worthy of respect ... , and that 's exactly how society is treating us '.
",
222,0,," she continues that images of women ` tends to be objectified , degrading , very stripper-like ' or as nagging vicious and manipulative money grabbers1 .
",
223,0,," jennings ' worry is that in these videos women are depicted as menial , subservient and purely as the object of men 's entertainment .
",
224,0,," the lyrics that go with these music videos compound these ideas of women as undeserving of male respect e.g. ` would n't piss on fire to put you out ' , eminem , ` then i straight smoked the ho ... , and she thanked me ' , nwe , all lyrics in full are in the scrapbook .
",
225,0,," these images in themselves are violence towards women , as they dehumanise them .
",
226,0,," as this becomes a dominant image in society , young people who look up to these rappers mimic their behaviour and believe it is ok to disrespect women ,2 as that is what they have been exposed to .
",
227,0,," this works in the same way for young girls , who can not relate to the male rappers and so instead mimic the women they talk about , while also following their views on women .
",
228,0,," this idea that women are not deserving of respect must affect the levels of violence towards women as if you abuse someone you can not fully respect them .
",
229,0,," therefore if music depicting violence , and for this argument , disrespect , towards women was banned , then violence towards women in the real world would be reduced and this must be seen as a good thing .
",
230,1,,"english has in the 20th century become the global language; it is the language of trade, diplomacy and the internet.
",
231,1,," english hasmillion mother tongue speakers in the world, and anothermillion second tongue speakers.
",
232,1,," there have been many 'lingua franca' languages before, greek in the ancient world then latin in the christian world until the seventeenth century and more recently french.
",
233,1,," however these languages have always been the language of the elite.
",
234,1,," english is both much more wide spread geographically and is not just an elite language so is having a much bigger effect and is in a much better position to become a single language for everyone.
",
235,1,," but is its marginalisation of other lesser, regional languages, a good thing?
",
236,1,," the advance of english is resisted within many cultures who see language as an essential component of identity as well as a key tool for accessing the history and literatures of individual peoples (george orwell explored this theme in his novelwith newspeak, a language created with the purpose to suppress a population's thoughts), yet others believe one global language would be useful; in fact l. l. zamenhof created esperanto specifically for this purpose at the end of the 19th century (although esperanto never really gained ground as a language in its own right).
",
237,0,," should everyone be taught english as to make the language the only one globally?
",
238,0,,"integration is something that is already happening due to the existence of creoles .
",
239,0,," bryson  states that , `` according to dr loreto todd of leeds university , the world has sixty-one creoles , languages that are a mix of two different ones , such as the many different pidgins spoken around the world , spoken by up tomillion people . ''
",
240,0,," creole languages are the ultimate form of language integration , and most would argue that this is n't language death , and can in fact enhance the culture through the new language .
",
241,0,," the united nations already has universal education high up the priority list .
",
242,0,," the second millennium development goal is to achieve universal primary education and to ` ensure that , by, children everywhere , boys and girls alike , will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling ' .
",
243,0,," universal schooling is the key to teaching a global language .
",
244,0,," this does not mean that children will be forced to learn a global language , but because of the utility of the language most will want to when they are given the opportunity .
",
245,0,," the global spread of english encourages non-native speakers to learn a second language ; english .
",
246,0,," without english , a second language would only slightly increase the number of people you could communicate with .
",
247,0,," with english , or , if it ever takes off , esperanto !
",
248,0,," , there is a stronger incentive to learn the single language that will dramatically improve your ability to communicate with others around the world .
",
249,0,," poetry and other significant literary works could be translated into english so that everyone can enjoy them .
",
250,0,," this would be equally true of scientific and technical information as well as teaching staff and institutions .
",
251,0,," most popular classical works are translated into other languages without loss of meaning e.g. poems of robert burns from the original scots into english .
",
252,0,," and why would we purposely want to make it difficult for people to understand each other ?
",
253,0,," surely understanding each other is more important than learning about their culture but not being able to converse whatsoever .
",
254,0,," this would have immense benefits for science as researchers all over the world would be able to understand each other 's work .
",
255,0,," translation is very expensive , but while there is no common language also necessary .
",
256,0,," all sorts of documents have to be translated into several languages even within countries , for example uk councils provide information on their activities in the major minority languages within their area .
",
257,0,," with a global language this will be cheaper and quicker as well as reducing the potential for misunderstanding .
",
258,0,," the european union is the big example of this with all documents needing to be translated into every member state 's language .
",
259,0,," the total bill for the eu in translation fees was $million in, that 's $per citizen1 .
",
260,1,,"as concern for gender equality continues around the world, so do the concerns in how women and children are portrayed and perceived in an ever increasing international media.
",
261,1,," since advertising carries those messages, images of women continue to come under scrutiny.
",
262,1,," in may of 2011, the council of europe parliamentary assembly received a report from its committee on equal opportunities for women and children which discussed the nature of this problem and called for action regarding sexist advertising.
",
263,1,," these portrayals of women are believed by opponents to sexist advertising to present unrealistic beauty standards and often objectify women.
",
264,1,," these opponents argue stereotypic images are contributing to harmful effects such as eating disorders and violence against women.
",
265,1,," one primary focus in this dialogue is whether responses should be made which interfere with business practices.
",
266,1,," what is the nature of the marketplace?
",
267,1,," should business be monitored and censured?
",
268,1,," how or could appropriate criteria for judgement be established?
",
269,1,,"advertising is the promotion of good and services through public messages.
",
270,1,," sexism can be defined as discrimination based on gender or attitudes which promote stereotyping of social roles based on gender.
",
271,1,," sexist advertising, then, is the promotion of goods or services which stereotype women and men based on gender.
",
272,1,," banning refers to the public restriction of a particular action to achieve a desired goal.
",
273,1,,"despite the fact that the particular circumstances of government funding for the arts will vary from country to country and should be researched carefully, the principles for this debate remain universal.
",
274,1,," in an age of global economic difficulty the fundamental question is whether or not public money in any form should subsidise arts projects which are not self-sufficient.
",
275,1,," in looking at this question, 'the arts' as a term should include museums and galleries as well as theatre, literature, music and film - all of these things are currently supported by government funding in the uk.1 as well as looking at whether or not these projects should receive any money at all, there is also the question of what form of subsidy these projects should take - for example, is funding via a state lottery more acceptable than direct grants from the national treasury?
",
276,1,," ultimately any decision will be based in no small part on how far each individual values the concept of cultural output over more pragmatically valuable areas - whether or not people feel that in the modern world it is justifiable to use the limited resources available to not only foster new artistic projects, but also to protect the cultural heritage of the past.
",
277,1,," there is a natural comparison within this question between the european and american systems.
",
278,1,," in europe the majority of funding comes from government grants, where as in america there is a more competitive atmosphere in which projects must win favour with wealthy citizens and businesses who donate private funds.
",
279,1,," even in the united states some money is given by the federal government through the national endowment for the arts which gave $139million in 2010.2 the director of the tate modern, sir nicholas serota, argues that ""the key is the american culture of giving.
",
280,0,," people who have made money there are expected to give some of it back to society""3 it has however been suggested that it would be impossible to implement such a system in europe,4 and if that is indeed the case, the emphasis must shift to how far that system could reinforce the established governmental policies in europe.
",
281,0,,"if we accept the term ` arts ' to cover museums , galleries , theatres and musical and film projects , then it is clear that without public funding in many countries a large proportion of arts organisations would be lost .
",
282,0,," taking the uk as a prime example of what happens when funding for the arts is cut , we can see that of thecompanies which applied for funding from arts council england inonlywere successful .
",
283,0,," a cut of # 100m has meant this number has dropped from theorganisations that were granted funding in the previous application process1 .
",
284,0,," the arts council is responsible for the funding of cultural venues , theatres , galleries and performing arts groups , and this cut to its budget demonstrates the depth of repercussions that occur when the arts cease to be subsidised .
",
285,0,," there is also evidence to suggest that the american system of philanthropic donations simply does n't work in the uk , as investment in the arts by the business sector was shown in figures released in januaryto have fallen by%.
",
286,0,," 1alan davey  accessed 31/5/11 .
",
287,0,," 2bbc news  accessed 31/5/11 .
",
288,0,," since the lottery began in britain in1994 over #billion has been given to ` good causes ' .
",
289,0,," last year  16.67 % of the donations made were to arts organisations , the same amount that was given to sport and heritage projects1 .
",
290,0,," this money makes up an significant part of many organisation 's budgets , and stopping this funding whilst still giving to sports and heritage foundations would be discriminatory and unfair .
",
291,0,," equal distribution of this public lottery is the only way to ensure that people are being fairly treated when they buy their lottery ticket , even though the ` good causes ' their money goes to may not be their primary concern .
",
292,0,," 1the national lottery , accessed 31/5/11 .
",
293,0,," the reduction in available services would make arts less accessible to all , and although the demand would still be there , forcing companies to ensure they make a profit will drive ticket prices up and prevent those from poorer backgrounds from being able to enjoy the same cultural experiences as those who are wealthy .
",
294,0,," subsidy can ensure that cheaper tickets are available and that the arts remain democratically open to all , regardless of income or social class .
",
295,0,," it also allows other public institutions which have similar economic problems such as schools and colleges to provide better services for their students , giving them access to better teaching resources and therefore a better quality of education .1 it would be unfair and inaccurate to assume that the benefits of arts subsidy only go to the wealthy elite , as the focus is on providing arts projects for all members of society .
",
296,0,," free and cheap access to the arts is crucial for education .
",
297,0,," without subsidy schools and young people would not be able to take affordable music lessons , visit museums or galleries , or to attend plays or concerts , and would thereby be prevented from understanding and enjoying their culture fully .
",
298,0,," as well as being important for personal enrichment , access to the arts also makes the young aware of their cultural heritage both nationally and in world terms , increasing the likelihood of continued interest in the arts and its creation in the future .
",
299,1,,"christmas is traditionally seen as a christian religious festival whereby the birth of jesus is celebrated, it is celebrated by christians annually around the entire world, however it presence as a festival is arguably strongest in the western world where christianity was historically and still tends to be the dominant religion.
",
300,1,," however, many western nations are, like no other time before, much more multicultural with communities no longer being entirely christian but being made-up of an elaborate mix of belief systems such as hinduism, sikhism or even atheism to name but a few.
",
301,1,," many religions as well as christianity also celebrate festivals around the winter period and those which belong to belief systems that do not have events around christmas time still often join in with the festivities in a non-religious capacity, this has led to some people and organizations rather than wishing people merry christmas, which is a religious specific, to using greetings such as happy holidays.
",
302,1,," as a result there is an accusation claiming that this change in language is ""de-christianizing"" christmas; media copy around this argument is now annual fodder for news organizations with many claiming that christmas has been banned; stories can, for example, range from primary schools in britain choosing not to stage a traditional nativity play, to american public authorities not being allowed to put up a crib display, and public displays of festive lights being renamed ""winterval"", ""winter lights"" or ""luminos"".
",
303,1,," so if christmas is no longer a christian festival, should western states effectively ban it in public spaces and replace christmas celebrations with generic celebrations of the holiday season?
",
304,1,,"the power that advertising, and media more generally, wields has been and will continue to be an area of debate for years to come.
",
305,1,," advertising is largely, particularly in the western world, an inescapable phenomena; from the moment we wake up to the time we sleep advertisements bombard us.
",
306,1,," estimates of the amount advertisements people are exposed to on a daily basis ranges vastly from an arguably modestto anywhere up-to around 3,000 messages per day.1one of the main contentions regarding the issue is the argument to what degree, if at all, children can critically engage with advertising and whether or not it is ethical to allow corporate interests to try and change the perceptions and behavior of the young.
",
307,1,," there is undeniably a great deal of advertising on television currently which is aimed at children, promoting not only toys and sweets but also products such as food, drink, music, films and clothing to young consumers from toddlers to teenagers.
",
308,1,," increasingly this practice is coming under attack from parents' organizations, politicians and pressure groups in many countries.
",
309,1,," the uk, sweden, ireland, greece, italy, denmark and belgium all currently impose national restrictions, and these have also been proposed in most other eu countries and in the usa.
",
310,1,," within europe, the eu audiovisual media services directive has been in place since the end ofand places further restrictions on advertising to children, while also stressing the role of self-regulation among industry groups.
",
311,0,," can advertising towards children be justified, is it ethical to shield them from a phenomena which is pervasive in global culture and is arguably something they need to learn about or should children be protected from advertising messages aimed at influencing their behavior for the benefit of business.
",
312,0,,"advertising aimed at children brings negative social consequences , as much of it is for food and drinks that are very unhealthy with james rouse1 stating that in the us over $billion is spent annually advertising fast food towards children .
",
313,0,," encouraging gullible children to consume so much fatty , sugary and salty food is unethical because it creates obese , unhealthy youngsters , with bad eating habits that will be with them for life .
",
314,0,," society also has to pay a high price in terms of the extra medical care such children will eventually require , so the government has a direct interest in preventing advertisements which contribute to this problem .
",
315,0,," advertising specifically to children is unethical because they have little or no money of their own and have to persuade their parents to buy the products for them .
",
316,0,," rather than advertising directly to parents , companies use a `` nag and whine '' campaign that leads to hostility between parents and children .
",
317,0,," they rely on pester power to make adults spend money they do n't have on things they do n't want to buy , and which their children may well only play with for a few hours for example .
",
318,0,," advertising which presents products to children as `` must-have '' is also socially divisive , making children whose parents can not afford them appear inferior , and creating feelings of frustration and inadequacy , as well as leading families into debt .1 there is a good precedent for banning advertising aimed at children in the restrictions placed in most countries upon advertising tobacco and alcohol .
",
319,0,," it also takes a stand against increasingly exploitative marketing campaigns that ruthlessly target children .
",
320,0,," in the usa marketing companies are already offering schools free televisions in exchange for their students being forced to watch a certain amount of programming and advertisements each day , and selling marketing data on those children .
",
321,0,," it is time that childhood was protected from such commercialization .
",
322,0,," such a ban would be limited such as being only preventing advertising aimed at children rather than an outright attempt to stop children from seeing adverts .
",
323,0,," companies could therefore still advertise their children 's products if they aim their adverts at the parents rather than the children .
",
324,0,," alternatively the ban could be preventing advertising at times when children are most likely to be watching the television as has happened in sweden .1 advertising towards children can not be considered ethical as children have not yet fully developed their mental cognition .
",
325,0,," they lack the complete toolset to view advertising critically and advertisers take advantage of this , disregarding any negative effects it may have on children and society more generally .
",
326,0,," what must be remembered is advertising is sometimes much more subtle than commercial breaks on television .
",
327,0,," it can be found in many more places ; advertisers target children in schools , online with content such as product-branded games and also via product placement to name but a few examples .
",
328,0,," these types of advertising are much harder for children to be critical of as they are less overt ; with product placement even often evading the direct attention of adult viewers .
",
329,0,," in a consultation by the royal college of nursing1 , regarding product placement , it is stated that `` children are already susceptible to advertising messages and may not have the media literacy required to recognize adverts which take place during programming '' what this amounts to then is manipulation of children who are vulnerable to such messages .
",
330,0,," trying to get children to become `` cradle-to-grave '' customers is highly unethical .
",
331,1,,"advertising has grown to be an industry worth many billions of dollars across the world.
",
332,1,," online advertising alone is believed to be worth $24 billion a year1.
",
333,1,," almost all public space has some advertisements in sight and all forms of media, from newspapers to the cinema, are also filled with adverts.
",
334,1,," whilst this helps companies sell their products, and helps consumers to learn what is on offer, many believe that this huge amount of advertising can be harmful.
",
335,1,," it may make people want too much, or things that they cannot have, or it might make them feel inadequate when they don't have something.
",
336,0,," research shows that children can be particularly open to these kinds of risk.
",
337,0,,"the sheer volume of advertising in our society is incredible .
",
338,0,," you can not watch television , ride on a bus or even walk down the street without someone trying to sell you something or inform you of something .
",
339,0,," recent research suggests people living in a city today sees up to 5,000 advertisements a day1 .
",
340,0,," 50 % of those surveyed said they thought ` advertising today was out of control '.
",
341,0,," people should n't have to go about their lives having their minds saturated with such a vast quantity of , in most cases , redudant and profiteering information .
",
342,0,," they should be able to go about their daily lives in peace without being forced to watch , listen or view an advertisement .
",
343,0,," advertising leads to many people being overwhelmed by the endless need to decide between competing demands on their attention -- this is known as the tyranny of choice or choice overload .
",
344,0,," recent research suggests that people are on average less happy than they wereyears ago - despite being better off and having much more choice of things to spend their money on1 .
",
345,0,," the claims of adverts crowd in on people , raising expectations about a product and leading to inevitable disappointment after it is bought .
",
346,0,," a recent advertisement for make-up was banned in britain due to the company presenting its product as being more effective than it actually was2 .
",
347,0,," shoppers feel that a poor purchase is their fault for not choosing more wisely , and regret not choosing something else instead .
",
348,0,," some people are so overwhelmed that they can not choose at all .
",
349,0,," 1schwartz , the tyranny of choice ,.
",
350,0,," people can not just choose to ignore advertising , because advertisers use many underhand methods to get their message across .
",
351,0,," posters have attention grabbing words , or provocative pictures .
",
352,0,," some adverts today are even being hidden in what seem like pieces or art or public information so people do n't realise they are being marketed to .
",
353,0,," the introduction of digital screens allows businesses to alter their advertising to respond to specific events , making advertisements not only everywhere , but seemingly all-knowing1 .
",
354,0,," by targeting people 's unconscious thoughts adverts are a form of brainwashing that take away people 's freedoms to make choices .
",
355,0,," many adverts do more than just advertising products .
",
356,0,," some try to make people feel inferior if they do n't have the product , or if they have something which the product would change .
",
357,0,," perceptions of beauty and fashion in particular have been terribly distorted .
",
358,0,," many young people have low self-esteem , and lead unhealthy lifestyles because they feel they should be thinner and more attractive like the models they see in adverts .
",
359,0,," this leads to serious problems like eating-disorders and self-harm .
",
360,0,," research that proved this effect also concluded that ` the media can boost self-esteem , happiness with one 's self , where it is providing examples of a variety of body shapes .
",
361,0,," however , it often tends to portray a limited , small , number of body shapes '.
",
362,0,," advertising gives the impression , especially to children , that they can and should have everything they want .
",
363,0,," this makes people too interested in material things .
",
364,0,," people are becoming more selfish and obsessed with their possessions , and losing their values of patience , hard work , moderation and the importance of non-material things like family and friends .
",
365,0,," this harms their relationships and their personal development , which has serious effects for society as a whole .
",
366,1,,"english is the language of the superpower that is america, the internet and of computers.
",
367,1,," therefore, it is not uncommon to see and hear european languages laden with anglicisms.
",
368,1,," this english influence over french words is known as franglais.
",
369,1,," this word itself is a fusion of français and anglais, the french words for french and english.
",
370,1,," examples of this franglais are le parking (car park), un walkman (as opposed to the french term un balladeur) and un post-it (a post-it note).
",
371,1,," other european languages have been similarly affected by english.
",
372,1,," the german, spanish and welsh counterparts of franglais are known as deuglish, spanglish and wenglish.
",
373,1,,"franglais is that breed of french words that are heavily influenced by the english language; faire le shopping (translated literally means to do shopping) is commonly used instead of faire les magasins (translated literally means to do the shops).
",
374,1,," un relooking is used for make over and is a franglais term which has not been established by simply importing an english word into french and leaving it unchanged, such as le fast food.
",
375,1,," instead, rather creatively, un relooking has been created using the tools of english phraseology to form a word that does not even exist in english!
",
376,1,," in french, this prevalence of english influences is perhaps no greater than in other european languages, but is doubtless met with more animosity.
",
377,1,," in march 2006, the then french president jacques chirac addressed the eu in english.
",
378,1,," this move was not only met with great hostility from the french public, it prompted a walkout protest from the french ministers in attendance.
",
379,1,," they doubtless labelled this an act of anglo-snobberie, (sic) the french derogatory term for franglais, practiced only by anglosnobs (sic).
",
380,1,," this would certainly be the view taken by defense de la langue française, a body which wants to eliminate the use of franglais and to promote the french language.
",
381,1,,"is the franglais a playful use of words or is it an erosion of the french language?
",
382,1,," does the state have the right to tell the individual which lexicon they may and may not use?
",
383,1,," is franglais simply a counterpart to the anglophone use of gallicisms?
",
384,1,," languages change and have always changed; is it futile to try and intervene with such a natural occurrence?
",
385,1,," or do these views turn a blind eye to the emotive issue of protecting the french language from absorbing too much english?
",
386,1,," it is surely necessary to further protect the french language in light of anglicisms by handing more power to the défense de a langue française.
",
387,1,," this move would increase the protection of the french language.
",
388,1,," the défense de la languae française has the power to set and increase the quota of french language songs played on the radio at peak hours and to think up alternative, more french-sounding words for technological appliances tht are generally known by their english names even in french homes.
",
389,1,," such measures would stop the anglo influence that reigns on the french language, seemingly through new technology and modern equipment.
",
390,1,," in order to really protect the french language against english influences, this issue of language protection will have to be promoted.
",
391,1,,"  that is to say, the french people must be in sympathy with it to a certain degree already.
",
392,0,," however, if the use of anglicisms is so great because the french are happy using english –influenced language, is this a complete waste of time?
",
393,0,,"franglais has connotations of english and french conflict such as the norman conquest and the hundred years ' war and is a mark of disrespect and impertinence towards the french .
",
394,0,," therefore , for the french culture to be immersed in this is ridiculous and immoral and the french people deserve to have their language protected against it .
",
395,0,," for example , as explained by nicholas ridley , winston churchill addressed general de gaulle during the second world war with an unrefined franglias-ridden threat ; `` monsieur le general , markez vous mes mots .
",
396,0,," si vous me doublecrosserez , je vous liquidaterai '' , sic !
",
397,0,," , in this quotation , which is not standard french , winston churchill made up the ` french ' words and phraseology by taking english words and applying french grammar endings thereto in order to be rude ; he was using franglais to embarrass the french .
",
398,0,," therefore , the increased protection of the french language is necessary so that the english terminology that carries with it connotations of derision against the french be dissolved .
",
399,0,," how a people see the world is encased in the words they use to communicate with each other and the words they use to write songs , poems and stories about their people 's history and experiences .
",
400,0,," culture is inseparable from language .
",
401,0,," for example , the ` e ' on the end of a word that is silent in everyday speech becomes pronounced in french poetry and song when it figures on the end of a line , thus adding an extra syllable to that line , and so `` femme '' on the end of a line of poetry would not be pronounced `` fam '' , but `` fam-mer '' , and so an extra syllable results .
",
402,0,," this principal also helps to create more rhymes within the poetry and song .
",
403,0,," therefore , in order to keep the french culture alive , we must too protect its home language from falling to the globally dominant language of english .
",
404,0,," this is why we need an increased awareness and presence of francophone art ; higher quotas of francophone songs on the radio and the same of francophone programmes on television .
",
405,0,," these two examples demonstrate how the culture itself can be better protected when the language is better upheld .
",
406,0,," there are four levels of french language .
",
407,0,," in descending order of formality these are ; précieux , snobby , poetic , soutenu , literary , written , courant , public , administrative , familier , informal language , non-standard popular terms , argotique , very informal language , offensive if used in the wrong context or said to a stranger .
",
408,0,," `` the middle ages , ninth century -- fifteenth century ... , saw , the emergence of a new standard language , replacing latin . ''
",
409,0,," since french - if not began , at least ` grew up ' - it has functioned with these four levels of formality .
",
410,0,," franglais is not standard french , although many franglais nouns , un post-it , un walkman , would be acceptable in a formal context , and its presence , uprising and prevalence threatens the use and survival of the more formal versions of the language .
",
411,0,," it is important that the french people are not seduced by the english language but instead know their mother tongue properly and can appreciate and understand these four levels .
",
412,0,," the acceptance of franglais and anglicisms within the french language means there could well be a whole generation of french whose mother tongue is punctuated and littered with anglicisms .
",
413,0,," if english influences are allowed to prevail in the french language , then soon any linguist who writes about the french language will only be able to see it in relation to the english language that influences it ; and not as a language in its own right with those four differing levels of formality .
",
414,0,," if the french language is protected , it will not only be protected against english but against becoming degraded into a language littered with wrong usage ; good french will be upheld and defended against bad french .
",
415,0,," the french often call the use of franglais `` anglo snobberie '' and those who use it as opposed to the standard version of their mother tongue `` anglo snobs '' .
",
416,0,," this is why the organisation defense de la langue française , dlf , exists -- to invent terminology that prevents the french language from embracing yet more franglais .
",
417,0,," the movement supports the use of such words as un balladeur as opposed to un walkman .
",
418,0,," défense de la langue française also regulates the quota of francophone songs that must be played at peak listening hours on french radio stations .
",
419,0,," public opinion must be taken into account ; the french do express opposition to the anglicising of their language and so the défense de la langue française must be brought into effect , for this is the purpose it seeks to serve and it exists to solve these very problems .
",
420,0,," the french language can not realistically survive if is not upheld as a relevant and respected language in official contexts .
",
421,0,," it is a very emotive and sensitive issue for the french people .
",
422,0,," the eu was founded by a frenchman , robert schuman , france and germany were two of the five founding members , the union was created to ally france with germany and before britain joined , the french vetoed britain 's entry .
",
423,0,," now , the french feel their part is europe is becoming diluted by the use of english .
",
424,0,," by forcing them to accept the english language in the context of an eu meeting only opens the gate to making them accept the same rules as other nations ; if their own language is silenced , so too is their voice of expression and opposition .
",
425,0,," the following example demonstrates the reality of the threat to the french language being used correctly in formal contexts .
",
426,0,," in march  the then french prime minister jacques chirac shocked and appalled his people by making an address to the european union in english .
",
427,0,," french representatives present walked out in protest .
",
428,0,," the times reported in franglais and somewhat comically on the predominance of english in the union ; `` ils s ' adresseraint l’union européenne cinq fois every day en franglais '' , sic !
",
429,0,," .
",
430,0,," when translated from franglais into english , it reads they address the european union every day in franglais .
",
431,0,," the article implies that franglais has overtaken standard français as the accepted means of french communication within the european union .
",
432,0,," it is time for more language protection through active measures by the french government and défense de la langue française took the matter of defending the french language seriously , and so the measures of increased exposure to french language songs , television shows and films is necessary , as are more french -- sounding nouns for referring to modern inventions which are generally just known by their english names in france .
",
433,1,,"multiculturalism is a somewhat nebulous term, and as such can be used to mean a variety of things.
",
434,1,," this, however, will concern itself with multiculturalism as meaning the preservation of a culture distinct from that of the majority of the population.
",
435,1,," that is, choosing to exist within a community with similar values, and making deliberate decisions to identify yourself with that community in ways that visibly set yourself apart from others in your country.
",
436,1,,"in uk politics, bradford in the 1980s is often taken as an example of multiculturalism in action.
",
437,1,," a number of communities, in effect, lived side by side: the pre-existing white community, and the newly formed immigrant communities, who largely separated themselves by country and region.
",
438,1,," picked out for special attention by the press and by later events, the pakistani community was often held up as an example of one that rejected integration.
",
439,1,," often new immigrants (particularly women) had poor english skills, and thus a great dependency of other immigrants for a sense of community.
",
440,1,," parts of bradford became known as ""bradistan"" because of the prevalence of immigrants, and the various businesses set up in the area by immigrants, for immigrants (for example, shops selling products needed to produce traditionally pakistani food).
",
441,0,,"supporting multiculturalism, in the context of a debate, can mean anything from thinking that, in principle, it is better than integration, to supporting a range of policies that would enable a multicultural rather than integrated society to function (like funding for specific cultural projects, or religious schools).
",
442,0,,"cultural heritage is often very important to people , particularly to new immigrants who are already feeling the loss of their old ways of life .
",
443,0,," it is a matter of luck whether we are born in a country with lots of opportunities , or are forced to travel if we wish to seek a better life .
",
444,0,," as such , we should not penalise such unfortunate people but rather allow them to continue to practice important cultural practices .
",
445,0,," britain has introduced support for a number of non-christian faith schools that both respect and encourage the faiths and cultures of its students , many of whom are first or second-generation immigrants .1 assimilation expects immigrants to shed their cultural heritage it is expected that recent immigrants to a country will shed major parts of their cultures and values to adapt to those of the host country .
",
446,0,," but , this is unrealistic .
",
447,0,," nobody will quickly shed and adopt the new cultural elements of a nation ; a major flaw of the assimilation model .
",
448,0,," for example , america , often used as the prime example of assimilation , is not the melting pot once thought .
",
449,0,," america is a land of many cultures , where important and sustained cultural divisions between americans persist .
",
450,0,," assimilationist doctrine claims it is working towards a sense of one american-ness , but there are two problems with this notion .
",
451,0,," one , america is a land built on democratic difference -- very different political groups can and do exist .
",
452,0,," two , american assimilation has had a troubling history consisting of a dominating , white power structure aiming to restrict extending american citizen to all citizens , and denying human rights to all citizens , often because of race or skin colour .
",
453,0,," allowing people to preserve their own cultures allows other people to understand different cultural practices and ways of living life .
",
454,0,," this exposure to new experiences enriches the cultural practices of all : we are better able to make choices about the way in which we wish to live our lives , whether that is a matter of what food we eat or what religion we practice .
",
455,0,," the amish community in rural america is just one example ; ` it is not necessary to live an amish life to appreciate what they can teach us ' , the mere knowledge that one can be happy without constant access to life 's modern technologies is a humbling thought .1 neither the state nor the majority or host community has a monopoly on the knowledge of the best way to live life .
",
456,0,," as such , we each have to seek out this `` good life '' for ourselves ; it varies depending on our individual values and priorities .
",
457,0,," multiculturalism allows that there is a greater choice between ways of living , rather than everyone being `` integrated '' into a way of life that varies very little .
",
458,0,," even if some ways of life are actively harmful , the law exists to protect us against such excesses .
",
459,0,," in the united states for example , polygamy is illegal in allstates despite states like utah and colorado having large populations of mormons that believe in the practice1 .
",
460,0,," mormon culture is nevertheless still pervasive in these areas .
",
461,0,," this acts as proof that the state is able to draw a line between what is right and wrong without infringing upon the ideals of a multi-cultural society .
",
462,1,,"within in the european union, since 1991, all tobacco advertising and sponsorship on television has been banned under thetelevision without frontiers directive.
",
463,1,,"years later the ban was extended by the tobacco advertising directive to cover other forms of media such as the internet, print media, radio, and sporting events.
",
464,1,," however, this did not including all advertising - local event sponsorship and advertising in cinema and via billboards is still allowed.
",
465,1,," while this action has arguably reduced the number of people smoking, with a report from the department of health in the uk stating that in countries where a ban is in-place”...show a fall in smoking which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors”, (department of health in action on smoking and health, 2009.)
",
466,1,," smoking still continues to be a common occurrence.
",
467,1,," take, for example, france whereby even though a smoking ban is in place tobacco sales remain stubbornly high (forey, b. et al, 2009).
",
468,1,," smoking is still the main cause of preventable disease and premature death in the uk (department of health, 2010) and it is still attracting new young customers, smoke free action state that “the main purpose of tobacco marketing is to attract new smokers since established smokers tend to be brand loyal.... each year thousands of children and young people in the united kingdom start smoking, with around two-thirds starting before the age of 18.
",
469,1,," every year 340,000 children under sixteen try cigarettes for the first time.”
",
470,1,," (smoke free action, 2011) due then to only a limited success from the current bans, attention has now turned to other ways people, and particularly young people, maybe becoming attracted to smoking with the appearance of the practice in film is becoming highly scrutinized.
",
471,1,," should then films which feature smoking be banned to help further the fight against smoking or is it a step to far, is it a case of the state interfering with our lives too much and would the action threaten artistic pursuits?
",
472,0,,"what is proposed in this debate is that new films, or new home movie products, which feature smoking should be banned or alternatively any scene depicting smoking should be removed or clearly labeled before distribution.
",
473,0,,"in our highly mediated society we are bombarded with news and imagery of celebrities with many young people looking up to them as role models .
",
474,0,," many of the most famous people which the public tend to look up to are hollywood stars which regularly grace our cinema screens , there power to influence is great .
",
475,0,," a study by dr maltby shows that where previously parents , teachers and friends had the biggest influence on young people it is now more likely to be celebrities .
",
476,0,," , cassidy , s., if young people therefore see celebrities smoking on-screen , all be it while playing a character , they could be strongly influenced to start the activity themselves to emulate their role model .
",
477,0,," allowing smoking on screen by celebrities , films and their directors are condoning , glamorizing and ultimately encouraging smoking .
",
478,0,," banning smoking in films would strongly help in the fight against smoking as it would stop young adults copying their idols .
",
479,0,," when various bans across different parts of the world began to be put in place on the advertising of tobacco products the companies behind them had to find both loopholes and alternative ways of advertising their product to both current but most importantly new potential customers .
",
480,0,," one way of continuing to advertise was to invest in product placement within film which many bans did not block .
",
481,0,," the ban on advertising in the uk was introduced in, bythe instances of smoking in films had increased fourfold and the appearance of cigarette brands went up by a massive% .
",
482,0,," , bbc  a study by the american lung association also found after reviewingmovies `` ... that pg-13 movies contain more tobacco use than r-rated films intended for adults . ''
",
483,0,," and `` in a similar study the following year found that eighty percent of the popular pg-13 movies examined depicted tobacco use . ''
",
484,0,," , media awareness network  this clearly demonstrates that tobacco companies are using films to advertise their products , and particularly towards young children , this should be regulated .
",
485,0,," when smoking is used in films it is often portrayed positively without clearly demonstrating the bad effects it has .
",
486,0,," a study by gunasekera , h. et al titled `` sex and drugs in popular movies : an analysis of the topfilms '' found that smoking was portrayed in% of the films and that they `` ... tended to portray their use positively and without negative consequences . ''
",
487,0,," this normalization of smoking is hindering the effort to try and stop people taking up smoking , by regularly seeing the activity young people will consider the activity socially acceptable which gives the wrong message needed to help stop the activity and minimize health related problems from it .
",
488,0,," while films are most often fictional and produced for the purpose of entertainment people still do learn , whether rightly or wrongly , from them , it is arguably socially and morally irresponsible then for directors and films studios alike to show smoking in films without clearly demonstrating the negative side to it as it is painting an incorrect representation of what it is to be a smoker .
",
489,0,," movies are already currently regulated by film boards which provide films with an age classification as to who can see the movie based upon its content .
",
490,0,," currently film boards cover content such as violence , sex and even drug use , of which smoking is not currently included , adding the extra caveat of smoking into the analysis of film would not cause too many practical issues .
",
491,0,," the main hurdle for adding such regulation would be getting the guidelines right as to what can and can not be shown and what is appropriate for certain age groups to see or not see .
",
492,0,," creating the guidelines would have to involve both public and expert consultation but on the whole putting restrictions in place would face little if any practical problems .
",
493,1,,"according to the unesco “convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage”, the following are constituted as objects of “cultural heritage”:‘monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, elements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of features, which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science; groups of buildings: groups of separate  or connected buildings which, because of their architecture, their homogeneity or their place in the landscape, are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science;sites: works of man or the combined works of nature and man, and areas including archaeological sites which are of outstanding universal value from the historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological point of view.’
",
494,1,," [1]such sites and monuments that fit the above criteria are considered as part of our “world heritage” because of their ‘irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration’ for all peoples around the world.
",
495,1,," [2]such sites are protected under the status quo, under unesco hague convention offor the “protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict”, and the second protocol to the above convention from[3].
",
496,1,," specifically, unesco legislation exists for the protection of cultural heritage from “intentional destruction” which is defined by unesco ‘an act intended to destroy in whole or in part cultural heritage, thus compromising its integrity, in a manner which constitutes a violation of international law or an unjustifiable offence to the principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience, in the latter case in so far as such acts are not already governed by fundamental principles of international law.’
",
497,1,," [4]unesco demands that during times of internal or international conflict ‘states should take all appropriate measures to conduct their activities in such a manner as to protect cultural heritage, in conformity with customary international law and the principles and objectives of international agreements and unesco recommendations concerning the protection of such heritage during hostilities.’
",
498,1,," [5] however the same convention also states in conditions of military necessity, a waiver can exist and the cultural property can become a legitimate military target, so long as it is deemed that no other option is available to attain a similarly important strategic advantage.
",
499,1,," [6] cultural property of particular significance and value can be placed under a status of “enhanced protection” by unesco in times of conflict meaning it would no longer be susceptible to a possible waiver of “military necessity” (as under normal protection).
",
500,1,," [7] enhanced protection does not, however, place an outright ban on military actions against the protected cultural property.
",
501,1,," the cultural property in question loses its enhanced protection if it becomes used by opposing forces and becomes a military target.
",
502,1,," [8]in essence, therefore, under the status quo the protection of objects of cultural heritage often takes a back seat in times of military conflict.
",
503,1,,"this, however, also concerns the deliberate destruction of cultural property during peace time.
",
504,1,," state-sponsored destruction and desecration of items, monuments or buildings of cultural heritage has been relatively common throughout history.
",
505,1,," more recent examples include the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas in afghanistan by the taliban in 2001, mao’s attack on chinese historical and cultural heritage during the so called “cultural revolution” in the 1960s, and most recently the destruction is shrines by islamists in timbuktu in 2012.
",
506,1,,"[9]although unesco legislation does exist regarding the protection of cultural property, there is no international mechanism at the moment that condemns criminal acts and prosecutes individuals who are responsible for the destruction of cultural property [10].
",
507,1,," if the destruction and desecration of sites or items of world cultural heritage were made a crime against humanity, the prosecution of those responsible for such acts would become an added responsibility of the international criminal court (icc).
",
508,1,," the process would be one similar to how the icc prosecutes war crimes and other crimes against humanity such as genocide or mass killing and torturing.
",
509,1,," the nature of crimes against humanity, according to the icc, is such that they are crimes committed on a wide scale and systematically [11].
",
510,1,," for this reason, although the wanton destruction of cultural property will always be condemned by unesco, only the following two instances would constituted a crime against humanity:the decision of whether or not a crime against humanity has occurred would be made by unesco in conjunction with the icc and experts would be consulted in the field of the nature of the destruction and the value of the cultural property in question.
",
511,0,,"[6] ibid[7] ibid[8] ibidcultural property is important for many reasons .
",
512,0,," in this argument , its significance as part of our world cultural heritage will be assessed , while in the second argument , its local significance is examined .
",
513,0,," sites of cultural heritage often carry a large degree of aesthetic value .
",
514,0,," renowned world heritage sites like the coliseum in rome or the pyramids of giza or the forbidden city in beijing are truly stunning and constitute a masterpiece of architecture and a celebration of what the human mind and human culture are capable of .
",
515,0,," their stunning beauty alone is sufficient to warrant their protection .
",
516,0,," however cultural property is more than just aesthetically valuable -- they tell a story of human existence .
",
517,0,," everything that makes up our society , our moral and aesthetic values , our language , our traditions , our way of life etc. , derives from our ancestors .
",
518,0,," cultural property -- be it in the form of archaeological sites , monuments or texts and art , provide our only means of connecting with our past .
",
519,0,," this is invaluable because of the enormous potential for understanding different cultures around the world and how they interact and often conjoin with each other .
",
520,0,," it offers opportunities for us to learn from the past and forge a better future .
",
521,0,," recent atrocities such as the looting of museums in bagdad and the damage caused to parts of ancient babylon during the recent iraq war are hugely harmful to the international community .
",
522,0,," the loss of part of our world heritage is even greater when one realises that the harms do not only affect our present day society , but all of future humanity .
",
523,0,," the far-reaching and global nature of this harm is sufficient for it to be considered a crime against humanity .
",
524,0,," indeed , ` international practice in this ﬁeld indicates deliberate extensive destruction of cultural heritage may be included among international crimes ' .
",
525,0,,"  the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , icty , for example , ` places the destruction of buildings dedicated to religion , or of historical and artistic monuments among war crimes , that are part of the broader concept of crimina juris gentium , or crimes against the peace and the security of mankind ' .
",
526,0,,"  it is therefore evident that despite the lack of a global mechanism , such as the icc , that currently condemns the destruction of cultural property as crimes against humanity , international precedent with the icty suggests it would be perfectly reasonable to do so .
",
527,0,,"  ibid items and sites of cultural heritage are often destroyed for discriminatory and oppressive reasons .
",
528,0,," the maoist onslaught on all `` old '' aspects of chinese culture is a prime example while the destruction of the buddhas of bamiyan in afghanistan by the taliban inis another recent example .
",
529,0,," these were violent , ideologically driven attacks on the part of the state against segments of that states own society .
",
530,0,," the buddhas of bamiyan were destroyed by the taliban simply because they were not part of the islamic society they were trying to create .
",
531,0,," such explicitly discriminatory attacks are particularly harmful to cultures that are the victims of the attacks for two reasons .
",
532,0,," firstly because the cultural property in question has increased cultural , religious or historical value for them , and secondly because such discriminatory acts attack the very identity of people part of that cultural group .
",
533,0,," the international community has a duty to protect cultural groups , especially minority groups , from discrimination .
",
534,0,," the international community in the form of the united nations general assembly has recognised attacks on religious sites as being discrimination based upon belief .
",
535,0,,"  moreover , the icty treated discriminatory attacks against cultural property during the break-up of yugoslavia , as a crime against humanity .
",
536,0,," once again , therefore , international precedent facilitates the prosecution of those responsible of those responsible for the desecration or destruction of cultural property .
",
537,0,," were the desecration and destruction of items and sites of cultural heritage to be an internationally recognised crime against humanity , people would be more reluctant in causing either intended or collateral damage , in a conflict , to them .
",
538,0,," under the status quo , unesco conventions alone are insufficient to protect cultural property .
",
539,0,," firstly , it provides insufficient protection , since even high-value cultural property under `` enhanced protection '' can be legally targeted in a conflict , if it is being used by opposition forces .
",
540,0,," moreover , the current conventions lack sufficient deterrents to back-up its protective measures .
",
541,0,," for example , us forces set up military bases in and around ancient babylon during the iraq war and even used parts of the ancient site to make sandbags .
",
542,0,," this constitutes a violation of the unesco conventions , because us forces actively caused damage to the cultural property and also , in locating their forces there , made the site of ancient babylon a legitimate military target for opposing forces .
",
543,0,,"  us forces were not concerned with potentially damaging cultural property or going against unesco conventions , simply because there were insufficient penalties in place to deter them from doing so .
",
544,0,," by treating the destruction of cultural property as a crime against humanity , rather than simply a violation of unesco conventions , the protection of cultural heritage is seen as an increased moral imperative .
",
545,0,," making such crimes punishable by the icc alongside crimes like genocide would add a deterrent factor and make it less likely people would deliberately destroy cultural property .
",
546,1,,"the almost continuous growth of the industry is not without its side-effects.
",
547,1,," following growing evidence of ecological damage at a number of the world’s most popular tourist sites, alongside fears about the impact of tourism upon regions’ populations, politics and natural resources, international organisations such as unesco have begun to look seriously at providing developing states with incentives to limit the number of tourists that they accept into their territory.
",
548,0,," tourism vastly increases income within a particular state or region , not only through direct spending by tourists , but also as a result of increases in tax revenue and the growth of local markets for food , services and luxury goods .
",
549,0,," tourism provides a boost to the amount of capital available in an area that purely local spending can not achieve , even if assisted by government subsidies or tax breaks for domestic businesses .
",
550,0,," in many developing states , tourism acts as an alternative to cash crops , improving terms of trade , both within the country 's internal market and with its neighbours .
",
551,0,," tourism helps to diversify economies , reducing reliance on finite or export-led economic activities such as mining and agricultural production .
",
552,0,," both farming and mineral extraction are largely dependent on export markets and the customs charges and cross-border trade agreements that facilitate them .
",
553,0,," tourism is set apart from this type of economic activity .
",
554,0,," the processes of production and exchange that define tourism take place within the host state itself , while the capital that drives these activities originates outside its borders .
",
555,0,," foreign corporate investment - in the form of casinos , hotels and travel ports - is supplemented by the commerce that it attracts .
",
556,0,," developing states can dictate the extent to which tourists ' spending is taxed , without having to make the concessions and trade-offs inherent in trading with other national entities .
",
557,0,," trading with tourists also gives states a supply-side advantage when it comes to selling luxury goods .
",
558,0,," as large business entities , importers are better able to use bulk purchasing and collective bargaining to acquire discounts on food stuffs , clothing and jewellery from nations with underdeveloped export economies .
",
559,0,," by contrast , trade with tourists allows a larger number of indigenous retailers to demand broadly higher prices -- tourists do not buy in bulk , nor do they bargain collectively .
",
560,0,," revenues from tourism can be used to enhance a developing state 's infrastructure , providing quantities of capital that may normally be out of reach to central government or to aid providers .
",
561,0,," via taxes levied on hotels , tourists and goods providers , funding can be generated for the construction of roads , hospitals , power stations and schools .
",
562,0,," reinvestment of this type can be used to spur further diversification within a state 's economy .
",
563,0,," it can make doing business within the state a more attractive proposition for foreign investors .
",
564,0,," forming close ties with resource extraction firms and manufacturers is a popular development strategy for many poorer states , but it offers significant disadvantages in comparison to tourism .
",
565,0,," not only does resource extraction , by its very nature , require states to consent to its territory sustaining pervasive and long-term environmental damage , it also tends to incentivise infrastructure projects that are only of use to the resource extraction industry .
",
566,0,," roads can ferry medical supplies to communities as easily as they ferry tourists .
",
567,0,," an oil pipeline will only ever be useful for transporting oil .
",
568,0,," tourists ' cash can be employed in efforts to reduce the negative externalities generated by leisure travel .
",
569,0,," ecological damage resulting from increased volumes of air and sea traffic and the construction of hospitality facilities is frequently cited as a reason to limit the growth of the tourism industry in developing nations .
",
570,0,," dependence on the industry for jobs and investment is seen as reducing the amount of control that developing states can exercise over potentially exploitative firms -- if a firm pulls out in response to assertive government action - taking jobs and money with it - that government will become unpopular .
",
571,0,," however , the more money that a state makes from tourism , the more money it has to invest in other sectors of its economy .
",
572,0,," by incentivising the development of alternative forms of business and employment , a state can feasibly release itself from dependence on the tourist trade .
",
573,0,," as profits from tourism grow , a state will become freer to dictate the terms on which tour operators , hotel owners and tourists themselves do business -- tourists ' money will have been used to create other sources of growth , investment and employment within that economy .
",
574,0,," managed properly , tourism and the conservation of wildlife habitats and areas of archaeological significance need not be mutually exclusive activities .
",
575,0,," indeed , recent trends in ecotourism have demonstrated that tourists themselves can be co-opted to monitor and survey the environments that they are visiting .
",
576,0,," the fees paid by tourists to gain access to heritage locations such as pompeii , the valley of kings and machu pichu can be funnelled into restoration and preservation schemes on those sites .
",
577,1,,"the use of the n-word is a highly contentious issue in american society.
",
578,1,," its roots come from the word ""negro"", spanish for ‘black’ which was commonly used to refer to people with dark skin.
",
579,1,," the use of the n-word was then used throughout the majority of us history by white americans as a racial slur, meant to degrade and harm anyone of african or caribbean descent and reinforce the wideheld beleifs that those of white european descent were naturally superior.
",
580,1,,"  today, it is highly taboo for a caucasians to use the n-word, even in reference to its offensive usage.
",
581,1,," yet, it also has become widely used within the black community in a diversity of ways, both endearing and insulting.
",
582,1,," many within the black community have subsequently called for quitting and even banning its use.
",
583,1,," in march of 2007, for example, the n-word was banned by the new york city council.
",
584,1,," while the ban carries no legal punishment, it was a symbolic move that represents a tide of opposition to the use of the n-word in america.
",
585,1,," the debate remains very active within the black community, within localities and municipalities, in with the larger america political culture.
",
586,1,,"in debating terms this is a variant of the more general debates over the use of language, free speech and obscenity which carries a very specific contextual background.
",
587,0,," only intent , not the word `` nigger '' , can be racist .
",
588,0,," the word `` nigger '' is not racist .
",
589,0,," a word can never be racist , the only way a word is racist if it is used with racist intent and explained that way .
",
590,0,," there are other words besides `` nigger '' that is just as offensive because of the connotation , like `` eggplant '' .
",
591,0,," the word by itself has no meaning ; the history of the word and the situations in which the word is used brings the word to life .
",
592,0,," the term is both endearing and disrespectful depending on the situation in which it used .
",
593,0,," for example i can say `` you 're my nigga ! ''
",
594,0,," and it 's reviewed as positive or i can say `` you 're a nigga , '' and it can be seen as negative .
",
595,0,," the common debate about this word does n't exist so much with how to use it , but more so who uses it .
",
596,0,," blacks use `` nigger '' to defy the history of the word and evoke empowerment randall kennedy .
",
597,0,," `` nigger '' .
",
598,0,," 2002 .
",
599,0,," pp- `` self-hatred ... is an implausible explanation for why many assertive , politically progressive african americans continue to say ` nigger ' openly and frequently in conversations with one another .
",
600,0,," these are americans who , in their own minds at least , use nigger not in subjection to racial subordination , but in defiance of it ... many black also do with nigger what other members of marginalized groups have done with slurs aimed at shaming them .
",
601,0,," they have thrown the slur right back in their oppressor ' faces . ''
",
602,0,," `` nigger '' is a term of endearment between blacks .
",
603,0,," black people frequently use the word `` nigger '' to identify with and bond with each other .
",
604,0,," for some , this relates to a common identification between blacks with the oppression represented by the word `` nigger '' this kind of usage is in a similar way to how other minority groups have used such oppressive words , e.g. british pakistani youths using the term ` paki power ' and jewish supporters of tottenham hotspur football club referring to themselves as ` the yid army ' , such uses should be allowed as they express freedoms such words were designed to squash .
",
605,0,," blacks should be allowed to refer to each other however they want seeing as the insult originated out of an aim to dehumanize them .
",
606,0,," language is only effective in the way it is understood .
",
607,0,," meaning of words shifts over time ; `` nigger '' has softened .
",
608,0,," there was a time when the word `` black '' was offensive when describing african-americans .
",
609,0,," the word `` black '' was used to define everything in a negative way , african americans preferred to be called `` negro '' or `` colored '' in the late 1800s and most of the 1900s .
",
610,0,," it was n't until figures like stokely carmichael , adam clayton powell , malcolm x , huey p. newton , james brown , syl johnson , tommie smith and john carlos began to endorse `` black power '' and `` black is beautiful '' did african americans associate themselves with black as a signal of positivity .
",
611,0,," prior to the black panther era , black was just as negative as nigger .
",
612,0,," the fact that the word has been switched from negative to positive , shows that language can be manipulated and changes with the time .
",
613,0,," more common usage of the word can aid this process , making it more legitimate as well as changing its meaning from a derogative term applying to one particular race to a humorous term to describe someone in the same in which ` retard ' has had meaning change from a word for someone with learning difficulties to a humorous term for someone who acts in a stupid way through common usage in this context in popular culture .
",
614,0,," education is better than banning `` nigger '' at fighting racism . ''
",
615,0,," ` nigger ' please ! ''
",
616,0,," .
",
617,0,," this week in race .
",
618,0,," july 14th ,- `` while censorship is never an answer to countering offensive speech , and while proposals to ban the word are , for the most part , symbolic in nature and would not be legally binding , education is clearly the best tool for ensuring that people have an informed view about the word -- one that would temper and moderate their use or abuse of the term . ''
",
619,0,," a dangerous double standard has emerged over the use of the word `` nigger '' .
",
620,0,," it is acceptable depending on who uses it .
",
621,0,," a black person can say it and it can be endearing , but if an outside race uses it , it is automatically racist .
",
622,0,," difficulties can arise from its use being misinterpreted purely on the race of the person using it .
",
623,0,," surely it is best for all if such an anomaly is removed by making it acceptable for all people to use the word within the changing context highlighted earlier in the debate .
",
624,0,," if this happens , then accusations of ` preferential treatment ' towards african-americans with regard to the use of words can no longer be used as a pretext for barely disguised prejudice which is still prevalent in society .
",
625,0,," banning the use of `` nigger '' alienates non-black minorities .
",
626,0,," `` banning use of n-word wo n't silence racism ... is the word `` nigger '' somehow more offensive than the words `` faggot , '' `` dyke , '' `` chink , '' `` spic , '' `` gook '' or `` kike '' ?
",
627,0,," by specifically banning a racial slur against one group , the , new york , city council fails to address the problems faced by various other groups .
",
628,0,," why should it be acceptable to use slurs against gays , lesbians , chicanos , hispanics , asians and jews , but not blacks ?
",
629,0,," in a city comprised of many different racial groups , who all face problems with racism and stereotypes , it is highly inappropriate for the city council to specifically condemn the use of racist terms against only one . ''
",
630,0,," allowing the use of words can serve to make the person who uses the abuser to think more about the effect that said words would have if there is a similar insult that affects their particular demographic .
",
631,0,," if societies such as the united states are to be truly post-racial , then surely it needs to move beyond the's debate around the word and focus on other areas of race relations that are directly affected by policy such as blacks having lower educational achievement , higher unemployment rates and higher rates of incarceration in federal prisons .
",
632,0,," by focussing energies on these issues and what can be done to correct them , the terms of debate can shift away from one framed in terms of the past to one based in the here and now , resulting in the necessary real change instead of tokenistic gestures such as the one made in new york in.
",
633,1,,"“1, seeking ways and means of facilitating bilateral negotiations for the restitution or return of cultural property to its countries of origin…2, promoting multilateral and bilateral cooperation with a view to the restitution and return of cultural property to its countries of origin;3.
",
634,1,," encouraging the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed;4.
",
635,1,," fostering a public information campaign on  the real nature, scale and scope of the problem of the restitution or return of cultural property to its countries of origin”as well as this it guides implementation of unesco programmes on such restitution, encourages establishment of museums and provides training for the care of cultural properties and promotes exchanges.
",
636,1,,"the debate about the return of cultural property to countries of origin is most often argued in terms of the elgin (or parthenon) marbles, masterpieces of classical greek sculpture removed from the parthenon in athens inby lord elgin, and sold to the british museum in london in 1816.
",
637,1,," greece has consistently demanded the return of these national treasures since independence in 1830, which britain has consistently refused.
",
638,1,," the marbles are part of a wider debate about the ownership and display of cultural treasures, often acquired from the developing world by imperial powers in the 18th and 19th centuries, and now displayed in western museums.
",
639,1,," the british museum’s charter implies that the institution cannot legally return items from its collection: ""the trustees of the british museum hold its collections in perpetuity by virtue of the power vested in them by the british museum act (1963)"".
",
640,1,," yet the debate rages: should cultural property such as the parthenon marbles be returned to its country of origin?
",
641,0,," cultural treasures should be displayed in the context in which they originated ; only then can they be truly valued and understood .
",
642,0,," in the case of the parthenon marbles this is an architectural context which only proximity to the parthenon itself can provide .
",
643,0,," in the british museum they appear as mere disconnected fragments , stripped of any emotional meaning .
",
644,0,," it may also be useful for academics to have a cultural property in its original context in order to be able to understand it , for example a carved door may be a beautiful artefact but it can not be truly understood unless we know what the door was used for , where it leads too something for which it is necessary to see the context .
",
645,0,," cultural and historical tourism is an important source of income for many countries , and is especially important for developing countries .
",
646,0,," if their artefacts have been appropriated by foreign museums in wealthy nations then they are being deprived of the economic opportunity to build a successful tourist trade .
",
647,0,," both the treasures themselves are being devalued as is the experience of seeing the treasures .
",
648,0,," display of cultural treasures in western museums may be seen as a last hangover from the imperial belief that `` civilised '' states such as britain were the true cultural successors to ancient greece and rome , and that the ` barbarian ' inhabitants of those ancient regions were unable to appreciate or look after their great artistic heritage .
",
649,0,," whether that was true in the 19th century is open to doubt ; it certainly is not valid today and the display of imperial trophies in institutions such as the british museum or the louvre is a reminder to many developing nations of their past oppression .
",
650,0,," for instance , the british museum is refusing to returnof the benin bronzes to nigeria despite repeated requests by the nigerian government .
",
651,0,," the rosetta stone has been the subject of demands by the egyptian government but remains in london .
",
652,0,," these artefacts become almost souvenirs of imperialism , a way of retaining cultural ownership long after the political power of britain has faded .
",
653,0,," returning them would be a gesture of goodwill and cooperation .
",
654,0,," artefacts were often acquired illegally .
",
655,0,," elgin , for instance , appropriated the parthenon marbles from the ottoman authorities who had invaded greece and were arguably not the rightful owners of the site ; he took advantage of political turmoil to pillage these ancient statues .
",
656,0,," doubt has even been cast on the legality of thedocument which purportedly gave elgin permission to remove the marbles .
",
657,0,," the axum obelisk was seized from ethiopia by mussolini as a trophy of war ; fortunately the injustice of this action has since been recognised and the obelisk was restored to its rightful place in.
",
658,0,," it may have been true that countries such as greece were not capable of looking after their heritage in the past , but that has now changed .
",
659,0,," since5 greece has been carefully restoring the acropolis and athens now has a secure environment to maintain the marbles .
",
660,0,," the state-of-the-art new acropolis museum , which cost $ 200m , has now been completed to house the surviving marbles , and even contains a replica of the temple , thus the marbles would appear as being exactly the same as on the real temple .
",
661,0,," pollution control measures , such as installing pollution monitoring stations throughout metropolitan athens and ensuring that motor vehicles must comply with emission standards , have reduced sulphur-dioxide levels in the city to a fifth of their previous levels .
",
662,0,," at the same time the curatorship of institutions such as the british museum is being called into question , as it becomes apparent that controversial cleaning and restoration practices may have harmed the sculptures they claim to protect .
",
663,0,," in the 1930s the british museum 's attempt to clean them using chisels caused irreparable damage .
",
664,0,," they have also been irresponsible when it comes to protecting the fate of many of its artefacts : `` the british museum has sold off more thancontroversial benin bronzes for as little as #each since, it has emerged '' ; `` the museum now regrets the sales '' .
",
665,1,,"the first modern beauty pageants took place in the united states in the second half of the 19th century with the first miss united states bathing beauty contest being held at rehoboth beach, delaware in 1880.
",
666,1,," beauty contests are popular in many parts of the world.
",
667,1,," the biggest, the miss world competition, has been running annually since 1951, and although it is less popular in the uk now than it was in 1968, when it attracted 27.5 million tv viewers, it attracts an enormous worldwide audience – up tobillion viewers incountries.
",
668,1,," there are beauty contests for various categories of age, sex and sexuality; this topic focuses on adult women’s beauty contests as overwhelmingly the most popular and high-profile version.
",
669,1,,"note that there are difficult technical issues about running this debate: it probably works best as a values debate on whether beauty contests are a good thing or not, but this kind of comparison motion is frowned upon in some policy-based debating circles.
",
670,1,," proposing a ban on beauty contests might be met with various entirely valid opposition lines on enforceability and warped priorities (what about porn?)
",
671,1,,", which would tend to undermine the point of the debate.
",
672,0,," beauty contests promote an ideal of female beauty to which only a minority of women can realistically aspire , but which adds to the pressure on all women to conform to it .
",
673,0,," this can be harmful to women by encouraging dieting , eating disorders and cosmetic surgery , or simply by making them feel inadequate and ugly by comparison to this ` ideal ' that is promoted .
",
674,0,," moreover , these contests force the models and contestants to look even slimmer and perfect all the time , thus encouraging anorexia and bulimia .
",
675,0,," naomi wolf argues that `` in terms of how we feel about ourselves physically , we may actually be worse off than our un-liberated grandmothers . ''
",
676,0,," why ?
",
677,0,," because of how `` cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us . ''
",
678,0,," this pressure has therefore forced a backwards step that reduces freedom of women when in almost every other area of life there have been great advances .
",
679,0,," women in beauty contests are judged on their physical appearance rather than on any other qualities they may possess , the existence of a ` talent ' element in many such contests is all very well , but ugly women simply are n't going to win .
",
680,0,," judging women , but not men , primarily on their looks contributes to the subjugation of women because other qualities , such as intelligence , are not seen as part of ideal femininity and therefore not as things to which women should aspire .
",
681,0,," ideal masculinity , while in itself potentially damaging to men , tends to be construed in much wider and less restrictive terms - it is notable that male beauty contests , judging men on their physical appearance , are much less popular than female ones .
",
682,0,," the image of female beauty promoted by beauty contests is culturally specific and western - it does n't matter how many asian women win miss world , they can still only do so if they take part in the swimsuit competition , which may well not be considered appropriate dress in their culture .
",
683,0,," this clash of cultures has led to numerous protests , demonstrations and even violence when beauty contests are going on .
",
684,0,," there were demonstrations against miss world by feminists and hindu nationalists when it was held in bangalore in.
",
685,0,," riots in kaduna in northern nigeria over miss worldleft more thandead and led to the contest being moved to london .
",
686,1,,"locally produced food is food that has been farmed near to the point of sale.
",
687,1,," however how local still counts as local?
",
688,1,,"  whole foods in the usa considers local producers to be withinmiles of the store or as much ashours travel away while many people would consider that it should be much more local, even within the usa 50% believe local should mean within 100miles.
",
689,1,,"over the past decade the politics of food has assumed increasing importance in western countries.
",
690,1,," organic farming has become a mainstream movement worth billions of dollars a year and fair-trade goods are now sold in most supermarkets.
",
691,1,," the slow food movement, which celebrates the authenticity of regional cuisine, seasonal changes in the availability of foodstuffs, and the labor of small-scale producers, has spread from its origins in italy to become influential in the usa, britain and beyond.
",
692,1,,"part of this upsurge of interest in where food comes from has been a recent emphasis on shopping locally, buying foods from crops grown and livestock raised by nearby farmers.
",
693,1,," in the uk, usa and elsewhere, farmers markets where local producers sell directly to consumers have taken off, providing producers with an alternative to selling the fruits of their labors to hard-bargaining supermarkets.
",
694,1,," locally-produced foods are also sold directly from farm shops, and through delivery schemes such as weekly vegetable boxes.
",
695,1,,"increasingly, major food purchasers such as councils and schools are making commitments to buy locally-grown produce for use in the meals they provide.
",
696,1,," and major supermarket chains such as the uk’s tesco are increasingly stocking ranges of locally-produced foods, selling them at a profitable price premium.
",
697,1,,"supporters of shopping for locally produced food argue that it has a great many advantages, from economic support for the area’s farmers and greater community cohesion, to environmental and health benefits.
",
698,1,," but while nobody takes the extremist position that you should never buy locally-produced foods, critics have begun to question whether many of the benefits claimed for shopping local actually exist, and to point out that there may be actual disadvantages of too much emphasis on local purchasing.
",
699,1,,"this however is not all about individual consumers deciding to buy in farmers markets.
",
700,1,," it is much easier and more effective if it was the shops themselves, including supermarkets, which have to source as much food as possible locally.
",
701,1,," any regulation to force local sourcing of products would be difficult as local produce is not available at all times and different localities will produce different products.
",
702,1,," however there could be inducements such as tax breaks for the amount of locally sourced food.
",
703,1,," simply locally sourcing the food is not enough, stores should have to ensure that the produce does not have to travel unnecessarily long distances.
",
704,0,,"  shopping for local produce is also part of a wider movement to rediscover and celebrate local food cultures .
",
705,0,," the slow food movement emphasises the cultural importance of local cuisines based upon the range of foods that are available within a particular region .
",
706,0,," by treating the whole world as our larder we have gained an enormous choice of foods , but at the cost of our own culinary heritage and folk traditions .
",
707,0,," this can cause problems as for example with local varieties of rice in africa being lost due to competition from cheaper rice producers like thailand .
",
708,0,," each individual cuisine deserves to be preserved and encouraged .
",
709,0,," we have also lost a sense of seasonality , expecting asparagus and strawberries all year round .
",
710,0,," local food restores this connection with the rhythm of the seasons , and connects us to the land around us and to our ancestors who helped to shape it .
",
711,0,," by creating a market for a wide variety of agricultural produce , shopping locally will encourage local farmers to grow and rear a wide variety of crops and animals .
",
712,0,," intensive modern farming often consists of huge agribusinesses growing monocultures of wheat , corn , rape or soya over vast areas , with little room left for nature .
",
713,0,," in britain this has led to a decline in farmland birds with numbers at ayear low , even livestock farming can impose one type of farming practice upon the environment and drive out plants and animals which can not cope with those methods .
",
714,0,," more varied farming practices are valuable for promoting biodiversity , encouraging a whole range of birds , animals and plants to establish themselves in field margins and adjacent wild areas .
",
715,0,," local variety is also good farming practice , as it means that any disease or pest infestation will not be able to spread quickly to devastate a whole region .
",
716,0,," shopping locally supports local farmers and the local economy -- and if it is the retailer who is buying locally then whether the retailer itself is not local will not matter .
",
717,0,," typically farmers are forced to sell to middlemen or big business , such as huge supermarket corporations .
",
718,0,," this means growers see only a small fraction of the price the public eventually pays in the store , as little ascents of every dollar in the usa .
",
719,0,," this drives down farm incomes and is forcing many farmers off the land as they can no longer make a living .
",
720,0,," by selling directly to the public at farmers ' markets and farm shops instead , producers can ensure that they get a fair price for their crops and livestock .
",
721,0,," the income this provides is particularly crucial for small producers , and for farmers committed to more sustainable , less intensive methods , such as organic production .
",
722,0,," it does not only help the farmers , but also the rest of the economy .
",
723,0,," while many experts confess that it is hard to measure the direct effects of buying local products , dan houston from an economic development consultancy projected inwith the example of austin book stores that buying local saves jobs .
",
724,0,," he explained that on every dollar to the austin economy ,cents returns , while with buying at the national store borders , the return to the community is onlycents .
",
725,0,," also the researcher emphasized that in the michigan community grand rapids , a% shift of spending towards local businesses incould createjobs with a payroll ofmillion dollars .
",
726,0,," consumers who want to support their local producers and sustainable farming over big agribusiness and retailers should therefore aim to shop locally wherever possible .
",
727,0,," buying locally-produced food means that it will be much fresher and healthier .
",
728,0,," typical supermarket fruit and vegetables are often picked 4-7 days before they make it on to the shelves , and so may be nearly two weeks old before they are actually eaten , by which time much of their goodness will have long departed .
",
729,0,," to cope with these long delays , many fruits are picked in an unripe state , so that they do not start to rot on the supermarket shelves -- meaning their full flavour has never developed out in the sun on the tree or plant .
",
730,0,," by buying locally consumers can ensure that they get the tastiest , healthiest food as it is often picked the afternoon before going to market or if going to stores can get there in much less time .
",

",
732,1,,"museums are expensive to run, with the costs of acquisitions, conservation, maintenance, staff salaries and special exhibitions all weighing heavily upon their budgets.
",
733,1,," in many cases much of their funding comes from the government, whether at national or local level, with the remainder made up through endowments, income from museum shops and other commercial ventures, private donations and sponsorship, and, very often, through entry fees.
",
734,1,," in the 1990s almost all of britain's museums charged for admission but a few of the leading institutions (e.g. the british museum, the natural history museum, the national gallery) became free as a result of labour government policy.
",
735,1,," nevertheless, most museums worldwide, including the likes of the louvre and the guggenheim, charge admission fees.
",
736,1,," proponents of free museum entrance fees argue that free museums encourage attendance and therefore increase education and awareness of state heritage.
",
737,0,," opponents respond that there is little evidence that free prices encourage new attendees rather than repeat visitors and that state funding should be used elsewhere.
",
738,0,,"museums preserve and display our artistic , social , scientific and political heritage .
",
739,0,," everyone should have access to such important cultural resources as part of active citizenship , and because of the educational opportunities they offer to people of every age .
",
740,0,," glenn lowry , director of the museum of modern art , claims ` it 's almost a moral duty that museums should be free ' , smith  .
",
741,0,," if museums are not funded sufficiently by the government , they will be forced to charge for entry , and this will inevitably deter many potential visitors , especially the poor and those whose educational and cultural opportunities have already been limited .
",
742,0,," visitors to the victoria and albert museum in london declined by% after it started charging for admission .
",
743,0,," free access is essential to provide freedom of cultural and educational opportunity , garrett  .
",
744,0,," museums are a crucial source of inspiration and education for our increasingly important creative industries , e.g. art , design , fashion , and architecture .
",
745,0,," as the secretary of the national union of teachers described , ` free access means that every child can benefit from the treasure chest ... regardless of the depth of the parental pocket ' , russell & taylor  .
",
746,0,," free access is an investment in the future of both the education and creative sectors of the economy and therefore has long-term benefits in securing prosperity for the whole of society .
",
747,0,," similarly , tourism is an important sector of our economy and many visitors will be deterred from visiting our country if they think it will be very expensive to visit its great museums and galleries .
",
748,0,," tourists do contribute hugely to government revenues through the indirect taxes they pay and the jobs they generate , tourism is a # 115bn industry , bbc news  so free museum access to support the tourism industry is a sensible investment .
",
749,0,," in the uk , labour government policy resulted in some of the leading national museums ending admissions charges .
",
750,0,," their policy was in response to evidence from the 1980s that suggested museums that started charging visitors ` saw their numbers plummet on average by a third -- and never fully recover ' , barrie  .
",
751,0,," labour 's policy shift had the effect of increasing visitor numbers greatly , proving that free entry is beneficial in increasing public exposure to culture .
",
752,0,," this can be shown by the uk having the highest number of visitors to art museums of any country based upon the art newspaper 's figures for topvisited galleries in.
",
753,0,," , the art newspaper  other countries should follow this example in order to draw more people into their own national museums .
",
754,0,," the contributions of government funding have been shown to be capable of sustaining the costs of a museum , preventing those costs being passed on to the public in the form of admissions charges .
",
755,0,," the examples of the british labour government funding national museums has been noted above .
",
756,0,," the national museum of the american indian in washington was set up partially with government funding and partially with private funds , ensuring it has remained free since its opening in, democracy now  .
",
757,0,," in, china also announced that fromall of its national museums would become publicly-funded and cease charging admissions fees , zhu & guo  .
",
758,1,,"professional cheerleaders can be found across a range of sports including american football, basketball, rugby league and wrestling.
",
759,1,," they are particularly popular in the usa but can also be found in other countries.
",
760,1,," for example, many teams in the australian national rugby league are accompanied at matches by their own cheerleading squads.
",
761,1,," these squads are mainly made up of women, and are paid considerably less than the men who make up the teams that they support.
",
762,1,,"this is not about banning cheerleading as an extra-curricular activity in schools or at college, nor is it about banning amateur cheerleading competitions (those organised for cheerleading teams who are not paid).
",
763,1,," it should focus on the role of professional cheerleaders who exist specifically to support men’s sport teams, rather than to represent a school or college more generally.
",
764,0,," professional cheerleaders cause men to think of women as objects .
",
765,0,," they exist on the sidelines , wearing short skirts and looking pretty , whilst the male sports players are the heroes .
",
766,0,," this affects the way that men view women more generally .
",
767,0,," it makes them think that women are less important than men .
",
768,0,," even where professional cheerleading squads contain men , this view of women is reinforced : male cheerleaders lift women and throw them around as if they are objects and only there for decoration .
",
769,0,," professional cheerleaders affect how people view women in general , and therefore there is harm to society .
",
770,0,," although freedom of choice is often important , it is inhibited at the point that one person starts to harm others or society .
",
771,0,," as this happens in this case , cheerleading should be banned .
",
772,0,," professional cheerleaders are bad role models for women , and especially for teenagers who take part in cheerleading .
",
773,0,," they tend to wear shorter skirts and show more of their skin than college and high school cheerleaders .
",
774,0,," in addition , their routines tend to be more obviously sexual , and less focused on gymnastic stunts .
",
775,0,," when young girls at high school level are encouraged to do so , it is problematic because the sexualisation of cheer routines reinforces the idea that ` macho ' men , playing sports , a traditionally male field , are sexually rewarded or gratified for their ` macho ' performance .
",
776,0,," it reinforces the glamour of being a ` macho ' man and these men can begin to feel entitled to sexual gratification .
",
777,0,," this can lead to anger when they are turned down , which can escalate to sexual violence against women , for example , the case of the high school cheerleader who was sexually assaulted by a member of her basketball team that she cheered for .
",
778,0,," a large number of women and teenage girls suffer from eating disorders .
",
779,0,," part of the desire to be thin comes from the constant parade of ` perfect ' women .
",
780,0,," professional cheerleaders often have much of their body on show , and as men cheer them and comment on their looks , the message to women is reinforced : it is important to fit a specific version of beauty .
",
781,0,," women are very talented at sport , as demonstrated by venus and serena williams in tennis , paula radcliff in athletics or nastia liukin in gymnastics .
",
782,0,," however , when people see cheerleaders they are more likely to view women 's role in sport as one confined to looking pretty on the sidelines .
",
783,0,," women 's sport already receives a lot less coverage than men 's sport , and it is important to promote the success that women achieve .
",
784,0,," professional cheerleaders detract from this .
",
785,0,," this is further true considering that many of the women participating in professional cheerleading would no doubt be very talented at other athletic pursuits .
",
786,0,," the perception of women as on the side-lines is so ingrained that most women 's sport teams do not have a cheer squad and in several high schools in the us , cheerleaders have been uncomfortable when asked to cheer for girls sports teams .
",
787,0,," professional cheerleaders discourage lots of women , religious people and families from attending professional sports games .
",
788,0,," many people do not want to watch women dancing on the pitch wearing skimpy clothes , so do not attend .
",
789,0,," similarly , they do not bring their children because they think that it is inappropriate .
",
790,0,," professional sports games are a great way to bring people together to form a community .
",
791,0,," it also encourages children to take part in sport themselves , improving their health .
",
792,0,," professional cheerleaders are harmful because they discourage such attendance .
",
793,0,," cheerleading is a highly strenuous sport .
",
794,0,," it combines gymnastics with dance .
",
795,0,," it is also high impact , very energetic and requires sophisticated synchronized moves .
",
796,0,," not only do college teams and high school teams cheer their sports teams , but they also perform at competitions .
",
797,0,," professional squads , however , exist for the sole purpose of cheering their professional sports team .
",
798,0,," because the seeming ` professionals ' are only supporting their team and are only there to entertain , it diminishes the overall status of cheerleading as a sport .
",
799,0,," this is unfair since it is a highly demanding activity that should be considered a sport , and yet the girls and boys who participate in college and high school are not considered real athletes .
",
800,1,,"nationalism is an ideology that involves the strong identification of a group of individuals with a political entity defined in national terms (i.e. a nation).
",
801,1,," nationalism can be defined by common origin or ethnicity or sometimes just of cultural ties based on where they live.
",
802,1,," nationalism is a relatively new development in human history, prior to the mid-late 18th centuries people would generally define their loyalty in terms of a particular region or locality or as common subjects of a particular monarch.
",
803,1,,"  italy and germany for example existed for much of the middle ages as collections of duchies and city states with varying degrees of connection between them.
",
804,1,," nationalism cannot be said to coerce at any particular point (though napoleon relied greatly on stirring nationalist sentiment to support the puppet monarchies he installed throughout europe at the start of the 19th century), but it is closely linked to the development of the modern state and popular sovereignty.
",
805,1,," nationalism goes beyond the mere grouping of people with a shared culture – nationalist tendencies can and have been used to justify irredentist policies of annexing territories that largely contain foreign ethnicities based on claims of prior historical possession.
",
806,1,," (e.g. alsace-lorraine has passed from germany to france and back again multiple times in history).
",
807,1,,"  nationalism has also been partially responsible for a significant increase in the scale of warfare – wars went from being fought with the private armies of monarchs to with the resources of an entire people.
",
808,1,,"while nationalism has increased the scope of the group that people consider themselves a part of, it is still an ideology that relies on forming distinctions between ‘us’ and ‘others’.
",
809,1,,"  nationalism’s notoriety has risen in the last decade, as ethnic strife in the balkans, parts of africa and elsewhere has been described in terms of rival nationalities.
",
810,1,," the current academic view is that national identities are purely a social construction, it is to use benedict anderson’s phrase an ‘imagined community’ as the members of the community will never know most of the others in the community, reinforced through social norms and institutions.
",
811,1,," people build states based upon national identity and take up arms against those who would deny them it.
",
812,1,," passing judgement on nationalism requires that one examine what people have been empowered to do through nationalist sentiment.
",
813,0,," nationalism is a sense of fellow-feeling between group members .
",
814,0,," this promotes cooperation and social cohesion within the group .
",
815,0,," nationalism and the identity it brings creates a social glue which binds otherwise different people together , that sense of social cooperation makes welfare , social security and medical programs much more likely and stronger .
",
816,0,," it also may make for a smoother political process when there is a solid basis for consensus .
",
817,0,," those who are net contributors to the system need something to make them feel that what they are doing is worthwhile and in their interests ; something a national identity provides as it creates a sense of belonging that transcends economic interests .
",
818,0,," in canada for example those who strongly identify with canada are much more likely to support redistribution and healthcare than those with low identification with canada .
",
819,0,," societies with a healthy sense of nationalism are more likely to provide for each other and avoid the plight of poverty or poor health .
",
820,0,," nationalism has been a potent force for self-determination in colonial territories .
",
821,0,," the profoundly misunderstood vietnamese independence movement , as well as most african liberation movements of the 1940s and 1950s drew heavily on the idea of nationhood to mobilise their people against a foreign exploitative power .
",
822,0,," other examples include india , indonesia , guinea , and guyana .
",
823,0,," most often these states , once independence has been achieved , see a fracturing of nationalism that prevents those nationalist impulses from being used to condone violence against minority populations .
",
824,0,," meanwhile in big multi-ethnic states , most notably india and indonesia nationalism has been used positively to keep the state and its many ethnicities united my making a higher level of identity above the regional identities that in many other areas of the world would have become a national identity .
",
825,0,," nationalism can take many benign forms , such as that of civic nationalism , where a shared sense of national identity is created and reinforced by institutions , not ethnicity or history .
",
826,0,," the starting point of civic nationalism is not an ethnic group but the state 's territorial borders .
",
827,0,," it focuses on citizenship , civic rights and legal codes where all citizens are equal .
",
828,0,," civic nationalism has taken firmest root in the united kingdom and the united states .
",
829,0,," this is an inclusive kind of nationalism that accepts any individual into its institutions .
",
830,0,," nationalism can provide cultural and political glue for strong democratic institutions that can win out over forms of ethnic exclusion or political repression .
",
831,0,," according to isaiah berlin , `` the ` physiognomies ' of cultures are unique : each presents a wonderful exfoliation of human potentialities in its own time and place and environment .
",
832,0,," we are forbidden to make judgments of comparative value , for that is measuring the incommensurable . ''
",
833,0,," a plurality of nations , especially in the modern era , can allow for cultural development and cultural exchange that benefits both parties .
",
834,0,," the human variety offered by national feeling makes the world a better place , through the diversity offered by the cultures that nationalism nurtures and protects .
",
835,1,,"a faith school is a school that is run by a religious group, such as the catholic church.
",
836,1,," in the uk and many other western liberal democracies, the status quo is that some state schools are allowed to be faith schools in exchange for a small financial contribution towards the running of the school by the religious group running the school.
",
837,1,," the religious group also has control over how many and which children it admits, including the freedom to ensure that the majority of its intake is of its faith.
",
838,1,," they must follow the national curriculum but there is a lot of scope for including their own values in the education they provide.
",
839,0,," in this debate, the proposition wishes to completely remove faith schools from the education system.
",
840,0,,"since education is something that the state is obligated to provide , any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state , even in private education .
",
841,0,," if religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state , which undermines the separation of religion and the state , which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy .
",
842,0,," even the archbishop of canterbury believes having greater separation of church and state would be beneficial arguing `` i think that the notion of the monarch as supreme governor has outlived its usefulness . ''
",
843,0,," this separation has to include the education of children .
",
844,0,," the state should not allow the education of a child to be polluted by what is tantamount to brainwashing .
",
845,0,," amartya sen argues `` under this system , young children are placed in the domain of singular affiliations well before they have the ability to reason about different systems of identification that may compete for their attention . ''
",
846,0,," instead they have to learn about all religions to encourage tolerance .
",
847,0,," it is totally acceptable for children to have religious education outside of school and to brought to places of worship but school is a place of education and they should be given an education that is not tainted by trying to ensure that they grow up with a certain attitude towards their religion .
",
848,0,," when the government allows religion to act on its behalf , it confuses the role of the state and the role of religious groups .
",
849,0,," as it stands , religious groups do not appear to be truly answerable to the state and , therefore , it is unclear whether they or the government are the higher authority .
",
850,0,," for example in the uk faith schools set their own admission standards and increasingly have control over their curriculum , which in other state funded schools is set by the government , as well as they are being converted to academies .
",
851,0,," this legislation would make it completely clear that the state is the ultimate authority .
",
852,0,," faith schools continuously perform better than normal schools .
",
853,0,," this creates a feeling amongst parents and children of wanting to be included in these faith schools .
",
854,0,," they are , however , excluded on the basis of their religion .
",
855,0,," this will create feelings of unfair exclusion , which will lead to animosity towards the religion running the school and , by extension , people of that religion .
",
856,0,," as a result of this% of people in the uk believe that there should be no state funding for faith schools .
",
857,0,," it would be easy to convert faith schools to normal schools .
",
858,0,," the majority of faith schools are already tied closely to the state education system making it easy to convert them into normal schools which are not faith based .
",
859,0,," much of the curriculum is the same or very similar so the change would not be difficult for teachers .
",
860,0,," in england for example therefaith schools that are also state schools andthat are academies .
",
861,0,," these schools would simply change to having the same systems as any other school and admission would become open to all .
",
862,1,,"the creative arts might be considered to include painting and sculpture but also drama, poetry and creative writing, dance, composition and music, and others.
",
863,1,," this will not focus on literature and other disciplines, such as history of art, where the main role is to analyze the creative output of others.
",
864,1,," instead the focus here is on those degrees that seek to train students to be practitioners of those disciplines rather than generalists with a focus on discussing them.
",
865,1,,"there are two possible approaches to this debate (in fact there are many but two are the most obvious).
",
866,1,," the first – and the one most clearly in the spirit of the motion – is that the creative arts add little to the economy directly and that if society is going to have universities, especially in those countries where they are funded through direct taxation, then students should be focusing on subjects that have a proven economic worth.
",
867,1,," although the arts do contribute financially to an economy, it tends not to be in the way that, say, languages, engineering or economics do.
",
868,1,," there is another aspect here, which leads into the second interpretation, that graduates of creative arts departments rarely make their living in that field; the competition is simply too fierce.
",
869,1,,"that brings us on to prop’s second choice for a definition, which is that if people really want to learn the creative arts then a university setting is not the right place to do so.
",
870,1,," stage schools and fine art colleges are often separate from universities and, even then, some argue that if someone has real talent, they should just get on with it.
",
871,1,," there are countless examples of people who have excelled in the arts who have no formal training and learnt their craft ‘on the job’.
",
872,1,,"the specific focus on the creative arts also poses some problems for proposition.
",
873,1,," if drama has to go, then why not philosophy – or for that matter large chunks of physics?
",
874,1,," very few graduates pursue their subject professionally and those who do tend to simply teach it to the next generation replicating the situation.
",
875,1,," as a result, if opposition accepts that, say, history has a place on the curriculum, because it is a useful way of training people’s minds, then why not train them as poets or ballerinas?
",
876,1,,"opposition has some strong arguments on this front – the arts directly generate more revenue than, say, english literature.
",
877,1,," many graduates go on to do jobs that don’t require any degree at all, let alone their particular degree – so, once again, why focus on this particular collection of degrees.
",
878,1,," opp’s strongest argument, however, is that society is about far more than cold economic data and that the arts add hugely to society in a way that is difficult to measure but would certainly be missed.
",
879,1,,"this then opens up two lines of attack.
",
880,1,," the first is that the university experience is, in and of itself, a net social benefit.
",
881,1,," latterly, it also raises the issue that having members of a society with certain skills enriches it even if those graduates never use the skills they have acquired professionally in later life.
",
882,1,,"debater’s note:this can be an interesting way of looking at what role higher education actually fulfills and what taxes are for in the relationship between economic benefit and the wider social health of a nation.
",
883,1,," a truly minimalist approach would only leave us with what are sometime called the old professions – medicine, law, engineering, teaching and academia.
",
884,1,," traditionally there would have been another slot on that list for the priesthood.
",
885,1,," that niche is probably now taken by it.
",
886,1,," however, it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate into an exchange about whether arts or science degrees are ‘harder’ by some objective standard.
",
887,1,," that’s really not the focus of this motion (and it’s rubbish as well) and, tempting though that particular intellectual cul-de-sac might be, it’s best avoided.
",
888,1,,"for the purposes of these notes it is assumed that society is making some collective expenditure on the provision of degrees.
",
889,1,," although in some countries this may not be explicit as the students incur the costs of their degree either up front or at a subsequent date, there is still an opportunity cost in terms of work that person could have been doing if they were not engaged in their studies.
",
890,0,," in those countries where the full costs of a degree are borne upfront by the students’ parents, the proposition may like to point out that parents are rarely wild about the idea that their child wishes to study poetry or dance as they do not believe that the expenditure will ever be recouped in income.
",
891,0,,"the median earning figure across arts degrees is , itself deceptive .
",
892,0,," the median in the us is $ 45,000 but this disguises the lower end of the scale , with% earning $ 30,000 a year or less .
",
893,0,," unlike education and social work which at least tend to have the consistency of a government salary , the arts are also fantastically unreliable as an employment sector .
",
894,0,," teachers and social workers may have comparatively low salaries but at least they can be assured of job security .
",
895,0,," the arts offers low and unstable wages , frequently at an ongoing expense to the taxpayer , when the jobs exist at all .
",
896,0,," as a result , encouraging the creative arts through university qualifications places both an initial and , potentially , ongoing cost on the rest of society .
",
897,0,," it also means that graduates are likely to be destined to long term financial instability because of a decision they made as a teenager .
",
898,0,," it is difficult to see who benefits from such an arrangement .
",
899,0,," the idea that the best place to learn an artform is a classroom is fantastically modern .
",
900,0,," the idea of teaching them at all is fairly recent .
",
901,0,," if ever there were an example of ` those who can , do ; those who ca n't , teach ' , then it 's the arts .
",
902,0,," novelists , poets , painters , dancers , composers , musicians and others have been learning from each other as they practiced their art for , quite literally , millennia .
",
903,0,," universities have to provide a range of courses , some of which are going to be more financially viable than others , that fine .
",
904,0,," however , investment in one area inevitably means that there are resources not being focused elsewhere .
",
905,0,," it 's not a huge factor but some subjects -- creative arts , theology and a few others do represent a ` back door ' into universities for those who did n't get the grades to get onto more demanding courses .
",
906,0,," those students still need to sleep , study and socialize somewhere -- in place of those who could have taken their places on engineering , medicine , economics or similar courses had the space been available .
",
907,0,," by keeping these courses , universities are turning away students for other disciplines and those studying the arts courses are learning in a way that may not be the most productive -- as mentioned in the previous argument .
",
908,0,," it 's difficult to see who wins .
",
909,1,,"creative commons licenses are a kind of copyright license that gives people the right to use, share, and expand upon artists’ work.
",
910,1,," they offer users of content significant protection against accusations of copyright infringement and are even believed by advocates to offer artists greater flexibility and profit potential than traditional copyright.
",
911,1,," detractors on the other hand worry that they serve only to erode artists’ control of their work and their potential to earn income from it because of its dissemination into the public space.
",
912,1,," as it is a new field, the full legal ramifications and doctrines of creative commons licenses remain in contention.
",
913,1,,"copyright is certainly not universal.
",
914,1,," for much of history ideas have been fair game to whoever could make use of them.
",
915,1,," the state would grant rights and monopolies on a case by case basis but this was as a reward or in return for benefit to the state not based upon inherent ideas of ownership.
",
916,1,," the invention of the printing press however meant that ideas could potentially travel much faster and made copying a work considerably easier so increasing demands for protection for the creator of a work.
",
917,1,," the first form of copyright statute was adopted in venice ingoverning printing licences and fromvenice also prohibiting publication of an author’s work without permission in an attempt to prevent abuses in the printing trade.
",
918,1,," it stated “it has been decreed that in future no printer in this city of ours shall dare to print or to sell printed copies of any work… if it is not made clear by original document… that the author of the work, or his immediate heirs, are content and desire that it should be printed and sold.”
",
919,1,,"  copyright has also always been used by governments to control information.
",
920,1,,"the first modern copyright law that gives rights to authors is generally considered to be the statute of anne from 1710.
",
921,1,," it was enacted because printing without consent was causing writers “very great detriment and [leading] too often to the ruin of them and their families” to prevent this the author “shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years” with the act was enforceable with fines.
",
922,1,," since this time copyright has become much broader and the length has often been increased.
",
923,1,," the system has gone worldwide but is now under threat from the internet and the ability to easily share things it brings.
",
924,1,,"the role of the state is still key in copyright as it is the only possible enforcer.
",
925,1,," but the increasing unenforceability of copyright has led to calls to alter the dynamics of copyright in the context of art which could mean forcing artists to release their work under creative commons licenses.
",
926,1,,"this examines the various arguments for a new regime of artistic property rights, in which a new baseline would be creative commons licenses rather than more traditional, stricter copyright protections.
",
927,0,," an individual 's idea only truly belongs solely to them so long as it rests in their mind alone .
",
928,0,," when they disseminate their ideas to the world they put them in the public domain , and should become the purview of everyone to use .
",
929,0,," artists and creators more generally , should not expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea they happen to have , since no such ownership right exists in reality .
",
930,0,," no one can own an idea .
",
931,0,," thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products .
",
932,0,," physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .
",
933,0,," ideas do not share the same order of protection even now because they exist in a different order to physical reality .
",
934,0,," however , some intellectual property is useful in encouraging investment and invention , allowing people to engage their profit motives to the betterment of society as a whole .
",
935,0,," to an extent one can also sympathize with the notion that creators deserve to accrue some additional profit for the labour of the creative process , but this can be catered for through creative commons non-commercial licenses which reserve commercial rights .
",
936,0,," these protections should not extend to non-commercial use of the various forms of arts .
",
937,0,," this is because art is a social good of a unique order , with its purpose not purely functional , but creative .
",
938,0,," it only has value in being experienced , and thus releasing these works through creative commons licenses allows the process of artistic experience and sharing proceeds unhindered by outmoded notions of copyright .
",
939,0,," the right to reap some financial gain still remains for the artists , as their rights still hold over all commercial use of their work .
",
940,0,," this seems like a fair compromise of the artist 's right to profit from their work and society right to experience and grow from those works .
",
941,0,," current copyright law assigns too many rights , automatically , to the creator .
",
942,0,," law gives the generator of a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse , except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements .
",
943,0,," making creative commons licenses the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of people 's defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like .
",
944,0,," the creative commons guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors .
",
945,0,," at base the default setting of somehow having absolute control means creators of work often do not even consider the reuse by others in the commons .
",
946,0,," the result is creation and then stagnation , as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator .
",
947,0,," mandating that art in all its forms be released under a creative commons licensing scheme means greater access to more works , for the enrichment of all .
",
948,0,," this is particular true in the case of `` orphan works '' , works of unknown ownership .
",
949,0,," fears over copyright infringement has led these works , which by some estimates account for% of all books , have led to huge amounts of knowledge and creative output languishing beyond anyone 's reach .
",
950,0,," a mix of confusion over copyright ownership and unwillingness of owners to release their works , often because it would not be commercially viable to do so , means that only% of all works currently protected by copyright are commercially available .
",
951,0,," releasing these works under creative commons licenses will spawn a deluge of enriching knowledge and creative output spilling onto the market of ideas .
",
952,0,," it would mark a critical advancement in the democratization and globalization of knowledge akin to the invention of the printing press .
",
953,0,," the nature of the internet and mass media on the 21st century is such that many artists can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them .
",
954,0,," wider use by other artists and laymen alike helps artistic works `` go viral '' and to gain major impact that allow the artist to generate a name for his or herself and to attain the levels of earnings conventional copyrights are meant to help artists generate but that ultimately hamstring them .
",
955,0,," a major example of this is the band nine inch nails , which opted into begin releasing its albums through the creative commons .
",
956,0,," creative commons licenses are so remarkable because they can be deployed by artists to expand their markets , and to profit even more from their greater recognition .
",
957,0,," after all , the artists still retain control of the commercial uses of their work and are guaranteed under creative commons licensing regulations to be credited by users of their content .
",
958,0,," giving undue artistic and distribution control to the artists through constricting and outmoded copyright may mean less significant reach and impact of the work .
",
959,0,," the state should thus facilitate the sharing by mandating the distribution of art of all kinds under creative commons licenses .
",
960,0,," the state incurs huge costs in monitoring for copyright infringement , in arresting suspected perpetrators , in imprisonment of those found guilty , even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that , once released to it , belonged to the public domain more or less .
",
961,0,," furthermore , the deterrent effect to copyright piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .
",
962,0,," in fact , the level of internet piracy of books , music , and films has increased dramatically year on year for several years , increasing by% inalone .
",
963,0,," this is because in many cases copyright laws are next to unenforceable , as the music and movie industries have learned to their annoyance in recent years , for example ninety percent of dvds sold in china are bootlegs while even western consumers are increasingly bypassing copyright by using peer to peer networks .
",
964,0,," only a tiny fraction of perpetrators are ever caught , and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it has done little to stop their incidence .
",
965,0,," copyright , in many cases , does not work in practice plain and simple .
",
966,0,," releasing works under a creative commons licensing scheme does a great deal to cope with these pressures .
",
967,0,," in the first instance it is a less draconian regime , so individuals are more willing to buy into it as a legitimate claim by artists rather than an onerous stranglehold on work .
",
968,0,," this increases compliance with the relaxed law .
",
969,0,," secondly , the compliance means that artists are given the vocal crediting under the license rules that gives them more public exposure than clandestine copying could not .
",
970,0,," ultimately this adaptation of current copyright law would benefit the artist and the consumer mutually .
",
971,1,,"poetry is a literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic an evocative qualities as well as the language's normal meaning.
",
972,1,," poetry dates back as far as any literature, to the first civilization in mesopotamia with the sumerian epic gilgamesh.
",
973,1,," it undoubtedly has a long pedigree but that does not mean it should be taught in schools.
",
974,1,," can we justify keeping this subject obligatory for failing schools and schools under special measures?
",
975,1,," at the moment poetry is part of the english national curriculum where only essential skills, often called the three r's are considered essential.
",
976,1,," these are reading, writing and arithmetic.
",
977,1,," none the less unlike the skills these subjects mostly teach it cannot be considered a life skill.
",
978,1,," poetry unlikely to be necessary for daily life after a student has left school.
",
979,0,," poetry is currently taught at all levels of education from primary school up until students are allowed to drop key subjects after gcses.
",
980,0,,"it is like asking a student who can not count to solve a highly complex algebraic equation ; completely impossible because the groundwork remains a nemesis .
",
981,0,," if the pupils can not understand the basics of reading , writing and grammar , they will certainly struggle to with more complex concepts fundamental to the study of poetry such as similies , personifications , metaphors and extended metaphors .
",
982,0,," let us take the uk as an example , for it is a country in which many students do not make progress in basic english .
",
983,0,," a report invoiced concern at the number of school children struggling with english and the published some horrifying statistics ; `` hundreds of thousands of pupils are falling behind in the basics after starting secondary school , official figures suggest ... three inare not making enough progress in english , according to department for education data .160,000 did not make enough progress in english . ''
",
984,0,," in the uk , the labour party introduced the literacy hour , a programme that meant schools were obliged to dedicate more time to basic literacy , and numeracy , upon their election in.
",
985,0,," however , as the aforementioned statistics have shown , all that has increased is the number of pupils failing in this basic subject .
",
986,0,," there aremillion illiterate people in scotland alone .
",
987,0,," all we know is that more time does need to be spent learning the basic literacy and numeracy .
",
988,0,," appreciating literature and poetry , the artistic side of the english language , can not be addressed until learners have fully understood and grasped the tools of reading , writing and vowel sounds that allow for fiction and poetry to be produced .
",
989,0,," we need an educational programme that recognises reading and writing as a matter of urgency and literary and poetry appreciation as a luxury in order to reduce the number of illiterate pupils .
",
990,1,,"the outing of gay celebrities is a difficult debate based around the balancing of societal benefit from the act with the rights of individuals to retain their right to privacy over their sexual orientation.
",
991,1,," many gay rights activists support the act with websites such as “queer attitude” and “famous and gay” publicizing openly gay people in the public sphere, and continue to push for further exposure.
",
992,1,," counter to this, groups such as the even the gay, lesbian and allies senate staff caucus in the united states remain fundamentally opposed to the outing of gay celebrities and politicians.
",
993,1,," this exists in a situation where we ask the question not if it’s good for people to out themselves, but if we have the right to out individuals who have chosen not to already.
",
994,0,," outing gay celebrities puts the fight for gay equality in the fore of political discussion by removing the capacity for opposition to pass it off as a `` minority '' problem that is not of utmost concern .
",
995,0,," by outing gay celebrities we do two things .
",
996,0,," first , we both get rid of the narrative that says that being gay is uncommon and `` weird '' , which has been one of the ways right-wing parties have been able to prejudice the public against the gay rights movements .
",
997,0,," second , due to the public nature and high exposure of these individuals , it pushes the issue directly into the political spotlight , removing the ability of politicians to deny its significance or avoid discussing it as a pressing issue for legislation .
",
998,0,," by doing these two things , we propel the issue of gay rights into the political domain and help to shatter the harmful narratives opposition parties have fabricated to quell the struggle for equal rights .
",
999,0,," celebrities are uniquely placed to help break down misunderstanding and prejudice against the gay community .
",
1000,0,," one of the biggest obstacles to breaking down prejudice is the fact that people do not associate with the cause and can view it as alien and a problem that `` they '' have , not one that `` we '' can understand .
",
1001,0,," celebrities are uniquely placed to help bridge this gap and foster sympathy and understand about the fight for gay rights because of the relationship they foster with people in society .
",
1002,0,," people feel as though they have an emotional connection and familiarity with the people who are rocketed into their family rooms through their tv every night .
",
1003,0,," this level of familiarity means that when they are outed as gay leads to a breakdown of the idea that gay rights are an issue for `` them '' as it 's an issue that now directly affects you .
",
1004,0,," moreover , the emotional connection you feel you have with the characters these people play , means that you personalize their situation more than you would with any other form of gay rights activism .
",
1005,0,," therefore , outing gay celebrities fosters a particular type of sympathy and understanding for the cause that can not be achieved any other way .
",
1006,0,," celebrities have a special obligation to society because their success and lives are directly created and maintained by society .
",
1007,0,," celebrities are products of the society that admires them , and so as a result they owe a particularly high duty to that society .
",
1008,0,," as a result , they have an obligation to help that community and whatever way they possibly can in return for the fact that their existence and success is facilitated by them .
",
1009,0,," if gay celebrities do not out themselves to help the cause of an oppressed group in society , the society that has created them and their success has the right to do it for them .
",
1010,0,," celebrities have limited rights to privacy when that privacy conflicts with the well-being of the individuals who create their success and celebrity status in the first place .
",
1011,0,," therefore , the outing of gay celebrities is something that society is entitled to do as the lack of outing themselves breaks their obligation to the society that created them .
",
1012,1,,"aroundgerman inventor johannes gutenberg invented one of the most important and influential inventions of the second millennium, the printing press, and it was from the advent of this technology that the newspaper was born.
",
1013,1,," newspapers went from strength to strength and they became an important part of democracy.
",
1014,1,," george washington instated that: “for my part i entertain a high idea of the utility of periodical publications; insomuch as i could heartily desire, copies of ... magazines, as well as common gazettes, might be spread through every city, town, and village in the united states.
",
1015,1,," i consider such vehicles of knowledge more happily calculated than any other to preserve the liberty, stimulate the industry, and ameliorate the morals of a free and enlightened people.”
",
1016,1,," 1 in the 21st century, however, with the availability of other forms of media, such as tv and the internet, the once highly important newspaper entered a state of significant and rapid decline in many places across the world with readerships entering a seemingly never-ending downward spiral.
",
1017,1,," this has left many commentators to suggest that newspapers are a thing of the past, phillip meyer in the vanishing newspaper suggests, by extrapolation of current trends, that by the first quarter ofthe newspaper industry in the us will be completely extinct.
",
1018,1,," others suggest, however, that this is overstating the decline of newspapers, it could be suggested that there will always be a demand for printed word despite the current decline, for example in the uk on the 26th octoberthe first daily newspaper to be launched foryears hit the shelves and as of aprilthe “i” newspaper had a regular readership of over 160,000 2 suggesting that perhaps that some demand still exists.
",
1019,1,," what is most certainly true of newspapers today is that they are, in the developed world at least, losing their readerships, however, does this necessarily mean that there is no longer a place for them in the modern media landscape, are newspapers dead or are the rumors of their death greatly exaggerated?
",
1020,0,," with the development of digital video recorders , dvrs , and more generally the internet people have come to no longer simply consume media in a linear fashion , they take a more fragmented approach .
",
1021,0,," in news consumption people no longer want to simply have one newspaper with a vast array of topics inside .
",
1022,0,," they want to pick and choose which stories and columns they consume , people now prefer to pull the content they want rather than have it pushed on them .
",
1023,0,," in a digital world the news consumer can become their own editor and no longer need to rely entirely on old hierarchical structures .
",
1024,0,," in an interconnected global world whereby technology allows us within seconds to communicate across the globe in a variety of forms the newspaper medium becomes obsolete .
",
1025,0,," in the time it takes to write , edit , print and distribute a newspaper the events being covered may very well have changed , when we have the technology to overcome this problem it seems unlikely that newspapers will continue to exist because who wants to read old news ?
",
1026,0,," an example of newspapers not being able to adapt to changing events can be seen with the killing of osama bin laden on 2nd may, the story broke too late for the morning newspapers in the uk to be able to change their pages to include the story , it was then subsequently reported a day late on the 3rd may .
",
1027,0,," newspapers have no place in the modern media landscape as they are not environmentally friendly , they are a waste of paper when there are many other my efficient ways in which news can be disseminated .
",
1028,0,," for example a single annual subscription to the new york times roughly generates 520lb of waste which equates to approximately 4.25 trees being cut down per reader per year, when you take into account all the other publications that printed throughout the world this equates to a lot of wastage of increasingly scarce natural resources which could be avoided .
",
1029,0,," using digital tools to distribute news is more efficient as you only use resources when the content is actually required rather than the print media method in which the product is printed when it may not be necessarily purchased and consumed .
",
1030,0,," in the internet age , newspapers are no longer financially profitable businesses .
",
1031,0,," they are struggling to encourage investment and to survive in the long-term .
",
1032,0,," revenue is falling across the three main streams available to newspapers : sales , advertising and subscriptions .
",
1033,0,," sales and subscriptions are dropping as consumers move to the internet for information , often the website of the newspaper themselves !
",
1034,0,," , 1 advertising is not as profitable either , as increasingly advertisers look to pop-up systems on websites and buying space on search engines .
",
1035,0,," many newspapers have resorted to cutting costs , firing staff , reducing the length of the paper , and raising prices .
",
1036,0,," yet it does not seem likely that people will be willing to pay more for less .
",
1037,1,,"rupert murdoch’s news corporation is a multinational media corporation with interests in books, cable and satellite television, films, magazines, newspapers and websites.
",
1038,1,," it is influential around the world and in its portfolio news corporation includes very influential channels and publications.
",
1039,1,," fox news is perhaps the best known of these for its right wing perspective in the united states while in the uk the sun, a tabloid newspaper, claimed to have won theelection for john major proclaiming it was ‘the sun wot won it’.
",
1040,1,," as a result of this perception of influence politicians from around the world have wooed rupert murdoch in the hope that he will have his media organisations support their party in elections.
",
1041,1,,"news corporation has been involved in an on-going scandal about hacking into the phones of celebrities, politicians and other people who were in the news in order to obtain stories which initially came to light inwhen clive goodman the news of the world royal editor and glen mulcaire, a private investigator were arrested.
",
1042,1,," however despite it coming out that numerous public figures were hacked the allegations were not followed up.
",
1043,1,," however inwith new investigations and revelations of much more extensive phone hacking in rival newspapers such as the guardian news international accepted that it was in some cases liable for breaches of privacy and offered an unreserved apology.
",
1044,1,," the leveson inquiry was launched onjuly into the role of the press and police in the phone hacking scandal and the regulation of the press.
",
1045,1,," at the same time the commons committee on culture, media and sport was investigating whether the committee had been misled by witnesses during the phone hacking scandal.
",
1046,1,," it published its conclusions on 1st may 2012.
",
1047,1,,"behind this question is both a general question of whether murdoch is a fit person to be running such a large and influential media conglomerate around the world or whether he has been misusing that power and a more local context within the uk.
",
1048,1,," in the uk the broadcasting acts ofand ofcharges upon ofcom, the media and communications watchdog, the duty to distribute broadcasting licences and says ofcom “shall not grant a licence to any person unless they are satisfied that he is a fit and proper person to hold it”.
",
1049,1,," however the broadcasting acts do not define exactly what is ‘fit and proper’ but the actions of controlling directors and shareholders are taken into account; as such murdoch could threaten the ability of the companies he controls to be considered fit.
",
1050,0,," those running media corporations should be morally upright people who control their media companies in the public interest as these are organisations that potentially have a lot of influence through their control of information .
",
1051,0,," this is however not at all how rupert murdoch ran news corp or his newspapers .
",
1052,0,," murdoch has been running his empire in pursuit of power and to advance a right wing agenda .
",
1053,0,," his influence was such that even naturally left wing parties such as new labour under tony blair stuck to right wing or wing orthodoxies in order to keep the support of the murdoch press .
",
1054,0,," murdoch was therefore pushing narrow interests rather than the public interest .
",
1055,0,," murdoch 's news corporation has shown their lack of moral scruples not just by engaging in industrial scale hacking but also by its determination to use its contacts to close down investigations by parliament or the police as well as being willing to destroy evidence and lie when giving evidence .
",
1056,0,," tom watson mp has gone so far as to accuse murdoch of being `` the first mafia boss in history who did n't know he was running a criminal enterprise '' .
",
1057,0,," the attitude of the person at the top towards how their company and its staff should conduct themselves informs how they do conduct themselves and engage in their business .
",
1058,0,," it is the owners and the management that create the corporate culture which in murdoch tabloids meant profits at all costs and doing anything to get a story .
",
1059,0,," rupert murdoch has an immense empire and if we believe his testimony obviously did not have as much control over his publications , or take as much responsibility for them , as he should have done .
",
1060,0,," murdoch himself has claimed `` someone took charge of a cover-up we were victim to and i regret that . ''
",
1061,0,," this was a cover up within the news of the world and news international that kept murdoch out of the loop and misinformed on phone hacking , showing that he was unable to keep control over his businesses when he was the one with ultimate responsibility for the actions of that company .
",
1062,0,," the commons culture committee concluded that murdoch was essentially negligent `` at all relevant times rupert murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone-hacking , he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications . ''
",
1063,0,," the media 's role is to increase transparency and bring others to account .
",
1064,0,," murdoch himself in his testimony to leveson said `` if we 're a transparent society , a transparent democracy , let 's have it out there '' yet he has been exactly the opposite in terms of accountability and transparency .
",
1065,0,," the house of commons select committee on culture , media and sport has published a report in which it concludes that the culture of the publication , news of the world , was `` throughout , until it was too late , was to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators , as they also professed they would do after the criminal convictions . ''
",
1066,0,," the strategy was to blame individuals and when such a containment strategy failed to shut down the news of the world so as to protect top bosses .
",
1067,0,," news international was clearly not living up to high standards of transparency .
",
1068,1,,"international adoption is the adoption of foreign children and their subsequent immigration into their adopted parents' home nation.
",
1069,1,," with the on-going media coverage of ill-treated children in chinese and romanian orphanages and the increasing numbers of infertile couples in the developed world, proponents of international adoption claim it appears to solve two problems at once.
",
1070,1,," however, recently romania has stopped all international adoptions amid claims of corruption and human trafficking.
",
1071,1,," similar stories have clouded adoptions from guatemala.
",
1072,1,," despite these difficulties international adoptions by us citizens have tripled in the pastyears and legislation has been passed to make it easier for these adopted children to obtain citizenship.
",
1073,1,," the numbers of international adoptions now reach as many as 45,000 worldwide.
",
1074,1,," opponents argue however that some children complain of a feeling of cultural dislocation and reject claims such cases are exceptions to the general sentiment of delight with their new homes and dual identity.
",
1075,0,," the long-term effects of such migrations are hard to predict but many opponents call for more efforts to be made to house children in their country of birth, with proper support for domestic orphanages and adoption schemes.
",
1076,0,,"couples who have made the decision to adopt a child should not be restricted in their choice to their country of residence .
",
1077,0,," it may be in the state 's interest to reduce the number of children in their own institutions , however there is no reason citizens should be straddled with this obligation .
",
1078,0,," we do not prevent our adults from marrying foreign nationals and granting them citizenship ; why would we do so for children ?
",
1079,0,," furthermore , if the conditions of the couples ' state 's institutions are fairly good , they have a strong altruistic motive to adopt from a nation which does not fund its own institutions similarly .
",
1080,0,," unwanted or orphaned children living in squalid conditions in the developing world should be the priority for couples seeking to adopt , not those living in the local orphanage who , whilst hoping for a permanent home , will not starve .
",
1081,0,," international adoption therefore would provide a small but tangible means of reducing the infant mortality of many of these struggling states .
",
1082,1,,"in a landmark ruling, the us supreme court ruled 6-3 in vernonia school district v. acton that schools could randomly test student athletes for drug use, after a student, james acton, was banned from trialling for his school football team without consenting to a test.
",
1083,1,," the legal battle for the school’s right to drug-test has gained and lost ground for many years in the usa; inthe united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in todd v. rush county schools  upheld an indiana school board program that banned students from participation in extracurricular activities without first passing a random drugs test.
",
1084,1,," this was however later struck down as being against state constitutional law.
",
1085,1,," and inthe tenth circuit in willis v. anderson community school corporation ruled that tests imposed unreasonable searches upon students in violation of fourth amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.
",
1086,1,,"a study conducted in the united kingdom inby the independent inquiry into drug testing at work found that attempts by employers to force employees to take drug tests could potentially be challenged as a violation of privacy under the uk human rights act and articleof the european convention of human rights.
",
1087,1,,"this should focus on society’s desire to combat what it perceives as a growing drug abuse problem, pitted against children and families’ right to privacy.
",
1088,1,," tests can be conducted on urine, hair, breath or occasionally blood.
",
1089,0,," there is a clear and present problem with drug use among children and teenagers in many countries .
",
1090,0,," according to the uk department of health , in 2002-2003% ofyear olds had used illegal drugs , as had% ofyear olds .
",
1091,0,," the fact that all of these children would have been in schools at the age ofshows that current policies of targeting the supply train of drugs , for example by arresting drug dealers and intercepting drug shipments , is failing to protect children .
",
1092,0,," therefore a more direct approach that intervenes at the point of consumption is needed , most crucially for children and teenagers , as their years in education are crucial for both their personal development and their realization of their future education and employment potential .
",
1093,0,," drug use at a young age may lead to lifelong use and addiction .
",
1094,0,," random drug testing in schools will allow for vulnerable children 's drug problems to be discovered , and assist the state in getting them the help they need to get off drugs .
",
1095,0,," random testing is especially valuable in this scenario because many infant and teenage drug users will try to disguise their drug use from parents and teachers and so avoid detection through avoiding suspicion , a tactic which will prove of no use against random drug tests which will likely affect all students at one point or another .
",
1096,0,," it should also deter many students from starting taking drugs in the first place as the prospect of them being caught becomes far more likely , as they know disguising their drug use will be of no use .
",
1097,0,," peer pressure drives most drug use among children and teenagers .
",
1098,0,," the fact that the state requires all children to be engaged in education means that most of them will be gathered into large groups in schools for most of the day , five days a week , essentially creating the necessary conditions for peer pressure to take place and be powerful .
",
1099,0,," this occurs as some children face ostracism or exclusion from their peers in the social environment that the state compels them to be in if they refuse to take illegal drugs , if drug use is deemed necessary to be ` cool ' or ` popular ' .
",
1100,0,," it is , generally , the state that operates a western liberal democracy 's education system .
",
1101,0,," under circumstances in which children are placed into the care of the state , and are made vulnerable to peer pressure the state has a duty to ensure that children are not coerced into using drugs .
",
1102,0,," this means that concerns of ` privacy ' are secondary to protecting the choice not to take drugs , as ensuring the ` privacy ' of all students by not having random drug tests empowers some students to socially coerce other students into using drugs when they otherwise would not .
",
1103,0,," random drug tests help prevent cultures or norms of drug-taking , by which it can become the ` cool ' thing to do , by ensuring that most drug users will be caught and helped to quit , thus protecting the choice of others not to be pressured into drug use .
",
1104,0,," random drug tests will pose no harm to students who do not use illegal drugs , as they have nothing to fear from this fact being certified .
",
1105,0,," if anything it serves as a vindication of their law-abidance and good character .
",
1106,0,," random drug tests will only catch those who are actively taking drugs , as tests can be used which are unlikely to make a ` positive ' reading from secondary exposure , for example , being near someone else smoking cannabis .
",
1107,0,," those actively taking drugs need help in getting off drugs far more urgently than they need their right to ` privacy ' , as addiction at a young age could have a significant negative impact upon the remainder of their time in education .
",
1108,0,," therefore , non-drug users have nothing to fear from testing .
",
1109,0,," as a result random checks are in the best interests of drug users .
",
1110,1,,"reverence and veneration of the national flag has long been profound in the united states, possibly more so than in many other countries.
",
1111,1,," this reverence has led many state legislatures as well as the federal congress to pass legislation banning the burning of the flag.
",
1112,1,," such legislation generally follows similar language, effectively banning the desecration of the national flag in protests, or other acts of desecration.
",
1113,1,," so far these bans have been struck down by the supreme court, which indescribed them as contrary to the principle of free speech.
",
1114,1,," nonetheless, popular support for such a ban remains high.
",
1115,1,," proponents of a ban argue that the special symbolic value of the flag to the american people is such that it must be protected by law, and that the right to free speech does not extend to the desecration of the emblem of the nation.
",
1116,1,," opponents contend that banning flag burning curtails a form of free speech and undermines the ability of people to protest the policies of the state.
",
1117,0,," debates on the issue of flag burning usually revolve around the significance of the flag as a symbol of the nation, the value of flag burning as a means of protest, and on the extent to which free speech should be protected in society.
",
1118,0,,"when destroying the flag of the united states it is the values of the united states that are under attack .
",
1119,0,," since the birth of the nation the flag of the united states , the eponymous `` star-spangled banner '' , has been flown proudly in all parts of the country .
",
1120,0,," it has become an endemic fixture in american culture and has come to be seen by people all over the united states , and the world , as a representation of the spirit and identity of nation .
",
1121,0,," it appears on every seal of public office , is flown outside every public building and a flag-shaped pin is worn upon the breast of virtually every public figure .
",
1122,0,," the flag has been imbued with a special significance by the citizens of the united states , and is viewed almost universally with extensive reverence1 .
",
1123,0,," it has come to be seen as emblematic of all the values and virtues of american society .
",
1124,0,," in a way it is the physical sublimation of those values ; at least that is how it is often treated .
",
1125,0,," for this reason , to destroy the flag is to destroy the values they represent , and thus the flag must be protected in order to protect the values of the nation the flag represents .

",
1130,0,," freedom of speech and expression is an important right , which is why it is listed first in the bill of rights ; it is central to a fair and free democracy .
",
1131,0,," however , it has limits .
",
1132,0,," some forms of speech are contrary to the values of democracy , namely when they infringe upon or violate the ability of others to enact their own rights and freedoms .
",
1133,0,," this is why such things as incitement to hatred , other violence-promoting speech , as well as defamation and perjury are legislated against ; they are expressions that infringe the rights of others , by causing fear and increasing risk of harm in case of hate speech , and by harming reputations and the effective administration of justice in terms of defamation and perjury respectively .
",
1134,0,," rights stop where harm to others begins .
",
1135,0,," in the case of flag burning , as the dissenting opinion of justice william rehnquist on the issue says , the act is an extremely visceral one , and is often perceived as a direct attack on the core values of america itself , which many consider to be representative of those values , leading to feelings of anger and violation1 .
",
1136,0,," it is an infringement of these offended people 's rights when flags are allowed to be burned .

",
1140,0,," lawrence : university press of kansas .
",
1141,0,," it is highly questionable whether burning a flag can be considered a speech or expressive act at all .
",
1142,0,," it seems to offer up no new concepts or true opinions to the `` marketplace of ideas '' .
",
1143,0,," nothing is genuinely expressed by the act that could not be done through words or other , less fiery means .
",
1144,0,," the act of flag burning does nothing to help the advancement or elucidation of truth , which is why people have the right to freedom of expression in the first place .
",
1145,0,," rather , it clouds the issue supposedly being furthered by the act .
",
1146,0,," it welcomes the rhetoric of `` un-americanism '' , whereby critics and commentators question the protestors ' general patriotism , not the validity of their underlying cause , which can eventually lead to the same criticism of their cause itself .
",
1147,0,," anger clouds the discussion , with people viewing the cause in terms of unpatriotic people supporting the cause , and thus calling for patriots to oppose it .
",
1148,0,," examples of this problem can be seen clearly in the various protests during the vietnam war in which misguided protestors burned flags to show their opposition to the war and killing of innocents .
",
1149,0,," the response to these protests , however , were accusations of lack of patriotism on the parts of those involved and gave a powerful rhetorical tool to the political groups still supporting the fight1 .
",
1150,0,," furthermore , when anger and rhetoric cloud all discussion of an issue , it can lead to unmeasured , even violent responses from authorities and concerned citizens .
",
1151,0,," flag burning is thus counterproductive as a tool of protest , since it stops the message being propagated and pollutes the forums of discourse from being able to search for answers reasonably .
",
1152,0,," all national polls conducted in the united states have shown a majority popular support for banning flag burning1 .
",
1153,0,," state and federal laws , passed by democratically elected representatives , have for decades passed popularly supported laws aimed at protecting the flag from desecration .
",
1154,0,," the supreme court , however , has struck down these laws as being contrary to the rights to free speech , by a narrow 5-4 vote2 .
",
1155,0,," yet popular support for such laws has not diminished .
",
1156,0,," this has led to attempts to pass a flag desecration amendment to the constitution , which would then necessarily have to be accepted by the court .
",
1157,0,," in, the house of representatives passed such an amendment by the requisite supermajority , and it died in the senate by only a single vote3 .
",
1158,0,," clearly , the vast majority of citizens and legislators actively support legislation to protect the flag .
",
1159,0,," law should reflect the will of the people and prevent the desecration of the nation 's most sacred symbol .
",
1160,0,," failing to do so gives precedence to the rights of a small minority to perform an act that does not hold any major sway over their lives over the democratic rights of the democratic public .
",
1161,1,,"a lottery is a form of gambling whereby lots are drawn and, depending on selections, prizes handed out.
",
1162,1,," many countries have lotteries which raise revenues for various levels of government as well as often providing a charitable donation to numerous worthy causes.
",
1163,1,," the lotteries are usually monopolies granted by the government to private companies who take a slice of the profits and turn the rest over to the state.
",
1164,1,," income from state lotteries is often devoted to special categories of spending, partly in order to make playing the game more attractive to the public; in the usa states often use lottery funds for education, in britain they are pledged to areas such as sport, the arts and charities.
",
1165,1,," most lotteries involve tickets purchased from local vendors, these may be pre-printed with digits or carry a selection of numbers chosen by the purchaser.
",
1166,1,," draws are usually made on national television with a frequency which varies from country to country, but in almost every case huge media and advertising attention surrounds the event.
",
1167,1,," proponents argue that lotteries provide unique, life-changing opportunities for winners whilst providing a source of revenue separate from traditional, antagonistic direct tax methods.
",
1168,0,," opponents maintain that national lotteries only serve to encourage and foster addictions to gambling and that it is an implicit taxation that in fact only works in favour of the already-wealthy.
",
1169,0,,"it is a widely known fact that a large proportion of the money made from selling lottery tickets goes directly to good causes and schemes run by the government to help improve the lives of the people who buy the tickets in the first place .
",
1170,0,," the national lottery , uk , was initially founded on the principle of providing funding for the arts , sport and heritage with funding for projects that would not otherwise get off the ground , and in recent years there has been a drive by the government to return the distribution of lottery money to those causes1 .
",
1171,0,," according to the official national lottery website , `` camelot already runs the most cost-efficient lottery in europe - an achievement that has helped the uk national lottery to generate over #billion for the good causes , and counting ``.
",
1172,0,," this is an incredible sum of money , made possible by the fact that government endorsement allows for greater awareness of the competition meaning more players and more money going to charity .
",
1173,0,," were the lottery to be de-nationalised , there would be no guarantee of these essential donations - the lottery would simply become another form of gambling which profits the organisers above all else .
",
1174,0,," if there exists a mechanism , like the national lottery , whereby a government can raise its revenue outside of having to directly tax its population , it is obligated to do so .
",
1175,0,," direct taxation is a burden on the population , reducing discretionary spending ; therefore governments should constantly be seeking to placate its populations by reducing the proportion of state revenue that comes from direct taxation .
",
1176,0,," a study by the north american association of state and provincial lotteries found that lottery sales raised $ 52.6 billion for states in.
",
1177,0,," if the state 's obligation is to look after the general interest of its population , which lie in lower direct tax rates as a proportion of total revenue , such a lucrative revenue stream can not be ignored at the expense of maintaining direct tax rates .
",
1178,1,,"the role of women in the family and the workplace has been an issue of great change and even greater implication throughout recent history.
",
1179,1,," changing social constructions of gender roles and family roles has led to a debate over the role of women in the home and the value or lack thereof placed upon it.
",
1180,1,," if the role of women is no longer always in the home should there be some compensation for those who do still agree to remain housewives (or very occasionally househusbands) in return for the work they do?
",
1181,1,," the debate over housewives being paid for their work is one of entitlement, economics and social engineering.
",
1182,1,,"  although this is a primarily a principled debate, one possible skeleton model for this case would be to propose that all housewives would be given equal salary from the government fund that is funded through tax payer dollars.
",
1183,1,," this would be carried out in the form of tax exemptions and tax rebates that would be doled out via the institutions and processes currently in place for tax returns, auditing etc. an example of this would be the internal revenue service in the united states or the canada revenue agency in canada.
",
1184,0,," the philosophical basis of entitlement for pay is derived from the notion that if something comes into being as the product of an individual 's labor , then that individual is entitled to the profit and benefit of such a product because its existence was resultant of that individual 's labor .
",
1185,0,," that in this case the labor is on services does not make any difference , the product of the housewife 's labor is that the children are looked after and domestic matters are all sorted .
",
1186,0,," this is beneficial to society as housewives in addition to helping their own family are likely to have the time to help out others -- through volunteering , through looking after other 's children after school etc, it is estimated that the value of a housemaker 's services would be equivalent to approximately # 30,000 per year .
",
1187,0,," in the same way that any product or service is created , offered or manufactured by individual workers , the services of home-keeping are delivered by the labor of the home-keeper .
",
1188,0,," just as all workers are entitled to remuneration for the goods and services they create , so is a housewife is so entitled for the house-keeping services they offer .
",
1189,0,," gender stereotypes dictate that the woman 's place is in the home and that that is an inferior position in the social hierarchy than that of the male 's corporate bread-winner status .
",
1190,0,," the stereotype is particularly damaging to women 's expectations for themselves and the way society treats women .
",
1191,0,," by paying housewives for their work , a greater emphasis is placed on the role of the home-keeper and on the women that tend to this job .
",
1192,0,," it elevates the position of women in the household by economically empowering them and giving them the very thing that usually implies the greater importance of the bread-winners in the family , economic power and status .
",
1193,0,," moreover , it elevates societal views of housewives and home-keepers by valuing their contributions to the household and society in a tangible , monetary way that society cares about .
",
1194,0,," paying housewives for their work grants greater social status and power to women and family lives , which improves views of women and the roles they take in the family .
",
1195,0,," one of the most important factors of oppression of women 's rights , particularly in the developing world , is dependence .
",
1196,0,," women are often confined to the home by force , lack of opportunity or social stigma , on behalf of their husbands .
",
1197,0,," when she is not paid , a housewife must rely on her husband for money , especially if she has children she is expected to take care of .
",
1198,0,," economic empowerment allows further freedom for women in countries where women are confined to the home .
",
1199,0,," by making women economic actors , you empower them to engage in different social structures and hold a stake and position in the centres of economic power .
",
1200,0,," this is the most empowering tool one can offer women in most countries around the world .
",
1201,0,," by paying housewives for their work , you offer one of the most powerful forms of social empowerment for women around the world .
",
1202,1,," common agricultural policy (cap) was founded in late 1950s as a mechanism against further food shortages in europe.
",
1203,1,," european leaders envisioned the cap as a system of subsidies for damaged agricultural industry still affected by residues of wwii with several main goals stated in the treaty of rome, article:1.
",
1204,1,,"     to increase productivity, by promoting technical progress and ensuring the optimum use of the factors of production, in particular labour;2.
",
1205,1,,"     to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community;3.
",
1206,1,,"     to stabilise markets;4.
",
1207,1,,"     to secure availability of supplies;5.
",
1208,1,,"     to provide consumers with food at reasonable prices.
",
1209,1,,"the ways how to reach these goals varied – several policies ranging from interventions of eu when the price of goods is under certain level to production quotas to avoid overproduction and direct subsidies paid to farmers.
",
1210,1,," however, these policies are only one part of cap as whole.
",
1211,1,," the second pillar of cap is the rural development programs aimed at improvement of competitiveness of agricultural and forestry sector, improving the environment and the countryside, diversification of rural economy and implementation of local development strategies through public-private partnerships.
",
1212,1,,".
",
1213,1,,"nonetheless, cap faced a lot of criticism during the years.
",
1214,1,," one of the main scandals were so-called mountains of butter and lakes of wine and milk which were in the 80s a result of eu purchasing the goods in order to maintain the reasonable market prices.
",
1215,1,," however, in recent years there were signs that the butter mountains can be back.
",
1216,1,," among other criticised aspects were the effects of cap on environment, unfairness to new member states of eu, hurting of smaller farms among others.
",
1217,1,," the critique escalated to such degree that insweden became first eu country to take position that all eu subsidies should be abolished.
",
1218,0,," currently cap costs the european union approx .
",
1219,0,," 40 % of its whole budget .
",
1220,0,," however , this money is used to provide subsidies for industry that only employs less than% of workforce and creates less than% of gdp .
",
1221,0,," we can easily assume that nearly half of eu 's budget can be used more effectively and can , instead , be used to support other , more potential industries which can boost the currently sluggish economic growth .
",
1222,0,," moreover , the subsidies for european farmers are so high they can contribute up to% of farmers ' pre-tax income .
",
1223,0,," no other industry has such privileges -- when european coal and iron industry became uncompetitive and needed to be slimmed down , the european union did not subsidise the industry to such degree even though such action could have saved thousands of jobs .
",
1224,0,," not only are the largest recipients of cap western countries -- france , spain and germany - also the payments per hectare of arable lands differ significantly between new and old members of eu .
",
1225,0,," the new members of eu with their economies often struggling and more dependent on agriculture , as is the case of poland , bulgaria or romania , need more monetary support compared to their western counterparts to produce food of same quality and be competitive in eu market .
",
1226,0,," however , the payments for hectare of land vary from$ in greece to less than$ in latvia .
",
1227,0,," these different conditions undermine the eu 's ethos of fairness and equality of countries .
",
1228,0,," the current model of cap results in major oversupply of food and beverages .
",
1229,0,," inthe stockpiles of cereals rising to810 tons while the surplus of wine was about 2.3 million hectolitres .
",
1230,0,," this excess of supply is then often sold to developing countries for prices so low that the local producers can not cope with them .
",
1231,0,," the low prices of european food can be attributed to the higher efficiency of producing food because of use of advanced technologies as well as the cap .
",
1232,0,," agriculture makes a small fraction of gdp in europe , but in developing countries of africa or asia it is entirely different with large numbers dependent on much smaller plots of land .
",
1233,0,," hence , the consequences of cap and high production in the eu can be the rise of unemployment and decline of self-sufficiency of these affected countries .
",
1234,0,," the cap as originally proposed was aimed to support small , local , family farmers which have difficulties with sustaining their business in competitive environment .
",
1235,0,," the conference in stresa inthat helped define cap 's objectives stated `` given the importance of family structures in european agriculture ... all means should be taken in order to strengthen the economic and competitive capacity of the family enterprise . ''
",
1236,0,," however , the current model of cap gives direct payments to farmers according to area of their farms .
",
1237,0,," that means that the major recipients of cap are actually the biggest players in agricultural industry .
",
1238,0,," according to economist ,% of the subsidies go to% of the richest farmers .
",
1239,0,," therefore , the money is spent to support large companies and wealthy landowners who could easily compete in eu market even without such abhorrent support from eu taxpayers .
",
1240,1,,"the world bank (2012) have provided data indicating, globally, 75% of the world’s poor are ‘unbanked’ - meaning 75% of the world’s poor do not have access to a bank account.
",
1241,1,," in sub-saharan africa the figure is 76% of adults (care, 2014).
",
1242,1,," the focus on banking has taken two key directions.
",
1243,1,," on the one hand, a focus has been placed on understanding the geography of the unbanked - who is unbanked, where, and why.
",
1244,1,," the multiple factors affecting access to banking have been identified.
",
1245,1,," for example, barriers identified by the world bank include poverty, inaccessibility to banks, and a banking supply issue.
",
1246,1,," on another hand, concern with a lack of banking has focused on the opportunities that being ‘banked’ creates.
",
1247,1,," whether the concern is on land, empowerment, and entrepreneurialism, banking has been identified as a means for poverty alleviation.
",
1248,1,," although the evidence remains open to debate.
",
1249,1,,"microfinance is one model used to enable the unbanked to access financial services - referring to the provision of money, credit, insurance, and savings.
",
1250,1,," microfinance is structured around the community and providing an alternative system to distribute loans.
",
1251,1,," the social policy model is based on the idea that access to small loans funding will make a difference to the everyday lives of the poor.
",
1252,1,," small loans should be provided into the community, which is able to organise and distribute loans, and through trust ensure flexible repayment schemes.
",
1253,1,," the model is argued to be responsive to the needs of women.
",
1254,1,,"microfinance schemes have been rolled out across africa - integrating informal, traditional finance groups with modern updates.
",
1255,1,," however, this debate looks at the evidence of whether microfinance schemes in africa are beneficial.
",
1256,1,," how has the geography of money - in terms of savings, spending and future investment - changed through microfinance?
",
1257,1,," what opportunities are emerging for those given access to microfinance?
",
1258,1,," is the organisation of microfinance working in the african context?
",
1259,1,," fundamentally, is providing finance to the ‘unbanked’ an effective solution to poverty?
",
1260,0,," the livelihoods approach provides a useful model to understand how poor people live ; and remains important to recognising the benefits of microfinance .
",
1261,0,," the provision of microfinance reduces vulnerability to shocks and changes such as losing a job ; enhances people 's access to assets that they use and need , such as finance , friend networks , and land , ; and this fundamentally acts to change the lives of the poor .
",
1262,0,," microfinance provides social protection through tapping into social capital .
",
1263,0,," further , microfinance means aid is not simply provided , but the individual is taught valuable financial skills and given the means to sustain themselves for their lifetime .
",
1264,0,," microfinance is empowering the communities that are using it - showing in development , small is beautiful .
",
1265,0,," communities are empowered to change their conditions .
",
1266,0,," for example taking the case of savings - microfinance allows for savings .
",
1267,0,," half of the adults that saved in sub-saharan africa , during, used an informal , community-based approach , care  .
",
1268,0,," first , having savings reduces household risk .
",
1269,0,," care is one of many organisations working in innovations for microfinance .
",
1270,0,," at care savings have been mobilised across africa by working with village savings and loans associations .
",
1271,0,," overtime , care has targeted over 30,000,000 poor people in africa , to provide necessary finance .
",
1272,0,," savings ensures households have financial capital , can invest resources in education , health , and the future .
",
1273,0,," savings is security in livelihoods .
",
1274,0,," second , microfinance is providing key skills .
",
1275,0,," oxfam 's savings for change initiative provides training on savings , and lending , to women in communities in senegal and mali .
",
1276,0,," evidence from mali indicates startup capital provided has ensured better food security , women 's empowerment in the financial decision-making of households , and crucially , a sense of community bond among the women , oxfam  .
",
1277,0,," gender based violence within households may also be reduced .
",
1278,0,," introducing finance provides communities with access to startup capital .
",
1279,0,," access to financial capital is vital in several respects for initiating capitalism .
",
1280,0,," firstly , access to capital enables entrepreneurialism .
",
1281,0,," the poor have business ideas that would benefit both themselves and their community they just require access to capital to invest in such ideas .
",
1282,0,," the initiative ` lend with care ' is providing access to capital to empower entrepreneurs .
",
1283,0,," secondly , the cumulative effect of small-scale savings and borrowing , enabled through microfinance enables individuals , families and communities , to enter markets - of land and property .
",
1284,0,," being able to buy property and land can enable personal security , dignity , and increasing returns .
",
1285,0,," africa is faced with an agrarian crisis .
",
1286,0,," microfinance is providing rural communities a chance to gain food security and reduce vulnerability to risks such as climate change , unstable demand , and political tensions .
",
1287,0,," microfinance supports small scale agriculture -- which is more sustainable , effective for growth , and beneficial for communities than larger scale agriculture .
",
1288,0,," in zimbabwe , small scale farming has the capability to improve production , benefiting households , communities , and the nation , irin ,; morrison  .
",
1289,0,," kiva , a microfinance ngo , is providing affordable capital to remote communities .
",
1290,0,," loans have been provided to small-scale farmers and a rental system has been set-up enabling farmers to borrow tools and resources needed .
",
1291,0,," access to a small loan provides benefits for the poor 's ability to access high quality health care .
",
1292,0,," a lack of access to banking facilities - loans and credit - may mean the poor are left excluded from health care services as these are usually not free .
",
1293,0,," microfinance institutions accept the irregularities of the poor 's income , so enabling health care to be affordable to the poor by providing access to finance .
",
1294,0,," as ofori-adjei  shows the integration of microfinance institutions within healthcare systems in ghana is required to resolve the issue of inaccessibility .
",
1295,0,," ill health should not put a household into a state of poverty - microfinance provides this protection .
",
1296,0,," microfinance schemes not only provide loans to access health care but are now integrating non-financial services , such as health education , within their finance schemes .
",
1297,1,,"one of the biggest and most influential industries in the world is the oil business; oil companies areof the world’sbiggest public companies andof the topby sales, and these are not even the world’s biggest oil companies; state owned ones are bigger.
",
1298,1,," these companies are therefore clearly influential, they have a lot of money to spend and they can potentially transform the fortunes of a country if they decide to invest.
",
1299,1,,"to make matters worse oil companies go where the oil is, which will often mean working in the poorest countries; those least able to exercise control over the industry.
",
1300,1,," these are also countries for whom the striking of oil wealth can have a transformative effect.
",
1301,1,," a small impoverished country can become (technically) wealthy overnight if there is a large strike of oil on their territory.
",
1302,1,," there is immediately a problem of what to do with this wealth.
",
1303,1,," the wealth is in the ground, a foreign company will need to dig it up and sell the oil passing money on to the country.
",
1304,1,," yet the country has no expertise to manage a bidding process and little leverage over the companies once they begin drilling beyond killing the golden goose.
",
1305,1,,"oil wealth does not automatically solve a country’s problems.
",
1306,1,," indeed there are many poor countries with large oil reserves an example of this is equatorial guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty.
",
1307,1,," this is because all the oil wealth goes into the hands of the country’s dictator teodoro obiang nguema and his cronies.
",
1308,1,," the question is how can such a situation be avoided?
",
1309,1,," one suggestion has been that the money that comes from oil wealth – which may come directly from a state owned oil company or taxes on the production from private companies as a result of the oil being a state resource (the usa is the only country where the resources underground is entirely private) – should be put in an independent fund.
",
1310,1,," this is what norway does.
",
1311,1,," this fund would be out of reach of politicians and only give back a certain amount per year – such as just the profit from the investments.
",
1312,0,," the wealth from oil , or other natural resources , holds back democratization as a result of the `` resources curse '' or `` paradox of plenty '' .
",
1313,0,," resources provide money , and money is what is needed to run a security state .
",
1314,0,," when money can come from natural resources there is little need to tax the people , instead it becomes a `` rentier '' economy where the dictator has resources to buy support without recourse to taxation .
",
1315,0,," it is essentially the opposite of the well-known idea ` no taxation without representation ' ; if the money comes not from taxes but from oil what need is there for democracy ?
",
1316,0,," this proposal takes away the option of having access to large oil revenues instead providing only a limited amount to the state rather than the pockets of the dictator .
",
1317,0,," this prevents the buying of key groups such as the army and the policy who can be used to repress the population .
",
1318,0,," it is not by chance that the only countries in the arab middle east that could be considered democracies before the arab spring never had oil ; jordan and lebanon .
",
1319,0,," environmental damage is an example of the ` tragedy of the commons ' where if a resource is not owned by an individual , or is free to all , then it will be overexploited .
",
1320,0,," this is because it is in everyone 's self-interest to use it as much as possible .
",
1321,0,," the result is pollution ; politicians and oil companies want to exploit the oil as cheaply as possible so they dump pollution on the local population .
",
1322,0,," for example , the $billion ruling handed down last year by a court in lago agrio , a town near ecuador 's border with colombia , held chevron accountable for health and environmental damages resulting from chemical-laden wastewater dumped fromto .
",
1323,0,," putting oil wealth into a trust fund can help prevent this kind of abuse .
",
1324,0,," there are two reasons for this .
",
1325,0,," first if politicians are not getting an immediate benefit they will be less inclined to overlook pollution and there wo n't be money to buy support for drilling and pollution to continue .
",
1326,0,," the second is that since the fund is meant to provide long term benefits and investments one of the things it can be doing is being devoted to cleaning up any pollution that is created thus protecting the future generations .
",
1327,0,," it is very tempting to recklessly use an unexpected windfall of money immediately .
",
1328,0,," but the best thing to do is to invest for the long term either to build infrastructure that will pay back its cost in future economic growth , or to invest it in funds that will continue paying dividends long into the future .
",
1329,0,," the example of how britain and norway spent their north sea oil revenues is very revealing : `` the british governments spent their north sea winnings on cutting national borrowing and keeping down taxes .
",
1330,0,," whatever came in went straight into the day-to-day budget .
",
1331,0,," by contrast , for the pastyears norway has squirreled away the government 's petroleum revenue in a national oil fund ''  which now has $billion in assets , almost twice the country 's gdp , providing% returns .
",
1332,0,,"  the advantage of such investment is that they will continue to bring income even after the oil is gone .
",
1333,0,," the oil will therefore benefit future generations as well as the current one .
",
1334,0,," a panel of experts which are immune to political influence is the most likely body to think about long-term needs of the country and devise a plan which can ultimately bring income for a long period of time .
",
1335,0,," having oil does not just provide the money to undermine , or prevent democracy taking hold ; it also provides an immense source for corruption .
",
1336,0,," oil revenues provide a revenue stream that is not dependent on the people but simply upon the global market and oil production .
",
1337,0,," in a country with no checks and balances , accountability or transparency the money will inevitably go to the elite .
",
1338,0,," this is how equatorial guinea can be rich while having most of the population in poverty .
",
1339,0,," dictator obiang himself is worth an estimated $ 700million or the equivalent of about% of gdp .
",
1340,0,,"  a trust fund can ensure that money from oil goes to the poorest not the richest .
",
1341,0,," it is managed outside the country and away from political pressure .
",
1342,0,," if the government is corrupt and uses the national budget to its own ends the trust fund can provide the dividends as investment in individual development projects to ensure the money is used where it is most needed .
",
1343,0,," all the time it can be transparent to show when and where the government is trying to influence it or get backhanders .
",
1344,1,,"low unemployment is not only crucial for a functioning economy, but for a society.
",
1345,1,," after thefinancial crisis and start of the eurozone crisis in 2009, and subsequent worldwide sluggish economy, unemployment has become more of a problem in the european union.
",
1346,1,," concerns about debt and growth have discouraged investment, and in a number of states in the eu, such as portugal, ireland, greece and spain, caused states to require bailouts, often under the condition of the imposition of austerity measures.
",
1347,1,," austerity measures have meant public sector job losses in the countries concerned and even many countries that have not had austerity enforced by the size of their debt have been engaging in cutting back the public sector.
",
1348,1,," as a result, the seasonally adjusted employment rate in the eu as a whole (including both the countries who have been bailed out, and those bailing them out, such as germany and the netherlands) has increased from 7.5% in julyto 11% in july 2013.
",
1349,1,,"unemployment is not evenly spread across demographic groups, however.
",
1350,1,," according to eurostat, the group with the highest rate of unemployment is young people – 23.4% of under 25s were unemployed in 2013, compared to 7.6% in 2008.
",
1351,1,," this does not include people in education so almost a quarter of young people who finish school or university are finding that they cannot find a job.
",
1352,1,," youth unemployment not only causes problems to individuals, but broader social problems in the countries, in addition to the financial cost of social security, and the wasted potential.
",
1353,1,," the only long term solution to this is an economic recovery however this is something that is unlikely to happen quickly, even once the economy begins to recover it will be years before many countries reach full employment.
",
1354,1,," therefore, it has been proposed that a solution to youth unemployment is to guarantee young people a temporary job.
",
1355,1,,"this job could last for six months, which could be enough time to gain the skills which are needed to find further work and for the young people to show they can do a job.
",
1356,1,," government would fund this.
",
1357,1,," furthermore, government would fund training or preparation necessary for a person to do this.
",
1358,1,," however there would be limits to ensure it is not too expensive to train individuals.
",
1359,1,," the only requirement for private companies would be to create as many roles as needed.
",
1360,0,," the eu member states should rely more on public employment services , which should be focused on finding jobs for young people .
",
1361,0,," with government funding , they can work with the private sector to offer decent temporary jobs to young people .
",
1362,0,," this model is common in the nordic states and other countries , such as austria , germany and switzerland also have similar programs .
",
1363,0,," youth unemployment is already far higher than for older people .
",
1364,0,," less than a third of under 25s who were looking for a job infound one in-- this may be due to ageist discrimination against young people , and employers seeking people with experience .
",
1365,0,," people overare also considered as a high risk group .
",
1366,0,," they have little experience so the employer is taking a risk in employing them .
",
1367,0,," there is also a desire for stability ; those who already have a family are unlikely to want large changes so employers feel they can bet on them for the long term .
",
1368,0,," if the problem is a lack of experience then this proposal solves the problem .
",
1369,0,," giving younger people a temporary job and the experience that goes with it will help give everyone an equal chance at getting a job , irrespective of age .
",
1370,0,," therefore , the eu should step in and help provide jobs for younger people .
",
1371,0,," rising youth unemployment can be considered an international timebomb .
",
1372,0,," young people are the next generation of workers and consumers in the economy .
",
1373,0,," when they are unemployed , the situation can be alarming .
",
1374,0,," this is because of the importance of getting a job early on so as to avoid becoming long term unemployed .
",
1375,0,," the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has called for stronger policies involving young people .
",
1376,0,," the ilo has warned that youth unemployment can lead to apathy towards government and political instability .
",
1377,0,," the lack of experience in work may cause a lost generation .
",
1378,0,," this must be averted , and the eu is one of the best placed to do this .
",
1379,0,," the temporary work scheme would encourage business to change their attitude and hire more young workers .
",
1380,0,," having to hire young people , even for a short time , would help break negative stereotypes and often the employers would then offer longer term work .
",
1381,0,," this would help to fill the 2million unfilled vacancies that exist in the eu with young people .
",
1382,0,," while we often think of workplace diversity as being about having people from all over the world and both men and women a good age balance is necessary too .
",
1383,0,," by bringing in this policy , younger workers will be in the same workplaces as older employees , and vice versa , making for more workplace diverse .
",
1384,0,," employees will learn from those with more experience , in addition to the other advantages of a more diverse workforce .
",
1385,0,," one of these is more engagement and engaged workers perform% better and are less likely to leave .
",
1386,0,," another is that young people will contribute new and innovative ways of thinking , with different viewpoints pushing the business forward .
",
1387,0,," finally a company needs to have all ages in the business to ensure that there are people with experience when older workers retire .
",
1388,0,," diversity is also crucial for the appearance of a business .
",
1389,0,," the kind of company that attracts a broader pool of individuals means a greater range of talented candidates to choose from .
",
1390,0,," businesses who create more diverse workplaces perform better .
",
1391,0,," if the government is employing people then it is going to be boosting the economy .
",
1392,0,," providing a fiscal boost by spending money is one of the most accepted ways of boosting the economy .
",
1393,0,," in this case spending money on temporary workers is good in several ways .
",
1394,0,," first it is a fiscal boost to the economy .
",
1395,0,," the government will be paying the temporary workers .
",
1396,0,," these workers will have more money to spend and will probably mostly spend it rather than saving .
",
1397,0,," this in turn boosts demand for other goods and services so meaning there needs to be more output with the result that some jobs will be made permanent .
",
1398,0,," there is therefore a positive feedback loop .
",
1399,0,," the second way in which this helps the economy is that it is investment .
",
1400,0,," it is investment because the government is paying for young people to gain experience and for companies to be training these temporary workers .
",
1401,0,," the result of this is a more skilled workforce who in the long term will be more productive .
",
1402,0,," there is a final possible benefit .
",
1403,0,," with government paying for workers they are effectively subsidizing firms .
",
1404,0,," even if they are new trainees the young temporary workers will be providing output for companies at next to no cost .
",
1405,0,," this then makes that firm more competitive against its global competitors .
",
1406,1,,"in the middle of the 1990s the formerly nationalised british rail was privatised.
",
1407,1,," the resulting franchise system has regularly been criticised for increasing prices, delays and bad service, as well as for the amount of state money that still goes into the system.
",
1408,1,," one area where there has been undoubted success, although privatisation may have nothing to do with it, is in the increasing usage of the railways.
",
1409,1,," the number of passenger journeys has doubled from 735million in 1994/5 to 1.5billion in 2012/3.
",
1410,1,," this huge increase has taken any excess capacity britain’s rail system had and lead to increasing problems with overcrowding.
",
1411,1,,"the answer from the coalition government has been ‘high speed two’ (hs2), with high speedhaving been the link to the channel tunnel from london.
",
1412,1,," the commitment to creating a high speed rail network was in their coalition agreement that outlined some of the policies the parties could agree on; in this case it was a merger of liberal democrat demands for a greener country and conservative opposition to the expansion of heathrow airport.
",
1413,1,,"at the end of decemberthe government started consultations on the route from london to birmingham and then breaking in two with one branch to manchester and another to leeds.
",
1414,1,," the government gave the go ahead for the first phase of the network to birmingham on 10th january 2012.
",
1415,1,," the intention is that this phase would be complete byand the second phase would finish construction a few years later inhaving been started slightly later.
",
1416,1,," the price tag was set as being £32.7billion.
",
1417,1,,"since its launch however things have not been going well for hs2, it has faced hostility from residents along the route, questions about whether it will deliver its touted benefits and whether it is the best route, judicial reviews and inflating costs.
",
1418,1,," just as seriously for a long term infrastructure project the opposition labour party has been increasingly sceptical with the shadow chancellor ed balls at the labour party conference declaring “under this government the high speed two project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50bn… labour will not take this irresponsible approach… there will be no blank cheque from me as a labour chancellor for this project or for any project.”
",
1419,1,," with labour almost certain to be in power at some point beforethe government clearly needs some backing from the opposition if the business community is to buy in.
",
1420,1,,"the government has also been slowly revising down the forecasted benefits of the high speed line; in its most recent report the benefits were lowered from £2.50 to £2.30 for every pound spent on the project, and this comes only a few days after reports that there would be many places around the country that would actually lose out as a result of the new line.
",
1421,1,," many people are not even convinced by the revised benefits and argue the money could be better spent elsewhere, either upgrading the existing network or even on areas that have nothing to do with railways.
",
1422,0,," the uk has a north south divide in terms of wealth and income .
",
1423,0,," london and the south east has for the last few decades done much better than the north ; while industry and mining in the north has declined financial services in the south have boomed .
",
1424,0,," the result is inequality between regions .
",
1425,0,," high speed two will help to solve this inequality by increasing connections between north and south .
",
1426,0,," the government `` suggests that hs2 could provide a boost to the birmingham city region equivalent to between 2.1 % and 4.2 % of its gdp .
",
1427,0,," for the manchester city region the figure is 0.8 % -1.7 % , for the leeds city region 1.6 % '' .
",
1428,0,," this is because businesses will be more likely to invest there when there is better infrastructure , companies based in london in particular will be much more likely to see the benefits of investing in , or partnering with businesses in the north when they can easily reach those cities .
",
1429,0,," capacity on the railways is a big problem in the uk .
",
1430,0,," due to growth since privatisation britain 's railways take as many passengers as it is physically possible to do ; more than a fifth of rush hour passengers have to stand .
",
1431,0,," growth is almost certain to continue as the roads too are at capacity and population continues to rise .
",
1432,0,," the result is more railways are needed .
",
1433,0,," rail freight meanwhile if forecast to double by the 2040s .
",
1434,0,," the west coast main line is a particular bottleneck for freight with% of uk freight services using the line ; any increase would have to come at the expense of passenger services .
",
1435,0,," transferring the main rail services to the high speed line would free up the wcml to increased freight and commuter use so hs2 would not just mean an increase in long distance capacity .
",
1436,0,," the united kingdom has been somewhat of a laggard when it comes to high speed rail .
",
1437,0,," in the first half of the century britain 's railways were the fastest in the world , still holding the world speed record for steam .
",
1438,0,," but since what we would now consider to be high speed started with the launch of the shinkansen inthe uk has only marginally upgraded its own railways to 125mph .
",
1439,0,," this means the only high speed line the uk has is the link to the channel tunnel which does not serve a large number of internal passengers .
",
1440,0,," the uk therefore has 113km of high speed rail againstin germany ,in italy ,in france andin spain .
",
1441,0,," even much smaller countries such as the netherlands and belgium have longer high speed lines .
",
1442,0,," big infrastructure projects often provide a big boost to the economy .
",
1443,0,," hs2 will do this in two ways ; the first will be in the economic activity created in building the line and the estimatedjobs staffing the railway .
",
1444,0,," much more important however are the wider economic benefits .
",
1445,0,," on a cost-benefit basis hs2 is considered to be ` high value for money ' because it will have a 1:2.3 cost : benefit ratio .
",
1446,0,," this ration however could be considerably better if ridership keeps increasing for longer or faster than expected .
",
1447,0,," the overall benefit to the economy is estimated at #billion .
",
1448,0,," the most obvious benefit from high speed rail is that journey times will be less .
",
1449,0,," from london the journey to birmingham will be reduced fromtominutes , leeds fromtoand manchesterto.
",
1450,0,," while faster journeys provide some economic benefit the are as much a social benefit of making more places accessible by allowing individuals to spend less time traveling and more doing what they want to when they get there .
",
1451,1,,"in finance, a bond is an instrument of indebtedness where the issuer, in this case the government or the european union, is indebted to the holder (a form of loan).
",
1452,1,," the terms may vary but the issuer is obliged to pay the holder interest and/or to repay the holder at a later date, termed the maturity which can often be as long as thirty years.
",
1453,1,," interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly).
",
1454,1,," bonds provide the borrower with funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.
",
1455,1,,"the suggestion for european bonds (eurobonds) is that government bonds for the eurozone should be issued in euros jointly by theeurozone nations.
",
1456,1,," the holder is therefore giving money to the eurozone bloc altogether, which then forwards the money to individual governments, rather than each individual government issuing its own bonds.
",
1457,1,,"since the beginning of the crisis, countries tried to resolve the problem with the help of bailouts provided the european stability mechanism (esm) or its predecessors.
",
1458,1,," the esm is an international organization established onseptemberthat will cover any new bailouts it will ensure that member governments have access to money by providing instant access to financial assistance for member states in financial difficulty.
",
1459,1,," it has a maximum lending capacity of €500 billion.
",
1460,1,," this however is regarded by many simply as a stopgap to cover any new crises rather than a long term solution.
",
1461,1,,"in the status quo, sovereign-bonds are issued by national governments with an interest rate that is different from country to country, making them affordable for countries like germany or the netherlands but extremely expensive for greece, spain, italy and others.
",
1462,1,," for example greece has an interest rate of 8.47% on its yields, while germany is at 1.86%.
",
1463,1,," eurobonds will still be issued by national governments with full responsibility for the loan but they will have to be backed by the european central bank (ecb) and will be listed on the market as one product, with a singular interest rate.
",
1464,0,," one of the most important european union principles is solidarity and mutual respect among european citizens and this can only be achieved by more integration and stronger connections between states .
",
1465,0,," the economic crisis has clearly shown that more integration is necessary if europe is to prevent suffering and economic hardship .
",
1466,0,," from the economic perspective , unemployment rates reached disastrous levels inwith greece at 24,3 % and spain% .
",
1467,0,," there is a lack of leadership and connection between countries in the european union that is not allowing them to help one-another and solve the economic crisis .
",
1468,0,," from the political point of view the result of this is that extremist parties are on the rise with the best example of golden dawn in greece .
",
1469,0,," while inandthe party did n't win any seats in the greek parliament , after the crisis hit in junethey wonseats .
",
1470,0,," in time of distress , the logical solution is not that every country should fight for itself but rather the willingness to invest and integrate more in the union to provide a solution for all .
",
1471,0,," eurobonds provides the integration that will help prevent these problems , it will both halt the current crisis of government debts because governments will have lower interest repayments and not have the threat of default , and it will show solidarity between members .
",
1472,0,," this in turn will help any future integration as showing that europe cares for those in difficulty will make everyone more willing to invest in the project .
",
1473,0,," introducing eurobonds will lower interest rates for bonds issued by national governments so making the loans affordable .
",
1474,0,," the most recent example of this problem is the need of recapitalization of banks in cyprus .
",
1475,0,," although government debt and interest rates were not the direct problem if the government had been able to borrow at low interest rates to recapitalize its own banks then it would have not needed a bailout from the rest of the eurozone .
",
1476,0,," in order to avoid these kinds of solutions and put people back to work in countries like portugal , italy or spain , national governments need a bigger demand for their bonds so that interest rates go down .
",
1477,0,," right now , sovereign-bonds are not affordable for the government as their interest rates are extremely high .
",
1478,0,," greece has an interest rate of 9.01 % , portugal 6.23 % , and italy and spain near 4.30 % .
",
1479,0,," if we choose to bundle the bonds together we will obtain a single interest rate that will lower the price of bonds and permit countries to borrow more , the price would be closer to germany 's than greece 's as the eurozone as a whole is not more risky than other big economies .
",
1480,0,," more than that , the markets wo n't be worry anymore of the possible default of countries like greece ; as the bonds are backed up by the ecb and indirectly by other countries in the union , the debtors will know that their loans will be repaid because in the last resort more financially solvent countries take on the burden .
",
1481,0,," when the risk of default is eliminated , the demand for government bonds will rise and the interest rates will go down .
",
1482,0,," it is estimated that italy could save up to% of its gdp and portugal would see annual repayments fall by 15bn euros , or% of its gdp .
",
1483,0,," the european union should not only focus on the present but also try to find a permanent solution in resolving and preventing economic crisis .
",
1484,0,," the solution that is implemented right now through the european stability mechanism is a temporary one and has no power in preventing further crisis .
",
1485,0,," first of all , the failure of the european union to agree on banks bailout is a good example .
",
1486,0,," as economic affairs commissioner olli rehn admitted the bailout negotiations have been `` a long and difficult process '' because of the many institutions and ministers that have a say in making the decision .
",
1487,0,," more than that , it sometimes takes weeks and even months until germany and other leaders in the union can convince national parliaments to give money in order for us to be able to help those in need .
",
1488,0,," issuing bonds as a union of countries will provide more control to the ecb that will be able to approve or deny a loan -- one option would be that after a certain limit countries would have to borrow on their own .
",
1489,0,," this will prevent countries from borrowing and spending irrationally like greece , portugal , spain and italy did in the past .
",
1490,0,," the unsustainable economic approach can be easily seen in the fact that public sector wages in greece rose% betweenand- far faster than in most other eurozone countries .
",
1491,0,," clearly greece could make the choice to go separately to the market to fund this kind of spending but it would be unlikely to do so .
",
1492,1,,"in most developed countries, people who are unable to find work are given ""benefits"" or ""welfare"" money to support them whilst they are out of work.
",
1493,1,," traditionally, people are not required to do any work in return for this money.
",
1494,1,,"in the us, ""work-fare"" was developed as an alternative to this.
",
1495,1,," under workfare models, welfare recipients are obliged to perform some work or undergo training in exchange for their welfare payments.
",
1496,1,," there is generally a period of grace at the start of a term of unemployment, during which such work is not obligatory.
",
1497,1,," advocates argue that the model prevents the dependency culture that serves to lengthen unemployment and simultaneously provides skills to give welfare recipients a better chance of returning to work.
",
1498,0,," critics however maintain that workfare schemes are harmful to participants and do little to help them find jobs and get off welfare.
",
1499,0,,"making the unemployed work for their welfare benefits calls the bluff of those claiming benefit but not really looking for jobs .
",
1500,0,," such scroungers include the incurably lazy , those who are defrauding the taxpayer by claiming welfare while holding down a paying job , and those who are working in the black economy .
",
1501,0,," furthermore , workfare schemes require applicants also search for work whilst completing the scheme1 .
",
1502,0,," moving from a traditional something-for-nothing welfare scheme to a workfare system stops all these individuals from being a burden on the state , cutting welfare rolls very rapidly and allowing the government to concentrate upon assisting the truly needy .
",
1503,0,," society also benefits from the work done by those on workfare schemes : these might include environmental improvement in local communities , service to assist the elderly and disabled , and work for charities or local authorities .
",
1504,0,," in many cases the labour they provide would not have been available in any other way , so the addition they make to everyone 's quality of life is a welcome bonus to the scheme .
",
1505,0,," furthermore , astudy in denmark found a ` strong and significant crime reducing effect of the workfare policy . '
",
1506,0,," making the unemployed work for their welfare money positively breaks the dependency culture .
",
1507,0,," receiving unemployment benefit for doing nothing makes individuals too reliant on the state and encourages apathy and laziness ; this is particularly true of the long-term unemployed and of those who have never had a paying job since leaving school .
",
1508,0,," as president clinton said regarding welfare reform , ` the goal is to break the culture of poverty and dependence ' .
",
1509,0,," tying welfare money to productive work challenges these something-for-nothing assumptions and shows that the state has a right to ask for something in return for the generosity of its taxpayers .
",
1510,0,," in new york , workfare pays slightly less than the minimum wage , preserving the incentive for the unemployed to use workfare as a stepping stone into a better-paid , long-term job1 .
",
1511,1,,"the advent of computing has allowed governments, businesses and individuals to store, collate, analyse, and utilize huge amounts of data.
",
1512,1,," firms have made use of this power to store the personal data of their customers in order to better understand them and to cater to their needs.
",
1513,1,," others have even used the data online to offer targeted marketing aimed at the personal profiles of individuals, often created by way of information gleaned from cookies, search histories, etc. that give them a window on the sorts of people using their services.
",
1514,1,," sometimes even phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses are sold in this way.
",
1515,1,," databrokers such as choicepoint and acxiom purchase data from many sources, including government agencies, businesses, credit bureaus and investigators.
",
1516,1,," they then offer “analytical services” on millions of households.
",
1517,1,," this collation and utilization of data has spawned a secondary market in which firms have sold on their compiled data on individuals to other companies seeking to better understand the marketplace and to find consumers for their products.
",
1518,1,," it is a booming $300 billion-a-year industry.
",
1519,1,,"this vast increase in the dissemination and use of individuals’ private data has resulted in extensive debates across the world, and has spawned many laws, that mandate privacy controls and strict regulation of how this information is used.
",
1520,1,," however as the gathering and use of data rapidly changes the law often struggles to keep up.
",
1521,1,," the european union for example is in the process of reforming its data protection rules that it implemented in 1995.
",
1522,1,," the debate is a serious one, because at its heart is the question of what information people use in their commercial dealings should be accessible permanently by firms and which can actually be distributed to someone willing to pay for.
",
1523,1,," for those who wish to prevent companies from collecting this information this represents a serious violation of privacy and runs the risk of data being misused by firms, and misappropriated by even less savoury institutions, such as hackers.
",
1524,1,," their opponents, particularly business, on the other hand contend that the efficiency and targeting gains generated by this information-gathering has allowed firms to offer more and better services to consumers, enriching their lives.
",
1525,1,,"the following debate addresses all these issues, focusing on the ethics of the data storage and whether in fact it can lead to meaningfully better outcomes both for consumers and companies.
",
1526,0,," the gathering of personal data that companies undertake is done in a fashion that is fundamentally invasive of individuals ' privacy .
",
1527,0,," when individuals go online they act as private parties , often enjoying anonymity in their personal activities .
",
1528,0,," companies , particular online services , collate information and seek to use it to market products and services that are specifically tailored to those individuals .
",
1529,0,," in the context of the internet , this means that individuals ' activities online are in fact susceptible to someone else 's interference and oversight , stealing from them the privacy and security the internet has striven to provide since its inception .
",
1530,0,," at the most basic level , the invasion of privacy that collating and using private data gleaned from customers is unacceptable .
",
1531,0,," there is a very real risk of the information being misused , as the data can be held , and even resold to third parties that the customers never consented to giving their data and might well not want to come into possession of their personal details .
",
1532,0,," this can lead to serious abuses of individuals ' private information by corporations , or indeed other agents that might have less savoury uses for the information , most obviously the more places your personal information is the more likely it is to be lost in a data breach with 267million records exposed in.
",
1533,0,," even when the information is not exposed it may be used in ways that have a real impact on the individual such as determining credit scores .
",
1534,0,," people as a matter of principle should have control over who gets access to their private information .
",
1535,0,," giving companies that are driven by profit motive to sell on their customers ' data to anyone that might offer a suitable price stands as an absolute theft of personal information and privacy .
",
1536,0,," people experiencing the use of their personal details by companies have largely been found to see the process as extremely invasive and unsettling .
",
1537,0,," many have felt violated by the exploitation of their personal lives to market them products , often from people to whom they never consented to hand over information .
",
1538,0,," this feeling has been demonstrated through significant public outcry and backlash , as well as empirical results showing these attitudes becoming more and more widespread , particularly in the case of online targeted advertising , which is the most well-known use of personal information .
",
1539,0,," the best example of such backlash is the result of amazon.com 's `` dynamic pricing '' system , in which the company varied its offerings and pricings to customers based on information gathered about them from prior uses .
",
1540,0,," the result was a severe backlash that cost amazon business until it ended the policy .
",
1541,0,," this has led to a blunting of the desired outcome of such marketers who experience declines in uptake rather than increased and more efficient reach of marketing .
",
1542,0,," furthermore , the targeted marketing that arises from these forms of information storage and sale can tend toward stereotypes , using programmes that favour broad brushstrokes in their marketing , resulting in stereotyped services on the basis of apparent race and gender .
",
1543,0,," when this happens it is all the more alienating .
",
1544,0,," the data collected and sold by companies is not safe .
",
1545,0,," servers with even the most sophisticated security systems are susceptible to hackers and other miscreants seeking to exploit the personal data of unsuspecting customers .
",
1546,0,," identity theft is a ubiquitous threat in the information age , one that increases every year as the arms race between data protection designers and invaders rages on .
",
1547,0,," data breaches have been rapidly increasing and although the total number declined frommillion exposed records intomillion inthis has increasingly been due to hacking rather than simple negligence .
",
1548,0,," the result of these breaches is huge costs to individuals who have their identities and also to firms that appear to be unsafe .
",
1549,0,," as individuals see companies as being uncaring of their information they tend to punish them in the market .
",
1550,0,," there is no opt-in because the individual has no means of seeing to whom the data is sold , and how secure their servers might be , putting them doubly at risk .
",
1551,0,," firms are better off not playing with fire and keeping data that could have huge potential costs to them if it is lost , and individuals are better off not having their information disseminated across cyberspace without any guarantee of its safety .
",
1552,1,,"the republican party has traditionally been thought of as the party of the economy, leaving more ‘social’ goals to the democrats in the public’s mind.
",
1553,1,," it is interesting to consider whether this remains the case in the post-bush era.
",
1554,1,," equally, it is interesting to consider where the republican economic message would come from at a time when their old mantra of ‘deregulate or die’ has been tarnished by the banking crisis.
",
1555,0,," republican presidencies have been marked by higher unemployment , bigger deficits and lower wages .
",
1556,0,," the congressional republican response to thecrash was to pass a bill that curtailedenvironmental regulations , blaming the epa for the stalled economy .
",
1557,0,," why is anyone 's guess .
",
1558,1,,"in the wake of the banking crisis of 2008, significant press coverage was given to the large salaries, bonuses and pensions being paid to certain individuals in banking and finance, which were seen as being excessively high in relation to both the social worth of those jobs, and to what salary is needed to live a reasonably comfortable life.
",
1559,1,," this echoed common media narratives surrounding the excessive pay of groups such as footballers, lawyers, actors, and singers, especially as compared to jobs that are commonly accepted as having significant social worth, such as nurses and teachers.
",
1560,1,,"this requires some clear definitions; a broad definition of salary should be taken (to include pensions, stock options, bonuses etc.) to ensure that a salary cap could not in practice be avoided.
",
1561,1,," furthermore, it should be clear if entrepreneur's 'salary' (i.e. profits from their companies) should be included; it is suggested that it is included, to ensure proposition's arguments on levels of equality are principally consistent.
",
1562,0,," finally, the debate is helped if a figure is placed on the maximum salary; the arguments below are not harmed by establishing a maximum salary of $150,000 (with a possibly allowance for a bonus of up to $30,000).
",
1563,0,,"this system would be best implemented by imposing a mandatory% tax on all personal income over $ 150,000 , and all bonuses over $ 30,000 .
",
1564,0,," this means that some revenue could still be raised from this if people did continue to pay large salaries and bonuses , although they are unlikely to do so .
",
1565,0,," furthermore , it would be best implemented through international cooperation , to limit the opportunity of one country to be able to offer higher salaries and poach talented individuals .
",
1566,0,," countries may agree to this as it prevents a ` race to the top ' in salaries , where companies have to offer more and more money to attract the best people .
",
1567,0,," as a result of having to pay important directors and employees a lower wage , businesses will be able to produce their goods and services for a lower cost , and sell therefore sell them for a lower price .
",
1568,0,," this will lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth , as the poorest will become relatively richer , as prices will fall .
",
1569,0,," this will also be true for small businesses , which will be able to obtain cheaper legal and financial advice and business consultancy , and are therefore more likely to succeed .
",
1570,0,," sports provide a good example of this .
",
1571,0,," in major league baseball salaries for the players more than doubled in real terms betweenandwhile ticket prices rose% .
",
1572,0,," as players wages take more than% of teams revenues a cap would mean a significant cut in costs that could be passed on to the consumer .1 when wages are better standardized across professions , people are less likely to feel socially pressured into seeking out a higher paid job .
",
1573,0,," as such , they are more likely to choose their job on the basis of other factors , such as how much they enjoy the job , or how ethical the working practices of a company are .
",
1574,0,," this will lead to happier , and hence more productive , employees .
",
1575,0,," some resources -- most notably housing -- are very important to large numbers of people , and owning them gives people a great deal of happiness .
",
1576,0,," this policy will limit richer people owning several properties while others live in rented accommodation or smaller houses , as price competition for such properties will be less intense , and poorer people will be better able to compete through savings .
",
1577,0,," estimates insuggested there were 6.8 million second homes in the usa1.
",
1578,0,,"this is a good thing , as it is likely that a person , or family , values their first property more than another person values their second property , known as the law of diminishing marginal returns .
",
1579,0,," this is perhaps the best example of the ways in which inequality leads to worse outcomes for society .
",
1580,0,," firstly , it limits social tension that may arise due to public dissatisfaction with high wages ; see the attacks on the famous banker sir fred goodwin in the uk1 .
",
1581,0,," secondly , people may feel that society recognizes them as being more equal , increasing the perceived self-worth of many , avoiding feelings of inferiority and worry about their social worth , and making them feel closer to other people .
",
1582,0,," see , for example , sweden , which has the lowest gini coefficient , indicating low levels of inequality , in the world , and also some of the highest levels of gdp per capita , life expectancy and literacy rates , and low levels of crime and obesity2 .
",
1583,0,," furthermore , a forbes report suggests sweden is one of the happiest countries in the world , along with denmark , finland and norway ,other countries with a low gini coefficient ,.
",
1584,1,,"the idea of a government intervening to preserve a free press may sound anathema at first glance but, in reality, it’s actually fairly common.
",
1585,1,," in recent years the decline in advertising revenue and plummeting levels of subscription – both as a result of the internet – have served as hammer blows to the traditional media.
",
1586,1,,"however, the decline has been going on far longer than that.
",
1587,1,," the increased concentration of titles in the hands of a few moguls has tended, with a few honorable exceptions, to mean hemorrhaging jobs with fewer journalists writing more stories.
",
1588,1,," there is little doubt that quality has been on the decline for decades and the advent of the internet and omnipresent pr have hastened the demise.
",
1589,1,,"taking the watergate scandal as an example, it would be unlikely that such a story would be produced now; there simply wouldn’t be the time; allowing two journalists to take months to pursue a fairly unlikely lead is simply a luxury most papers can’t afford.
",
1590,1,,"however, this misses the point in many ways because it ignores where most journalism takes place.
",
1591,1,," the great national papers of inquiry or record will no doubt survive in one form or another, although most now see their websites as their primary focus with the print edition being treated as a legacy product.
",
1592,1,," the place where the blow is hardest is at the level of local publishing and trade publishing.
",
1593,1,," both forms are the embodiment of the idea that something can be small but perfectly formed.
",
1594,1,," local or city papers’ advertising revenue was generated not so much on the basis of the size of their circulation but on its precision.
",
1595,1,," the springfield news leader may only sell in springfield, but everyone in springfield reads it.
",
1596,1,,"this very precise circulation made for a powerful advertising tool for local businesses.
",
1597,1,," in turn it generated enough revenue to do some real reporting.
",
1598,1,," local journalism is also the level where the vast bulk of the great correspondents of the future learned their craft.
",
1599,1,," the same cannot be said of the specialist trade press.
",
1600,1,,"there have been many different models proposed of how such subsidies might be undertaken, ranging from direct cash grants based on circulation, to subsidized postal costs, to magazines to giving citizens a bursary to spend on their own media choices.
",
1601,1,," the exact method is really not as interesting as the general principle which will remain the focus of this debate.
",
1602,0,," a great deal of modern journalism has become a fairly disreputable commentary on whichever celebrity non-event happens to be in vogue at the moment .
",
1603,0,," quite rightly nobody would really miss this if it vanished tomorrow .
",
1604,0,," however , journalism at its best remains one of the strongest defenses against tyranny , corruption and hypocrisy in public life that there is .
",
1605,0,," the state already invests large amounts of money into the media , both directly and indirectly .
",
1606,0,," firstly the state directly funds organisations like pbs and indirectly funds the likes of the bbc .
",
1607,0,," in addition all governments are major media buyers in their own right , responsible for huge amounts of advertising and this applies to local government more than the national government .
",
1608,0,," in addition there are softer subsidies such as government funding for journalism courses at universities .
",
1609,1,,"on saturday 5th may the french and greeks went to the polls and both countries voted against austerity.
",
1610,1,," in france president sarkozy became the 11th european leader to loose office largely as a result of the european financial crisis being replaced by francois hollande, a socialist, who campaigned on a promise of growth and less austerity.
",
1611,1,,"the european economy is in crisis, the economies of many member states have been flat lining or even declining since the financial crisis of 2008.
",
1612,1,," the smaller countries around europe’s periphery in particular have faced steep declines in their economies.
",
1613,1,," ireland’s economy declined by 6.7% betweenandwhile greece’s has fallen by 16%.
",
1614,1,," what started as a financial crisis or a housing bubble has become a debt crisis as governments tried to spend their way out of recession they built up large debts, so large in the case of some countries that they have had to have bail outs.
",
1615,1,," other european countries only agreed to provide money for these bail outs on the condition of the countries being rescued impose austerity to reduce their expenditures to provide confidence that they will be able to pay back their debts.
",
1616,1,," on 2nd marcheuropean leaders with the exception of the uk and czech republic signed the fiscal compact which committed its signatories to a structural deficit (meaning it allows for deficits for investments like infrastructure that will pay off in the future) not exceeding 0.5% of gdp and to reducing government debt down to 60% of gdp.
",
1617,1,," austerity however is not popular and the results of the recent elections are threatening this treaty and its ambitious goals.
",
1618,1,," this discusses whether europe needs to stick to stringent austerity measures such as those that will be needed to meet the compact or should states put the social support of their citizens first.
",
1619,1,,"some terms used in this debateausterity: during the recent crisis has come to mean an economic policy of cutting the deficit and debt through cutting spending.
",
1620,1,," this often inevitably means reducing benefits.
",
1621,1,,"demand: the amount people are willing to buy of goods and services at a given price.
",
1622,1,," in the whole economy this means the combined amount of goods and services the whole population wants to buy.
",
1623,1,,"social support: in this debate we are taking this to mean support provided by the state to society and individuals.
",
1624,1,,"welfare state: the responsibility of the state for the social and economic wellbeing of its citizens usually in the case of health care, education, employment and social security.
",
1625,0,," we all have a duty to provide aid to those who need it and the government is the best placed to act on this duty .
",
1626,0,," we all need a place to live , a level of healthcare and some income in order to survive .
",
1627,0,," the idea behind the welfare state is to provide for this through creating a safety net for every citizen .
",
1628,0,," the state is responsible for the social and economic wellbeing of it citizens .
",
1629,0,," it does this by , for example , provision of social housing -- either at greatly reduced rates or free of charge , through state hospitals , through unemployment benefit for those made unemployed and disability benefits for those who ca n't work .
",
1630,0,," with austerity the government is doing exactly the opposite of what it should be doing to help its citizens .
",
1631,0,," just at a time when more people need these payments they are being cut back .
",
1632,0,," to make matters worse an increase in vat has been a favored method of increasing government income while there has been a squeeze on unemployment benefits as the government does not want to pay more as unemployment rises ; in greece in the year to decemberthe number of unemployed workers was up 45.1 % whereas the number of unemployment benefit recipients went up only 9.6 % .
",
1633,0,," as a result the whole package of austerity measures is usually regressive , with its impact falling harder on the poor than the rich , as has been the case in greece .
",
1634,0,," austerity leads to a cycle of decline that continues on down until the state has been stripped down to the bare bones .
",
1635,0,," we are seeing this in countries where the european union has enforced austerity as a condition for bailouts , particularly greece .
",
1636,0,," government austerity reduces demand as the government is spending less .
",
1637,0,," with less demand the economy is damaged and a smaller tax take comes in for the government leading to even greater austerity if the government is to balance its books .
",
1638,0,," austerity therefore creates a vicious cycle when there is no extra demand from the private sector to cushion the blow .
",
1639,0,," even standard & poor 's previously a champion of austerity in its justification for downgrading the credit rating of eurozone governments said `` austerity alone risks becoming self-defeating , as domestic demand falls in line with consumers ' rising concerns about job security and disposable incomes , eroding national tax revenues . ''
",
1640,0,," the answer is therefore less austerity , more support for the economy and more social support for the citizens .
",
1641,0,," if people are less concerned for the future as a result of knowing there will be government support if they are made unemployed they will be more willing to spend rather than save when they are employed so helping the economy to recover .
",
1642,0,," recessions are caused by too little demand in the economy so austerity in a time of recession is exactly the opposite of what the government should be doing as it means further reductions in the amount of demand in the economy .
",
1643,0,," governments should take an activist approach to try to stabilise the economic cycle , the swinging from boom to bust to boom that characterises the economy , or at least reduce the depths of the recessions and temper the booms .
",
1644,0,," this means that governments should spend less when the economy is booming and , crucially , more when the economy is in recession so as to stabilise the economy .
",
1645,0,," it should be remembered that government spending does not just affect the public sector there is a multiplier effect on the economy , spending on building a road not only means construction companies get business but so do their suppliers and their workers spend their new wages in shops .
",
1646,0,," economists working for president obama at the time of the u.s. stimulus believed that for every$ spent by the government there would be 1.6 $ benefit to the economy .
",
1647,0,," the current course of austerity on top of austerity risks creating a lost generation of youth across europe .
",
1648,0,," unemployment is high everywhere in europe but it is particularly pronounced among young people .
",
1649,0,," in the eurozone the average youth , under 25s , unemployment rate is 21.6 % while in spain and greece it is more than% .
",
1650,0,," such staggeringly high unemployment rates will have immense consequences as a whole generation is demoralised .
",
1651,0,," even when the economy recovers this lost generation may not be able to get a job as new school leavers and graduates will get the jobs in preference to those who have been unemployed for long periods .
",
1652,0,," there needs to be more money , not less , for education and retraining for the sectors of the economy where there are jobs , such as it specialists .
",
1653,0,," this means more investment not just in adult education but more money being spent on creating jobs , whether permanent , placements or internships , specifically to give young people experience in work .
",
1654,0,," the european commission recognises the problem and is providing $million for placements around europe , member governments must do the same .
",
1655,1,,"urbanisation is what once formed civilisation.
",
1656,1,," when we as a species transitioned from living in small communities that were dedicated to farming and small scale production to cities in which large amounts of people were gathered to produce and to consume, the stage was set, first for the renaissance and later for the industrial revolution.
",
1657,1,," in today’s society, urbanisation is still the trend, inthe world for the first time had more than half of the world’s population lived in towns and cities and this is projected to increase to 60% by 2030.
",
1658,1,," while international migration often exercises national politics internal migration is much larger in terms of total numbers; while there were 190million international migrants in 2005, china alone had around the same number of internal migrants.
",
1659,1,," however, with increased mobility and a smaller need for manual labour, it is been put into doubt whether the cities can handle the vast amounts of people who enter on a daily basis.
",
1660,1,," this is particularly problematic in developing nations where any city already has innate problems which might be exacerbated by the influx of more people.
",
1661,1,," in major cities, such as nairobi and johannesburg, large townships have appeared, often as large in themselves as major european cities, where poor people lead a parallel existence, separated from the urban community.
",
1662,1,," attempts have been made, in particular in china, to impose policies that keep people in the rural communities from moving into the cities, in order to stem the flow of domestic migration.
",
1663,1,," china’s hukou system is one of china’s major social controls with the aim of directly regulating population distribution.
",
1664,1,," it links chinese citizens access to state benefits, and sometimes jobs, to the individual staying where they are registered.
",
1665,1,," this does not prevent rural to urban migration, as it is possible to change status, but it does attempt to control migration.
",
1666,1,,"in this debate the government would make it illegal for people in the countryside to move into the cities without first receiving permission from the authorities.
",
1667,1,," failing to recognise the ban would lead to deportation to the community from whence the individual came and possibly other sanctions.
",
1668,1,," this could be done through border controls or more probably by linking each individual’s identity to their community, by means of passports or social identity numbers, to make it impossible to live a functional life in the city without permission.
",
1669,0,," man is a social being .
",
1670,0,," therefore people live in communities where decisions that affect the many , are taken by representatives of the many .
",
1671,0,," thus , a social contract exists between the people and their government .
",
1672,0,," in exchange for part of their autonomy and freedom , the government ensures that policies are made in the best interest of people , even if this might come at the expense of short-term interests for some individuals .
",
1673,0,," this is a typical example of this kind of case .
",
1674,0,," the trend is emptying the countryside , stopping the production of agricultural goods and hollowing the amenities provided by the cities .
",
1675,0,," even if each individual has a personal incentive to move to the cities , the harm to the cities is greater than their accumulated individual gains .
",
1676,0,," it is in these cases that the state must act to protect its people and ensure long term benefits .
",
1677,0,," cities are very appealing to poor people .
",
1678,0,," even if their living standards in cities might be unacceptable , they get closer to basic goods , such as fresh water , sanitation etc, however , these things exist because there are productive people in the cities who work and pay taxes .
",
1679,0,," what happens when too many people come at the same time is that public money is stretched too thinly and these basic goods can no longer be provided .
",
1680,0,," this leads to severe humanitarian problems such as malnutrition , thirst , lack of medication , etc, however , this humanitarian crisis does not only harm those directly affected , it also creates an unattractive environment for business .
",
1681,0,," thus , people who enter the city can not find work , as production does not grow in relation to the people who enter .
",
1682,0,," they become excluded from society and often turn to crime , which further erodes the economy .
",
1683,0,," limiting migration to reasonable levels give the cities a chance to develop progressively and become the kind of places that people in rural areas currently believe them to be .
",
1684,0,," unlimited rural-urban migration erodes the economy of the cities , as shown in the previous argument , and limits their economic growth and available resources .
",
1685,0,," on a national level , this causes decision makers to prioritise the cities , as the country relies more on urban than rural areas , thus preventing them from investing in the country-side .
",
1686,0,," china is a good example of this where urban privilege has become entrenched with ` special economic zones ' being created in urban areas , though sometimes built from scratch in rural areas , with money being poured into infrastructure for the urban areas which as a result have rapidly modernised leaving rural areas behind .
",
1687,0,," this leads to a whole culture of divisions where urbanites consider those from rural areas to be backward and less civilized .
",
1688,0,," moreover , there will be little other reason to invest in rural areas , as the workforce in those areas has left for the cities .
",
1689,0,," by preserving resources in the cities and keeping the workforce in the rural areas , it becomes possible to invest in rural communities and change their lives for the better as these areas maintain the balanced workforce necessary to attract investors .
",
1690,0,," the cause of rural-urban migration in developing nations and the main reason why it becomes problematic is that people who move to the cities are not making informed decisions .
",
1691,0,," they are led to believe that the cities contain opportunities that they can not find where they live , and there are no mechanisms such as efficient media or adequate education to eradicate this misconception .
",
1692,0,," myths can be easily propagated by a single successful migrant returning home to visit that then attracts many others to try their luck without any knowledge of the possible costs .
",
1693,0,," this is exacerbated by unscrupulous organisations that prey on their desperation to take all their money to organise their move to the city .
",
1694,0,," some of those who are trafficked find themselves brought to the city and exploited through forced labour , begging , or even prostitution .
",
1695,0,," many of those who move to cities find themselves in a worse situation but have lost any moving power they originally had and are thus trapped .
",
1696,1,,"for the last forty years the european union has been pursuing a large scale social project involving the integration and harmonisation of the bureaucracies and economic, social and foreign policies of europe’s sovereign states.
",
1697,1,," the eu’s predecessor, the european coal and steel union was created to control economic competition between france and germany.
",
1698,1,,"attempts to control the market for coal and steel, by manipulating prices and driving up rates of production had traditionally been a flashpoint for conflict between france and germany.
",
1699,1,," it was believed that by placing the coal and steel industries of both nations under the control of an impartial, supranational body, conflict of this type could be avoided.
",
1700,1,," the coal and steel community would ensure that both nations could use their raw materials reserves to fuel economic growth and development, rather than arms manufacturing and warfare.
",
1701,1,," an independent court was set up to adjudicate in disputes (primarily to do with economic and export policy) between the community’s states.
",
1702,1,,"the adoption of the euro was intended to move this process of integration closer to completion.
",
1703,1,," it was argued that if the eu were to adopt a single currency, with a fixed exchange rate, movement of capital and labour through the eu’s economy would be made more efficient.
",
1704,1,," fluctuations in the value of individual currencies, and the difficulties inherent in converting reserves of one currency into another would be removed.
",
1705,1,," it would also reduce some of the risk inherent in investing in foreign states.
",
1706,1,," investing money in a state that operates its own currency exposes lenders to the possibility that economic turmoil in the state may cause the value of the currency to collapse, the value of its imports to rise or the value of its exports to fall.
",
1707,1,," however, if the state is part of a currency union, with the value of its scrip controlled centrally and dependent on the economic performance of a wide range of industries within a plurality of states, an isolated economic crisis is not likely to cause the currency to devalue.
",
1708,1,,"free movement of goods, labour, capital and services have improved the quality of life within eu member states immeasurably.
",
1709,1,," moreover, the creation of bodies such as the european court of justice and centrally coordinated national competition watchdogs has done much to foster dialog and reduce economic conflict within europe.
",
1710,1,," the rights of individual eu citizens have been enhanced by the creation of harmonised anti-discrimination and equal pay laws.
",
1711,1,," all of these advances stand to be lost if europe does not resolve the political differences that have made the euro such a contentious issue and such a difficult-to-manage currency.
",
1712,1,,"while the overall aim of “an ever closer union” between european states is laudable, many commentators believe that unification of the currencies of many of the eu’s members was a mistake.
",
1713,1,," ultimately, currency unions fail because of entrenched and unresolved economic and political differences between the states that sign up to them.
",
1714,1,," the political and economic cultures of europe are still so diverse that an effective union of european currencies- that is, the eurozone- has always been perceived as controversial.
",
1715,1,," following the adoption of the euro by the “eurozone” states, control over the currency’s value and supply, along with interest rates for overnight lending to european banks was handed over to a central body, the european central bank.
",
1716,1,," eurozone states lost the ability to set and control central bank interest rates within their borders.
",
1717,1,," now that the relatively high value of the euro is preventing weaker european economies from stimulating demand for their export products, many economists are arguing the eurozone members should be free to pursue different approaches to fostering stability and productivity at different times.
",
1718,1,,"several of the key terms that will be used in this debate require further definition.
",
1719,1,,"monetary policy describes the measures taken to control a state’s economy by altering the supply of money available to banks, businesses and individuals.
",
1720,1,," monetary policy may attempt to suppress inflation by altering the interest rate at which banks borrow money from the state.
",
1721,1,," the state may attempt to enhance its competitiveness within export markets by creating fresh quantities of currency, reducing the overall value of that currency.
",
1722,1,,"eurozone members have effectively surrendered control over their monetary policy by adopting the euro.
",
1723,1,," the european central bank has responsibility for determining the interest rates and quantitative supply of the euro.
",
1724,1,," individual members of the euro cannot determine its interest rate within their own borders.
",
1725,1,," they cannot suppress the value of euros that they hold.
",
1726,1,,"fiscal policy describes actions taken by a government with the objective of directly stimulating a state’s economy.
",
1727,1,," by contrast, monetary policy alters the supply of cash within an economy in order to alter the behaviour of economic actors, creating economic stability indirectly.
",
1728,1,," fiscal policy requires a government to involve itself intimately with an economy.
",
1729,1,," a government will either take money directly from its citizens, in the form of taxation, or will spend money that it is holding in reserve.
",
1730,1,," government expenditure will usually take the form of public works projects, increased healthcare and education funding, domestic stimulus packages (such as the car replacement schemes run by the uk and us government during 2008-2009) and investment in business.
",
1731,1,,"eurozone members retain control over their fiscal policy because, subject to the limitations imposed by membership of the eu, they still have authority to set taxation rates within their own borders, and to decide how much of the government’s budget will be spent on education, social welfare and investment.
",
1732,1,,"many eurozone states have neglected the revenue generating aspects of fiscal policy.
",
1733,1,," financial problems encountered by nations such as greece have been exacerbated by low tax rates and inefficient methods of tax collection.
",
1734,1,,"austerity is primarily used to decrease a state’s budget deficit and to provide it with more revenue with which to service other debts.
",
1735,1,," reductions in public services and reductions in individuals’ incomes caused by tax rises often result in significant social unrest.
",
1736,1,,"austerity may also involve liberalisation of state’s economy.
",
1737,1,," national industries may be privatised and collective bargaining mechanisms (such as unions) may be dismantled.
",
1738,0,," monetary policy and fiscal policy must be used in tandem if they are to be effective .
",
1739,0,," moreover , monetary policy and fiscal policy are tools that should only be wielded by politicians and bankers with an in-depth understanding of the economy that they are attempting to control .
",
1740,0,," the core problem with the eurozone is the belief that the business cycles of its various member states are so closely aligned that they can all be controlled by the same body .
",
1741,0,," unfortunately , this premise contradicts one of the most beneficial effects of the european single market -- economic specialisation .
",
1742,0,," different types of market and different economies grow and contract in different ways .
",
1743,0,," contraction in the housing or heavy industry markets may not happen at the same time as contraction in the software market .
",
1744,0,," at the same time as the collapse of the us housing bubble increated substantial disruption in the financial services market , the market for mineral extraction machinery and services was booming , largely thanks to chinese demand .
",
1745,0,," consequently , some states may experience an economic downturn at a time when others remain stable and productive .
",
1746,0,," thus , the euro harms individual eurozone economies , by restricting their ability to respond to changes in the markets in which they are most heavily involved .
",
1747,0,," this , in turn , increases the likelihood that they will undergo recessions or encounter unmanageable commodity price or asset price inflation .
",
1748,0,," trust in the ecb is likely to dip in states that experience downturns of this type ; public confidence in the wider european project may falter .
",
1749,0,," one of the eu 's broadest objectives is to foster growth and development within its member states .
",
1750,0,," expansion of the eu to include poorer east european and baltic states was prompted partly by this aspirational goal -- and by the large , low cost labour markets that those states contained .
",
1751,0,," public faith in the concept of european integration , and participation in the institutions of the eu is therefore closely tied to the economic opportunities that it can provide .
",
1752,0,," such a distorted allocation of resources will inevitably damage the faith of many member states ' populations in the integration narrative that the eu promotes .
",
1753,0,," from the perspective of an impoverished latvian farmer , or a semi-skilled polish labourer , spending money on ineffective bailouts of the greek and irish economies will seem unjust .
",
1754,0,," the complicated justifications and factionalism underlying attempts to strengthen economies weakened by adoption of the euro obstructs the integration narrative and makes its core message - that europe is working and wants to share its prosperity - seem deeply hypocritical .
",
1755,0,," cynicism or hostility toward an integrated europe has correlated strongly with a rise in xenophobic nationalism in many eu states .
",
1756,0,," the german popular press continues to propagate stereotypes of the greek nation as dysfunctional , workshy and profligate ; far right and anti-immigration political parties have polled strongly in slovakia , england , poland and the baltic states .
",
1757,0,," since, the nationalist sinn fein party has gained substantial influence in the irish parliament .
",
1758,0,," if bailout schemes are allowed to continue , the creation and redistribution of wealth within the eu will come to be seen as a sham .
",
1759,0,," poorer eurozone economies have not been exposed to risky investments and bubble events that have endangered their weaker neighbours , but they still require - and expect - intensive investment and assistance from the eu .
",
1760,0,," the popular perception of german-led bailouts is that good money is being thrown after bad -- the bailouts are seen as threatening the eu 's development and assistance budgets .
",
1761,0,," the core political message that the eu has been seeking to promote is at risk of being compromised by financial mismanagement .
",
1762,0,," in such an environment , resentment of the eu is likely to build , lending authority to the isolationist and xenophobic discourses of nationalist politicians .
",
1763,1,,"california is building a high speed railway line to link its two most populous areas; san francisco and los angeles.
",
1764,1,," the project is staggeringly expensive and has been criticised as too slow by elon musk, the creator of paypal, tesla, and spacex.
",
1765,1,," instead he suggests a new idea he calls the hyperloop to be used between “high traffic city pairs that are less than aboutkm ormiles apart”.
",
1766,1,," beyondmiles musk believes that supersonic jets would be more economic – though of course at the moment there is no supersonic air travel.
",
1767,1,," the route for which the proposal is initially designed from san francisco to los angeles is onlymiles so the hyperloop would be the best possible mode of transport; it would be several times faster than any current commercial transportation method as well as being cheaper.
",
1768,1,,"there are several main elements to the proposal;first it is in a tube the whole distance.
",
1769,1,," the reason for this is to reduce resistance.
",
1770,1,," the tube would be at a much lower pressure than the outside world so there would be less density of air creating less resistance and so allowing faster speeds while using less energy.
",
1771,1,," the tube itself would be on pylons and could be built above existing road infrastructure for much of the way, with the exception of when the corners on the roads are too tight.
",
1772,1,,"despite the low pressure there would still be a build up of air in front of the pod (the individual car in which the users are seated) essentially making it like a syringe with the pod pushing the air in front so once again building up resistance.
",
1773,1,," the hyperloop however would use a compressor fan to transfer air at high pressure to the bottom and rear of the pod.
",
1774,1,," this would allow the creation of an aircushion – musk suggests this is much the same as an air hockey table – underneath the pod so eliminating the need for wheels.
",
1775,1,,"the hyperloop would be powered by electricity.
",
1776,1,," the pod would be initially accelerated by external round induction motors, as used by musk’s own tesla cars, at the stations that would bring the pods to high speeds of aroundmph.
",
1777,1,," the limited resistance would mean there would be no motor operating most of the time but the pods would be given a reboost everymiles or so.
",
1778,1,," the pods themselves would have batteries to power their fan and any internal electronics.
",
1779,1,," as it is all electric musk suggests that by placing solar panels along the top of the tube the hyperloop would generate more than enough electricity to run itself so this would be a green method of travel.
",
1780,1,,"the proposal for the hyperloop provides two separate options for the system; either a passengers only system in which each pod would takepassengers, or one in which the pod would also accommodatevehicles which increases the cost of the system.
",
1781,1,,"the hyperloop would not be anything like any current transportation, musk seems to have described the proposal quite accurately in the months before the announcement as a “cross between a concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table”.
",
1782,1,," it would be like concord in that it is an (almost) supersonic transportation system, a railgun in terms of how the propulsion is created and an air hockey table keeping the pods afloat.
",
1783,0,," public transportation has not been getting much faster over the last few decades .
",
1784,0,," the fastest method of transport , supersonic jets in the form of concorde ceased operation in october.
",
1785,0,," even if at some point a new generation of supersonic planes are built these will not be ideal for travelling between cities that are comparatively close together .
",
1786,0,," the time spent getting the plane up and down from cruising altitude means they would take longer over these short distances than a slower option at ground level .
",
1787,0,," the hyperloop at more than 700mph will be twice as fast as high speed rail .
",
1788,0,," to take the different options on the san francisco-los angeles route cars take 5hours 30minutes , the proposed high speed train would take 2hours 38minutes , by plane takes 1hour 15minutes whereas the hyperloop would only take 35minutes .
",
1789,0,," the hyperloop would be cheap to build .
",
1790,0,," the pods themselves would only cost $ 1.35 million each , the pressurised tube just $ 650million , or double if wanting vehicles , with only two stations their cost would only be $ 250million .
",
1791,0,," the biggest cost would be the construction of the pylons carrying the tube which is estimated at $ 2.55 or $ 3.15 billion .
",
1792,0,," there is an estimated total cost of $ 4.06 billion for the passenger only version or $ 5.31 billion for the vehicle version .
",
1793,0,," this should be compared to the current cost for california 's high speed rail project which is estimated to be $ 68billion while covering much the same ground .
",
1794,0,," the hyperloop would be the cheapest mode of intercity transport possible .
",
1795,0,," `` transporting 7.4 million people each way and amortizing the cost of $billion overyears gives a ticket price of $for a one-way trip for the passenger version of hyperloop . ''
",
1796,0,," there are very few additional costs .
",
1797,0,," usually the main cost for transportation beyond the infrastructure is the energy but the hyperloop produces more energy than it uses so would make a profit here .
",
1798,0,," there would be additional maintenance costs and some minor staff costs but this is unlikely to add too much to the ticket price .
",
1799,0,," the hyperloop would therefore be very price competitive compared to the $and up for flights .
",
1800,1,,"a minimum wage is the minimum price at which firms may hire workers, and conversely at which individuals can sell their labor.
",
1801,1,," the government usually sets the minimum wage level at a point that will increase the wages of the lowest earners.
",
1802,1,," new zealand was the first country to set any kind of minimum wage law when it established arbitration boards in the industrial conciliation and arbitration act of 1894.
",
1803,1,," there is now some kind of minimum wage or collective bargaining legislation over the minimum wage in more than 90% of countries.
",
1804,1,," there are however large differences in terms of the level of the minimum and how it is set.
",
1805,1,," the united kingdom for example has a national minimum wage set at £5.93 per hour for workers overyears old with lower rates for younger people.
",
1806,1,," there is another group of countries that do not have national minimum wages but do have collectively agreed minimum wages.
",
1807,1,," these are usually decided per sector, countries that use this form of collective bargaining to set minimum wages include german and italy.
",
1808,1,," a few countries such as macedonia have no minimum wage at all.
",
1809,1,," opponents of the minimum wage argue that everything should be left to the free market and use supply and demand theory to argue that unemployment will be the result of a minimum, as firms will be unwilling to pay the extra price for workers.
",
1810,1,," proponents however instead focus on social justice and the exploitation of workers, particularly the most vulnerable.
",
1811,0,," businesses operating in a free market are concerned principally with their bottom lines .
",
1812,0,," in order to increase profits , firms will seek to exploit workers , to lower wages as far as possible .
",
1813,0,," this exploitation will continue indefinitely , unless the state intervenes .
",
1814,0,," the state does so by implementing a minimum wage .
",
1815,0,," the lowest paid workers tend to be less educated , less skilled , and less organized than higher-paid employees .
",
1816,0,," this makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace .
",
1817,0,," in order to stop this outright exploitation of the most vulnerable members of society , the power of wage setting must fall to some extent within the purview of the state .
",
1818,0,," certainly , it is far better for state , which has citizens ' best interest at heart , to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses , which tend not to care about their workers ' welfare or have competing interests .
",
1819,0,," furthermore , a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation ; it affirms that all people have worth , can not be exploited , and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce , i.e. a minimum wage .
",
1820,0,," this is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society , by encouraging them to value themselves .
",
1821,0,," also , the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities .
",
1822,0,," citizens of more equal societies tend to have more in common and can share more in the construction of societal goals and aims .
",
1823,0,," this form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage , in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery .
",
1824,0,," without a minimum wage , the lowest paid members of society are relegated to effective serfdom , and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit , accepting similarly low wages .
",
1825,0,," there is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure , since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families .
",
1826,0,," their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages .
",
1827,0,," the minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices .
",
1828,0,," without resources there can be no true choice , as all choices would be coerced by necessity .
",
1829,0,," because people 's choices are intrinsically interconnected , and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply , when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else , he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask , leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another , each competing to prove he is worth the least .
",
1830,0,," a minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition .
",
1831,0,," what the minimum wage does to alleviate these problems is that it gives individuals the ability to pursue the good life , something that has become a global ideal .
",
1832,0,," people want to be happy , and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment .
",
1833,0,," fundamentally , the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited , giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies .
",
1834,0,," employees work harder when they are paid more , but employers can often be more concerned with the short-term bottom line and will not treat workers in the lowest echelons of their firms with much consideration , viewing them instead as disposable and replaceable economic units .
",
1835,0,," mandating a minimum wage can thus benefit firms , even if they do not recognize it , by making workers more productive and also fostering a general work ethic .
",
1836,0,," as workers feel more valued in the economic system , the more likely they are to work loyally and diligently for their employers .
",
1837,0,," furthermore , better pay means more disposable income in the hands of employees , which leads to greater demand by them for goods and services .
",
1838,0,," this demand-induced economic growth is a very important part of economic growth .
",
1839,0,," the more people are able to spend , the more money flows into the economy , leading to more business and higher employment .
",
1840,0,," without the minimum wage , a downward spiral of spending can ensue , proving deleterious to firms and the economy generally .
",
1841,0,," additionally , the minimum wage decreases expensive social welfare payments , since workers no longer need as many supplements to their wages from the state in order to make up for the shortfall created by too-low wages .
",
1842,0,," when wages are extremely low the incentive to enter alternative markets is increased .
",
1843,0,," this is particularly harmful in the case of illegal markets , such as those for drugs or prostitution .
",
1844,0,," when there is little to be gained from obtaining a legitimate job , no matter how plentiful they might be in the absence of a minimum wage , they would be undesirable by comparison to potentially highly lucrative black market opportunities .
",
1845,0,," the minimum wage is essential for keeping the opportunity cost of entering the black market sufficiently high that people opt always to enter the mainstream , legal market .
",
1846,0,," furthermore , when the possibility of work in the legitimate market exists , even if work is harder to find due to a minimum wage , the very possibility of getting such a job will serve as a disincentive to pursuing illegal employment .
",
1847,1,,"sovereign wealth funds (swfs) are investment vehicles owned by governments that wish to invest some of their country’s reserves of money abroad.
",
1848,1,," in the past they tended to be owned by countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil, such as norway and kuwait.
",
1849,1,," these states were keen to invest some of their high resource revenues in the good times, as a hedge against low points in the commodities cycle and the time when their natural wealth becomes exhausted.
",
1850,1,," investing such large sums of money at home was likely to lead to wasteful spending and inflation, as well as concentrating risk, so they sought opportunities abroad in bonds and share markets.
",
1851,1,,"about two-thirds of the value of global swfs is associated with oil wealth, but other emerging economies have also established state-owned companies to invest some of their reserves overseas.
",
1852,1,," as long ago assingapore’s government established temasek as a holding company for state-investments.
",
1853,1,," this has been seen as an important contributor to national prosperity, both through the income it has generated from wise investments, and because of the way it has supported singapore’s emergence as a developed economy with thriving high-tech and financial sectors.
",
1854,1,," more recently asian countries with current account surpluses have built up large government reserves of currency, and have set up sovereign wealth funds in order to generate higher returns on these holdings.
",
1855,1,," it was estimated inthat swfs held $2500 billion in assets, with a projected increase to over £10000 billion by 2012.
",
1856,1,,"swfs vary greatly in their investment strategies, with some like norway’s stabilisation fund or kuwait’s investment authority being content to act as passive investors holding small stakes in hundreds of companies as well as mutual funds, private equity groups and hedge funds.
",
1857,1,," others, such as temasek or dubai international capital are more active, seeking to take substantial positions in foreign companies or even to buy them outright.
",
1858,1,,"concern has been raised over the rapid growth in swf assets, and the impact they may have on international financial markets.
",
1859,1,," more politically controversial in many countries is the motivation behind the more active swfs’ strategies – are they seeking simply to maximise returns for their state owners, or could their purchases be part of a more sinister plan to exploit financial stakes abroad for political reasons?
",
1860,1,," attempts by state-owned companies from china and dubai to buy major american companies ran up against political opposition in 2006-7 and were abandoned, although inflows of money from swfs have been welcomed as part of efforts to shore up shaky banks.
",
1861,1,,"as swfs have become more prominent, many proposals have been put forward to restrain their activities, including voluntary codes promoted by the imf and suggestions that they commit to becoming only passive investors.
",
1862,1,," others, including former us treasury secretary larry summers, have argued for stronger action, such as rules restricting their voting rights or to limit their investment in a company to a maximum level of, say 20%.
",
1863,1,," this topic focuses upon the arguments for and against sovereign wealth funds in general, but does include reference to some of the most popular models of regulation.
",
1864,0,," sovereign wealth funds , swfs , have become very important players in the global economy .
",
1865,0,," the already exceed the assets controlled by hedge funds and will surpass the stock of global foreign exchange reserves .
",
1866,0,," they are now so big that their activities can shift markets , such as norway 's government pension fund did when short selling iceland 's banks , leading to panic and instability when they sell assets suddenly .
",
1867,0,," their purchases can mean that companies owned by other states can end up dominating the economies of smaller countries , undermining their own sovereignty and economic independence .
",
1868,0,," it is also worrying that many swfs are controlled by undemocratic states which have a questionable commitment to capitalism ; should we allow such states to exercise so much power over our economies ?
",
1869,0,," sovereign wealth funds raise worrying issues about national security .
",
1870,0,," unlike mutual funds or private equity groups , which seek only to maximise their investors ' returns , swfs must be regarded as political entities .
",
1871,0,," rather than passively holding their assets , they may seek to use their purchases to gain access to natural resources , advanced technologies , including those crucial to our defence , or other strategic sectors .
",
1872,0,," for example gulf states are using their swfs to invest in food and natural resources from latin america .
",
1873,0,," they may engage in economic nationalism , shutting factories in western countries to give an unfair advantage to their own industries .
",
1874,0,," while it has not yet happened they may even attempt economic blackmail , threatening to turn off the lights through their control of energy companies and utilities if governments do not fall in with their foreign policy aims .
",
1875,0,," allowing countries such as china , russia and various gulf states to buy up western companies at will is potentially very dangerous .
",
1876,0,," even if we regard these states as friendly at the moment , there is no guarantee that they will stay that way , especially as none of them share our political values .
",
1877,0,," sovereign wealth funds suffer from an almost total lack of transparency .
",
1878,0,," most countries maintain secrecy about the size of their funds and the extent of their holdings , their accountability to government , their investment strategies and their approach to risk management .
",
1879,0,," without knowing these things , it is impossible to gauge whether political or economic objectives will dominate the swfs ' behaviour , or indeed whether they will make safe and responsible shareholders in any business -- secrecy breeds corruption .
",
1880,0,," for these reasons , jeffrey garten of yale has argued that swfs should be obliged to publish independently audited accounts twice a year .
",
1881,0,," he has also pointed out that many countries operating swfs protect their domestic economy from foreign competition and investment .
",
1882,0,," we should demand reciprocity , so that countries seeking investments abroad must open up their own economies fully before they are allowed to hold significant assets elsewhere .
",
1883,0,," the ownership of important businesses by sovereign wealth funds runs counter to the economic policy pursued by almost every government over the pastyears .
",
1884,0,," in the 1970s many states owned nationalised industries as part of an attempt at socialist economic planning that has now been discredited .
",
1885,0,," state ownership distorted incentives , interfered with management and produced decades of underinvestment , poor service to consumers , and national economic failure with the most extreme example being the soviet union itself .
",
1886,0,," since the 1980s countries everywhere have followed the example of thatcher 's britain and privatised their industries , freeing them to compete efficiently and to generate more wealth and jobs than they had ever done in state hands .
",
1887,0,," going back to state ownership of business is a dangerous backward step , especially as it is now foreign governments that are doing the nationalising .
",
1888,0,," a number of possible models of regulation have been suggested for sovereign wealth funds .
",
1889,0,," some , such as gilson and milhaupt , have argued that state-owned investment vehicles that buy shares abroad should not be allowed voting rights in that stock .
",
1890,0,," others would put a cap on swf investments , so that they can not take a stake of more than , say% in any business without government approval within the country the swf is investing in -- meaning that they can only be passive investors .
",
1891,0,," both these proposals would ensure that they are unable to abuse a dominant position while still allowing countries to benefit from cross-border investment in a globalised economy .
",
1892,0,," at the same time such rules would prevent any broader protectionist backlash so the sovereign wealth funds themselves could welcome the regulation .
",
1893,1,,"developmental aid exists in a variety of forms such as the official developmental assistance (oda) awarded by donor nations in the un’s development assistance committee (dac).
",
1894,1,,"   these flows of official financing are given with the aim of “promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective…”.
",
1895,1,," although there may be discussion over what parameters or index should be used to measure the overall development of a nation, the success of the awarded aid depends largely on the localised effects of the particular aid projects and any wider results that have been obtained.
",
1896,1,," oda often has strings attached to the aid, but this usually is conditions such as equipment having to be bought from the country that is providing the aid.
",
1897,1,," there may sometimes be other conditions such as a country being unwilling to give development assistance to countries that have particularly poor human rights records, though this will almost certainly not apply to any emergency aid.
",
1898,1,," for example the uk suspended aid to rwanda at the end ofin response to reports showing rwanda was fueling the civil war in neighbouring congo.
",
1899,1,,"this however does not usually translate into action in other similar areas.
",
1900,1,," in the contexts of scarce accountability and poor labour standards, development aid often carries on regardless.
",
1901,1,," this is despite international labour standards, being particularly suited to ensure that economic development remains concentrated on improving human life and dignity by making sure that economic growth and development go along with the creation of decent work.
",
1902,1,," in other words labour standards could be seen as a core part of any sustainable development that such aid is aiming to achieve.
",
1903,1,," should raising labour standards therefore, to increase the efficacy of aid, be considered a pre-requisite for development aid.
",
1904,1,," whether this is a fair, efficient and more importantly, achievable criterion to be met by developing nations is the keystone focus of this debate.
",
1905,0,," labour and business standards are a cornerstone of agreement on universal human rights between various international actors and so it is right that they should be linked to aid .
",
1906,0,," inthe ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work were adopted and are considered binding on all members regardless of whether they have ratified the conventions .
",
1907,0,," the business and labour regulations protect the basic worker rights and improve job security through demanding the elimination of discrimination and empower workers through the recognition of `` freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining '' like in those in developed western countries .
",
1908,0,," this then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up .
",
1909,0,," it would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid .
",
1910,0,," it should be remembered that there has been general acceptance of international labour standards not just for human rights reasons but also because having minimum standards is beneficial economically -- for example ahour working week is more productive per hour than ahour week .
",
1911,0,," what are international labour and business standards ?
",
1912,0,," they are globally acceptable methods of doing business and employing labour .
",
1913,0,," these include conventions against forced labour , discrimination and child labour .
",
1914,0,," these also form guideline structures for social policy such as labour dispute resolution bodies , employment services and good industrial relations .
",
1915,0,," therefore , this goes hand in hand with reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living of the employees , and hence the standard is a facet of development in itself .
",
1916,0,," this helps in achieving the goals of a stable long term plan for economic growth as well paid workers are necessary for consumer spending .
",
1917,0,," employing higher standards would be a way to tackle the problems with distribution of aid at the grassroots and increase efficiency within the system organically .
",
1918,0,," the poorest countries invariably have the lowest standards of labour and business .
",
1919,0,," it is essential to raise these standards to an international level , implementing standards against practices like child labour .
",
1920,0,," if this is done then the purpose of development aid , which is to increase the day to day standard of living of the people , will improve .
",
1921,0,," in an absence of such a pre-requisite , a developing country will be free to employ standards that do not reflect the same principles of the donor nation .
",
1922,0,," thus , to avoid a hypocritical scenario , this pre-requisite is necessary .
",
1923,0,," increasing the required standard of business and labour will result in increases to the current standard labour and business standards even before aid is entirely tied as countries implement changes to ensure they get the most possible aid .
",
1924,0,," simply setting an expected level of labour and business standards will therefore create improvement in those standards .
",
1925,0,," in the case of the decent work country programme for bangladesh 2006-2009 bangladesh has been implementing the program due to its positive benefit towards achieving the millennium development goals .
",
1926,0,," this is despite challenges such as the lack of employment opportunities in the country .
",
1927,0,," the programme has been successful in improving social protection , working conditions and rights for female , male , and children workers in a few sectors and areas .
",
1928,0,," when a donor nation parts with foreign aid for development to a nation , it must always choose who it prefers to give it to as there is a limited pot of money to donate there needs to be a way of allocating it .
",
1929,0,," it is not surprising therefore that countries with shared colonial histories tend to dominate aid flows , thus britain has historically given most aid to countries that were its colonies ; inmalta and cyprus received most , while india was the biggest recipient for much of the rest of the 20th century .
",
1930,0,," further , often countries offering aid , such as the us , the uk , and the eu , require the pre-requisite of democracy or the start of a democratisation process .
",
1931,0,," therefore , it is justified to add a pre-requisite for better standards of business and labour as it helps implementation , and principally meets the goals of the developmental aid itself .
",
1932,0,," as long as developing nations constantly keep employing poor labour standards , it will keep putting a strain on the global economy .
",
1933,0,," this is because other countries will be pressured to do the same just to remain competitive .
",
1934,0,," this creates a race to the bottom effect and would create `` poor conditions and loss of freedom in the global south , and causes workers in the global north to lose their jobs to cheap outsourced labour '' .
",
1935,0,," higher labour standards in developing countries therefore also benefits developed countries .
",
1936,0,," however the converse is also true ; labels like ` fair trade ' provide a guarantee of ethical quality and show that consumers are willing to pay more to ensure good labour standards .
",
1937,1,,"it has for a long time been recognized that migration is in large part caused by economic factors; people leave poorer rural areas and move to the city, they move from less developed to more developed countries.
",
1938,1,," in each case they are looking for a better life so go to somewhere where they believe they will find it.
",
1939,1,," it has however usually been considered that these people moving around the world in search of work are doing so mostly for themselves, instead it is increasingly clear that they are doing it as much for their families who have been left behind.
",
1940,1,,"the flow of money from migrants has been shooting up in recent years, according to the world bank remittances topped $530 billion in 2012.
",
1941,1,," this represents a tripling of remittances within the last decade and indeed it is likely that the amount of money being transferred is much higher as many migrants bypass banks and big money transfer companies that provide the date the world bank is using.
",
1942,1,,"with such huge amounts of money being sent home we might very well ask whether migration could be a driver of development rather than relying on aid?
",
1943,1,," the level of flows of money recorded by the world bank is more than three times the total of global aid budgets and of course it does not have strings attached to how it is spent.
",
1944,1,," many countries get huge amounts from remittances; india and china each received more than £60billion, the philippines and mexico both had $24billion sent, while nigeria received $21 billion.
",
1945,1,," for the philippines in particular $24 billion would represent more than 10% of the country’s gdp.
",
1946,1,," for some small countries this can be even higher, in liberia remittances receive the equivalent of 31% of the country’s gdp.
",
1947,1,," the amounts are so big that several countries, including the philippines, have sent up ministries to manage the cash sent from overseas.
",
1948,1,,"clearly the proposal is not to replace all aid with no change to remittances; this would just be taking something away so would be in no way beneficial to those who receive aid.
",
1949,1,," instead official development assistance, “grants and concessional loans for development and welfare purposes from the government sector of a donor country to a developing country or multilateral agency active in development”,  would be replaced with increased remittances.
",
1950,1,," this would be spurred by governments taking action in several ways; providing tax breaks and incentives for those sending home remittances, and by reducing the cost of sending money home by dropping the cut taken by banks and wire transfer firms.
",
1951,1,," the g8 has pledged to reduce the cost of global transfers to an average of 5% by 2014, which would be a significant drop from the 9% it is at the moment and the average should be brought down to the 2-3% where it would be if there was sufficient competition.
",
1952,1,,"note: for the purposes of this debate we are not going to go into detail about whether this will result in more or less money going to developing nations.
",
1953,1,," it will be assumed that the developed countries would be giving as much by their tax breaks and reductions in costs as they would be in aid.
",
1954,1,," this does not seem too unreasonable, oda from oecd countries was $135bln in 2011, a drop in transfer costs of 7% would save $37bln, and the rest would be made up by tax breaks and incentives.
",
1955,0,,"  changing from oda to remittances is good for freedom of choice in two ways .
",
1956,0,," first tax breaks and other incentives will mean that migrants have more money .
",
1957,0,," it will clearly be up to the migrant to decide if they want to or can afford to send their money home ; they can decide how much they want to send , when they want to end it , how they want to send it etc, at the other end it will be up to the individual recipient to decide how they want to spend the money received .
",
1958,0,," secondly it is good for the freedom of choice of the taxpayer .
",
1959,0,," at the moment they are having their choice taken away from them as they have their own money being spent by the government on someone else ; foreign countries .
",
1960,0,," the individual taxpayer sees none of the benefit of this money and often they do n't like paying so much aid ,% of americans support cutting aid .
",
1961,0,," rwanda has been trying to increase the size of remittances in order to increase its autonomy .
",
1962,0,," the president paul kagame has said `` aid is never enough and we need to complement it with homegrown schemes to accelerate growth . ''
",
1963,0,," he wants `` a higher level of direct ownership in the nation 's projects '' and wants it because western donors had suspended aid .
",
1964,0,," a change to remittances would reduce this vulnerability ; it would be much more difficult for ` donors ' to suspend the tax breaks they provide for remittances to individual countries than it is to cut aid .
",
1965,0,," indeed remittances are noticeably stable with money still being sent home during recessions and can even be countercyclical as migrants will send more if they know things are bad back home .
",
1966,0,," this then takes the issue out of the hands of the politicians and puts it into the hands of the people .
",
1967,0,," there has been a lot of concern that aid , particularly from governments and international organisations , does not always help reduce poverty ; it might simply create dependence , or it prevents local enterprise .
",
1968,0,," dambisa moyo points out that `` betweenand, when aid flows to africa were at their peak , poverty in africa rose from% to a staggering% '' .
",
1969,0,," remittances on the other hand can be very beneficial ; they provide the money needed to start enterprises , and they are showing that the community is not dependent as its members have taken the initiative to go and find work .
",
1970,0,," remittances have a statistically significant impact on reducing poverty .
",
1971,0,," inthe world bank suggested that a% increase in per capita international remittances will lead to a 3.5 % decline in the share of people living in poverty .
",
1972,0,," governments should therefore change from the method that is failing to one that is more successful at reducing poverty .
",
1973,1,,"in the past two decades the internet has come to be a dominant part of people’s lives.
",
1974,1,," for work, pleasure, staying in touch, and countless other uses, the internet has become an indispensable tool for many individuals.
",
1975,1,," without it, much of the information-based civilization that has been built up would stop working the way we are accustomed to.
",
1976,1,," as the internet has become more important so too have access to the most cutting-edge systems to provide high speed, security, and data storage become critical.
",
1977,1,," broadband internet provides the fastest access to the internet, and is now essential to the functioning of the economy both globally and locally.
",
1978,1,,"the increased importance of the internet has spurred a significant debate over the nature of the rights to access it.
",
1979,1,," is internet access now a fundamental right because it is a critical tool in the expression of other freedoms such as the freedom of expression?
",
1980,1,," as yet there is no consensus on an answer.
",
1981,1,," the united nations special rapporteur on the freedom of expression has stated “given that the internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the internet should be a priority for all states.”
",
1982,1,," many countries, including france, costa rica, spain, and greece have all legally enshrined the right to internet access.
",
1983,1,," most countries have not yet followed suit, though vigorous debate flourishes in many polities, such as the united states and united kingdom.
",
1984,1,,"if internet access is a human right, or even recognised simply as being important for everyone to have, then how should it be ensured that everyone has access?
",
1985,1,," some suggest that governments have a duty to provide service through monopolies run by state companies, and that these services would be more efficient than private provision.
",
1986,1,," others say it is the place of the private sector to provide these services, and that it is always the private sector, absent state bureaucracy, that provides the superior service, especially if the state were to make provisions to guarantee service to everyone.
",
1987,1,,"this seeks to piece out the case for each side by examining the rights to internet, the risks state provision entails, and the relative cost savings or accruals from state internet providers.
",
1988,1,," for the sake of this debate it is worthwhile to limit the scope to the developed world, where the possibility of providing extensive broadband service is a realistic policy.
",
1989,0,," as information technology has come more and more to pervade people 's lives , it has become abundantly clear that a new set of positive rights must be considered .
",
1990,0,," in the forefront of this consideration stands broadband .
",
1991,0,," broadband allows for far more rapid access to the internet , and thus access to the world of information the internet represents .
",
1992,0,," today , a citizen of a free society must be able to access the internet if he or she is to be able to fully realise their potential .
",
1993,0,," this is because the ability to access the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and civic and social participation are now contingent upon ready access to the internet .
",
1994,0,," thus access to the internet has itself become a right of citizens , and their access should be guaranteed by the state .
",
1995,0,," this right has been enshrined by several countries , such as france , finland , greece , and spain , thus leading the way toward a more general recognition of this service as a right in the same way other public services are guaranteed .
",
1996,0,," it is a right derived from the evolution of society in the same fashion that the right to healthcare has grown out of countries ' social and economic development .
",
1997,0,," a single , universal provider of broadband would allow the government to rationalize the management and development of the service .
",
1998,0,," multiple private service-providers ultimately end up causing three serious problems .
",
1999,0,," the first two are straightforward , that private firms competing in the same area waste money creating multiple distribution channels that are unnecessary for the number of consumers , and that when they opt not to compete they end up dividing up territory into effective utility monopolies .
",
2000,0,," the third problem is especially salient to the state when it is attempting to provide for everyone : many areas are too sparsely populated or economically underdeveloped that private firms are unwilling to invest in them ; these areas are entirely dependent on state intervention to allow them to get broadband access .
",
2001,0,," thus for example , in the united statesmillion people in the united states still have no broadband access .
",
2002,0,," much like electrical and water utilities , a single provider can create the most efficient outcome for consumers , and when that provider is the state it can guarantee affordable prices and commit to not price-gouging as private firms are wont to do .
",
2003,0,," broadband should be treated as a utility , and the state has always proven to be the best purveyor of public utilities .
",
2004,0,," information technology is critical to the success of contemporary economies , with even the simplest business ventures .
",
2005,0,," uneven or non-existent penetration of broadband is a major drag on economic progress .
",
2006,0,," the private sector has been unable to effectively adapt with a holistic approach to the provision of data space and internet speed .
",
2007,0,," the state providing these services would guarantee a high quality of service , and penetration across the country , linking all citizens to the network .
",
2008,0,," for a country to compete internationally it needs broadband , and the surest way to provide it , since the private sector has resolutely failed to do so , and where it does provide services , it tends to overcharge .
",
2009,0,," as the western world is left behind by the internet speeds of erstwhile developing states like singapore , which has almost total penetration of high quality , state-sponsored broadband , it needs to refocus on what can reverse the trend .
",
2010,0,," broadband is one of the steps toward the solution .
",
2011,0,," advanced infrastructure technology often relies on the existence of broadband technology universally installed across the grid .
",
2012,0,," countries like south korea and japan have succeeded in expanding their power grids by means of `` smart grids '' , power-grids that are far more efficient than existing structures in previously leading states like the united states , that make use of the broadband network in the provision of power .
",
2013,0,," the us government has since committed to creating its own new grid , one that would increase efficiency , supply and management , and lower costs of energy provision to its citizens .
",
2014,0,," such grids depend on the reliable and advanced broadband networks .
",
2015,0,," the incentive for states to employ broadband across their territory is tremendous , beyond mere access to fast internet .
",
2016,0,," this is why private firms will never be sufficient in efficient provision of broadband , because they do not reap all the benefits directly of the smart grid that can arise from its development .
",
2017,0,," the state providing broadband is an essential part of upgrading energy provision for advanced countries in the 21st century .
",
2018,1,,"governments often face a dilemma wherein the public wants more services but also to pay less tax.
",
2019,1,," both are beneficial to the nation’s economy; the more a government invests in education, health care, and other services, the more productive its population will be.
",
2020,1,," however, lower taxation allows individuals to invest more money, thereby allowing more business growth.
",
2021,1,," governments often try to resolve this dilemma through temporary budget deficits, which as these deficits can be difficult to reduce and pay back often lead to long-term debt.
",
2022,1,," relatively large deficits are often essential in the short term due to the government being a last resort for stabilizing the economy and encouraging growth.
",
2023,1,," when in a crisis the government has to step in, as happened inwhen britain and ireland bailed out their banking sectors.
",
2024,1,,"  governments also need to have a certain amount of debt in order to function as they need to be able to raise short term loans in order to make up for taxes not consistently coming in on time.
",
2025,1,," however many governments, particularly in europe, have found that their debt levels are getting too high.
",
2026,1,," the highest debts in europe are greece whose debts are 165% of gdp (gdp is the output of a nation so equivalent to comparing debt to income), italy 120%, ireland 107% and portugal 103% but the major european powers also have high debts france’s national debt is at 86% of gdp, germany at 82% and the uk at 80%.
",
2027,1,,"the eurozone has been facing a sovereign debt crisis since the end of 2009, on 1st maygreece was bailed out for the first time with a €110 billion loan, followed being given a €67.5 billion bailout on the 29th november.
",
2028,1,," portugal was the next state needing a bail out and it received a €78 billion bailout on the 16th may 2011.
",
2029,1,," the causes of each government’s difficulties were different, irelands was originally caused by a property bubble, greece’s by poor accounting and generous pay and pensions and portugal through mismanagement of public investment.
",
2030,1,," however all caused the same concern of ‘financial contagion’ where financial crisis in one country can spread quickly to other countries due to the interconnectedness of the financial system.
",
2031,1,," so for example italy owes french banks €309 billion, if it were to default on these debts these french banks will then likely need bailouts from the french government that in turn may have difficulties raising enough money.
",
2032,1,," all of these bailouts had conditions attached, mostly austerity to get budget deficits under control.
",
2033,1,," however at the moment in europe austerity is the norm and even countries that have not been bailed out have been following pushing through austerity governments.
",
2034,1,," these measures are accompanied by considerable criticism and debate about the necessity of the measures, whether cuts are too far and too fast and even if cuts are needed at all.
",
2035,1,," debates concerning the benefits of a balanced budget include both economic arguments- the extent to which debt can help/harm a nation- as well as moral issues about a government’s place in society.
",
2036,1,," while this debate is focused on europe it also draws in examples from other countries around the world.

",
2038,0,,"  government bonds compete with private company bonds .
",
2039,0,," furthermore , government bonds are often more reliable than private bonds , the uk for example prides itself on having never defaulted , thereby giving the government an additional advantage over private companies .
",
2040,0,," this is especially the case in a financial crisis or economic downturn where there are worries about the creditworthiness of companies .
",
2041,0,," crowding out creates a vicious cycle ; less investment in the private sector leads to less growth , thereby increasing the need for government programs , which increases the need for government spending and more government bonds on the market .
",
2042,0,," italy 's current debt exemplifies the problem with compiling debt by running even small deficits over a long period .
",
2043,0,," italy 's budget deficit is low at 3.9 % of gdp inless than france 's 5.3 % , and even has a primary budget surplus , before the interest payments on debt is included .
",
2044,0,," italy 's crisis is not new with its debt having breached% of gdp two decades ago in.
",
2045,0,," the problem is that this high debt makes italy very vulnerable to economic shocks .
",
2046,0,," it can not afford to , for example , bail out banks or increase welfare and spending to boost the economy .
",
2047,0,," italy 's credit rating in the 1990s was the highest rating , triple a , it has since declined to a + .
",
2048,0,," as this rating shows how likely governments are perceived to be to default declines in credit ratings mean declines in confidence and increases in interest rates .
",
2049,0,," if investors lose confidence and interest rates on its debts rise then it will be paying much more of its budget simply to repay loans .
",
2050,0,," if interest rates rise by% italy would have to pay an extra $ 38bn over three years .
",
2051,0,," large debts are therefore not sustainable and reduce the ability of the government to pay for other things .
",
2052,0,," japan , whose national debt stands at% of gdp , has accumulated debt partially due to social programs for its aging population .
",
2053,0,," today , japan struggles merely to make interest payments on its debt , thereby preventing it from directing its funds towards reducing the debt itself .
",
2054,0,," europe has the same problem , albeit in a less severe form .
",
2055,0,," once government entitlement programs are established , they are very difficult to get eliminate .
",
2056,0,," once these programs become unaffordable , the government finds itself in a situation of perpetual debt that it can not get out of .
",
2057,0,," this is a particular problem in europe as the continent is aging .
",
2058,0,," every member of the european union has an aging population .
",
2059,0,," encouraging economic growth in countries that are old and getting older is difficult because they are less inclined to take risks and be innovative .
",
2060,0,," while growth and thus tax take slows the costs to the government will rise due to increasing healthcare costs and pensions .
",
2061,0,," thus , a balanced budget must be a government 's first priority .
",
2062,0,," excess government debt can have devastating consequences for a nation 's population .
",
2063,0,," for example , when germany lost wwi and was forced to pay reparations it could not afford it resolved its debt through hyperinflation which devastated civilians ' savings .
",
2064,0,," although this is an extreme example , governments must default , make big raises in tax rates , print more money , or otherwise manipulate currency in order to resolve debt crises .
",
2065,0,," when individuals go into debt , they suffer the consequences themselves .
",
2066,0,," when government leaders decide to have an unbalanced budget , the entire country suffers for their mistakes .
",
2067,0,," the government is abandoning its duty to do what is best for its people when it gets too far into debt .
",
2068,0,," it is not right for governments to take such risks that can have such devastating effects .
",
2069,1,,"according to the bible, the ten commandments (or decalogue) are a list of laws handed down from god to moses, and as such they are highly revered in christianity and judaism.
",
2070,1,," different sects of christianity and judaism often use different texts for the decalogue, and islam's holy book, the qur'an, mentions the commandments, though it does not list them.
",
2071,1,," regardless of what form the laws take, they are frequently seen as being highly charged with religious meaning.
",
2072,1,," some public schools in the past have displayed the ten commandments, as have other state institutions such as courthouses.
",
2073,1,," this has prompted various organizations, such as the american civil liberties union (aclu) to present legal challenges to the displays.
",
2074,1,," in 1980, the supreme court of the united states ruled in stone v. graham that the ten commandments could not be displayed in schools, but the issue of state display of the text continues to be controversial and many religious activists frequently try to have the decision overturned.
",
2075,1,," more recent supreme court cases regarding the ten commandments on state property1 have resulted in divided rulings and no principled conclusion.
",
2076,0,," while most of these arguments can be applied to debates about religion and state more broadly, this topic is framed in the context of the usa, where the debate most commonly takes place.
",
2077,0,,"there are very difficult issues involved here ; students will not easily understand whether the prohibition on killing applies to the death penalty , wars , assisted suicide , and a number of other very sensitive public policies subject to intense debate .1 likewise , the prohibition against adultery could be interpreted as not banning pre-marital relations , non-coital sexual behaviour , and other actions the state may not in fact wish to endorse .2 1rev .

",
2081,0,," it is against the ten commandments to believe in `` other gods '' , but we expressly permit belief in other religious systems and atheism via constitutional protections .
",
2082,0,," not only is this a violation of the principle of separation , but it also sends a mixed message to those groups , and runs the risk of alienating those who do not conform to these ideals .1 posting the decalogue is obviously tremendously divisive - a serious culture war of lawsuits , protests , and speech has been waged over the issue .
",

",
2087,0,," this is a profoundly sensitive issue and any perceived favouritism on the part of the government would simply result in a greater backlash .
",
2088,0,," better to sidestep this problem altogether and have a blanket policy against posting the decalogue .
",
2089,0,," our legislators must be conscious of the dangers of wrapping the ten commandments in the flag and indicating that one faith or religious set of laws is more patriotic or representative of the nation 's fundamental values than another .1 that idea can easily be used as a weapon against a minority 's group rights as well as their sense of belonging to the country .

2093,1,,"the term curriculum refers to the programme of study in various academic subjects (e.g maths, english, history, science, spanish) followed by students at various levels of education.
",
2094,1,," the school or college's teaching staff are employed to teach this curriculum, and students are periodically assessed (e.g. by exams and term papers) in their progress in each curriculum subject.
",
2095,1,," as they grow older, students' achievements in their curriculum subjects are seen as important in helping them get into a good university or college, and to find a good job when they leave education.
",
2096,1,," depending on which country you are in, schools and colleges may also be held accountable for their students' results in the curriculum subjects.
",
2097,1,,"the academic curriculum has never been all that schools and colleges offer to their students.
",
2098,1,," often a range of other classes, clubs and activities is available to students, sometimes in lessons but more often in the lunch break or after school.
",
2099,1,," these are referred to as extra-curricular activities and they are mostly voluntary for students.
",
2100,1,," examples would include sports, musical activities, debate, model united nations, community service, religious study groups, charitable fundraising, young enterprise projects, military cadet activities, drama, science clubs, and hobbies such as gardening, crafts, cookery and dance.
",
2101,1,," because they are not examined in the same way that the academic curriculum is, and because most of them take place outside lessons, such activities have less status in education than the main curriculum.
",
2102,1,," however, they are often held to be very important to the wider education of young men and women.
",
2103,0,," this topic examines whether the extra-curriculum should be given more importance in schools and collegesthe normal curriculum can only go so far as to teach and educate students about academic theories .
",
2104,0,," but students whose only experience of school or college is one of rigid academic study may not be able to apply what they have learned in practice .1 extra curricular activities encourage a diverse range of skills and methods of learning that encompass the diverse needs of students .
",
2105,0,," for example , schemes such as young enterprise allow students to experience of practical business skills and valuable communication and team work skills .
",
2106,0,," if the extra-curriculum was given an equal footing in student life there will be an improvement in the student ability to grasp things as a whole , because students will have received a more rounded education .
",
2107,0,," many children have talents in all sorts of different areas , and it is wrong to force them to specialise too early .
",
2108,0,," ` every child and young person is entitled to experience a broad general education 'even if a student does not aim to be a professional musician they should still have opportunity to learn an instrument .
",
2109,0,," a career is not the only , or most the important , part of an adult 's life -- school needs to make sure they have interests and skills that will help them in their family and leisure lives too .
",
2110,0,," through equal balancing of academic and extra-curriculum , however , the students have the chance to exercise their rights , learn a diverse range of skills and the opportunity to be multi-talented .
",
2111,0,," most extra-curricular activities are physically active , getting the student out from behind their desk and making them try new things .
",
2112,0,," physical activity is extremely important for general health whilst ensuring that students are exposed to practical tasks , not just what is taught in class .1 sports clubs and teams give students the opportunity to do physical exercise in an enjoyable environment whilst activities such as the duke of edinburgh award teach skills such as map reading and organisation of a group .
",
2113,0,," the outcome of giving the extra-curriculum the same status as the curriculum will therefore be well balanced individuals .
",
2114,0,," schools have a pastoral duty to consider the well-being of their pupils which includes physical health and practical abilities .
",
2115,0,," boosting the place of the extra-curriculum in schools is one way of addressing a weakness in modern society , a lack of civil strength and community .
",
2116,0,," activities offered in schools are vital in providing opportunities to learn the diverse skills help to equip young people with the civic spirit , initiative and organising skills to set up their own clubs , teams and activity groups when they leave education .
",
2117,0,," an article in the guardian argues that ` the riots suggest that the education system must concern itself with a lot more than simple exam results ' .1 a successful extra-curriculum often depends on building links between the school and the wider community , bringing local enthusiasts in to work with students , and sending students out to work on community projects , help in primary schools , perform for local audiences , etc, thus , extra-curricular activities have wider social implications than the individual schools and pupils .
",
2118,1,,"in the uk, physical education (pe) is compulsory in state schools until the age of– that is, that sports are compulsory for as long as education is compulsory.
",
2119,1,," every year, more and more parents complain to their children’s schools about pe; they believe that their children shouldn’t have to participate in physical activity if they don’t want to and that it is not a conducive educational activity or environment.
",
2120,1,," proponents of pe, however, believe that it is a crucial element of all-round schooling and our society’s well-being, particularly with the contemporary rise in levels of obesity in the developed world and the proliferation of high-fat, sugary food and drink.
",
2121,0,," they insist pe in schools remains one of the few places whereby the youth can be forced to participate in aerobic exercise.
",
2122,0,,"participation in sport promotes health .
",
2123,0,," the effect on self-esteem and well-being as a product of sport can only be experienced by certain children if forced by their schools to first participate .
",
2124,0,," a recent report to the european parliament declared ` physical education is a springboard for involvement in sport and physical activities throughout life ' .
",
2125,0,," government is , or should be , concerned with the health of its citizens .
",
2126,0,," encouraging physical activity in the young through compulsory pe fights child obesity and contributes to forming lifelong habits of exercise .
",
2127,0,," this does n't have to be through traditional team sports ; increasingly schools are able to offer exercise in the form of swimming , gymnastics , dance , weight training , use of a multi-gym , aerobics , etc physical education helps to forge character and the mutual respect required to succeed in an adult environment .
",
2128,0,," playing team sports builds character and encourages students to work with others , as they would be expected to do in most business or sporting environments .
",
2129,0,," sport teaches children how to win and lose with good grace and builds a strong school spirit through competition with other institutions .
",
2130,0,," it is invaluable to imbue with children the delicate balance between a competitive rivalry that encourages effort and , on the other hand , losing the fairness and respect required to enjoy sport .
",
2131,0,," it is often the experience of playing on a team together which builds the strongest friendships at school , which endure for years afterwards .
",
2132,0,," as was noted in a report to the european parliament , ` pe ... helps children learn to respect and value their own bodies and abilities , and those of others ' .
",
2133,0,," compulsory physical education is the only means by which all children can be forced to appreciate such advantages .
",
2134,0,," the quest for national sporting achievement begins in schools .
",
2135,0,," if schools do n't have compulsory pe , it is much harder to pick out , develop and equip athletes to represent the country on a wider stage .
",
2136,0,," even with a ` sports academy ' model run along australian lines , it 's much easier to find suitable individuals with a full sports program in every school .
",
2137,0,," in the uk seventy per cent of state-school students are dropping pe when it becomes optional ; it is no surprise that up to% of its olympic athletes are now privately-educated , where physical education is compulsory until the end of one 's education .
",
2138,0,," state education is not just about aiding the individual it 's also about the state getting a good return on its investment -- in a well-educated populace to drive business and entrepreneurialism etc, this applies equally in sports .
",
2139,0,," without school support , sports will collapse .
",
2140,0,," if compulsory physical education classes are n't in place , then team activities will end by sheer lack of numbers , no matter if several very talented individuals are at the school , or even potentially talented -- they 'll never know without the program .
",
2141,0,," new surveys in the united kingdom have found that they expect to see a fall in sporting events provided in schools due to cost-cutting , despite the upcoming olympics inspiring students to want to compete .
",
2142,0,," if voluntary take-up of sport in schools is too low , then schools will shut down pe programmes so that there is no choice at all .
",
2143,0,," not everyone is academic : why deprive those talented sports students of their one chance to shine ?
",
2144,0,," athletes who lack academic prowess are required to stick at classes like maths even if it appears obvious their career path is in sport ; why should mathematicians escape from their respective obligation to compete in sports ?
",
2145,0,," compulsory pe lessons can be treated in the same manner an ordinary educational class is treated ; if the student refuses to participate and therefore does not do their work , they are punished with extra work of that same class .
",
2146,0,," in this case , that would necessitate added physical education exercises at a later date or immediately after the class .
",
2147,0,," the excuse that the student does not wish to participate in the class should be seen as no different to if it were stated during a maths or english class , where it would not be accepted .
",
2148,0,," the fact that physical education is qualitatively different to those classes is irrespective ; once deemed a compulsory subject , and therefore beneficial , it must be accepted and completed .
",
2149,1,,"home schooling is the education of children at home.
",
2150,1,," the practice is legal in most countries but the extent to which it is practised varies.
",
2151,1,," within europe, for example in the netherlands parents have a duty to send their children to a school, and germany forbade home schooling until recent decisions ruled this contrary to human rights legislation.
",
2152,1,," the extent of regulation varies considerably; austria for instance has an annual testing regime but elsewhere monitoring may be left to regional authorities with varying results or may not exist at all.
",
2153,1,," there is not much data about the number of home-educated children in western europe, except for britain where there are three to four thousand children educated at home, and germany where there are onlyor so following the recent change in the law.
",
2154,1,," home-schooling is comparatively popular in the usa and is legal in every state but it is a major political issue and the level of difficulty encountered by parents wishing to teach and parents removing their children from the state system varies between states.
",
2155,1,," here, the arguments will not be specific to any nation, but take place within the context of liberal democracies with a reasonable standard of educational provision and assumes that home educators would be subject to regulation.
",
2156,1,," proponents of the practice argue that parents have a right to decide where best to educate their child, and that the home is often ideal as a learning environment.
",
2157,0,," opponents argue that schools, in contrast, offer ideal learning environments and that education requires properly-trained teachers in appropriate settings, which a home and well-intentioned parents cannot provide.
",
2158,0,,"homeschooling families do not operate in isolation .
",
2159,0,," there are extensive support networks , particularly in the usa the nation with the largest proportion of the population homeschooling , that exist to provide companionship , promote sports events and social functions .
",
2160,0,," in addition , standard social provisions for children in civic society -- scout movements , sports club -- are open to homeschoolers .
",
2161,0,," homeschooling is not a removal from society but just from state schools .1 homeschooled children often engage with their local community to a greater extent than their schooled peers .
",
2162,0,," home schooling allows children to learn in an environment that has the needs of one or a very few number of students as the focus of the educative process .
",
2163,0,," parents are willing to invest in their children and can provide targeted provision that prioritises the learning needs of those individuals1 .
",
2164,0,," therefore , specific textbooks that are tailored to the child 's mode of learning can be purchased .
",
2165,0,," state schools , in contrast , are often very ill-equipped and under-funded , leading to standardized text books and teaching methods .
",
2166,0,," the home also lacks the many distractions and disadvantages of schools : peer pressure , social stigma attached to achievement , bullying , show-offs and general rowdiness .
",
2167,0,," 1 ` virtues in to vices ' in the journal of home education family bonding is a massively important element of a child 's development and is prioritised by home schooling1 .
",
2168,0,," the value of the family is constantly undermined in modern society ; positive parental role models are found less and less frequently .
",
2169,0,," if a parent is judged by a state vetting process to be good enough it is enormously beneficial for society as a whole to approve is an environment that cements both a positive role model and family bonding .

",
2171,0,," to ensure they are not neglected , parents hoping to home-school must both register the fact they are home-schooling their child and submit to regular , state inspections of the child 's progress .
",
2172,0,," if the child is deemed to be falling behind his age group , the parent may be forced to return the child to a school .
",
2173,0,," the parent should be given standards of teaching that they must adhere to before the inspections occur , and the standards should be sufficiently flexible to reflect children learn at different speeds and that not all children 's development reflects fairly on their teacher .
",
2174,0,," the state constantly fails those with greatest faith needs in schools .
",
2175,0,," there are numerous examples of failure of accommodation : ignorant provision for prayer times , banning of religious dress , unwitting subjection of students to religious festivals that are manifestly unsuitable1 .
",
2176,0,," if parents want to avoid such perils altogether , and teach their child within an environment that caters for their religious need then that is and should be their right .

",

",
2183,0,,"british universities are facing cuts in government funding and as a result there will be no new places created to cater for rising demand .
",
2184,0,," professor steve smith , president of universities uk noted the fact that the budget cuts that could soar to as much as # 950,000,000 over three years would decrease the quality of education whilst keeping the numbers of university places stagnant .
",
2185,0,," in, 160,000 students who applied did not go to university .
",
2186,0,," in, 75,000 more people applied .1 governments in rich countries all over the world are facing squeezed budged over the next few years and will be unable to increase funding for universities .
",
2187,0,," this leaves private universities as the only way to meet increasing demand for higher education .
",
2188,0,," 1shepherd ,in the rest of the economy , when consumers are allowed to choose between goods or services , the higher quality products are successful and the bad ones fail .
",
2189,0,," similarly , when consumers can makes choices between universities , and are putting money on the line , thus taking a risk , they will choose the good universities , and consider the bad universities as not worth wasting their money on .
",
2190,0,," as a consequence , the best universities will expand , and the worst universities will either improve or fail .
",
2191,0,," the new college of the humanities for example is aiming to rival oxford and cambridge1 so helping to provide these two elite institutions with the necessary competition to force up standards .
",
2192,0,," this will result in a higher quality of education being available to more people .
",
2193,0,," privatisation of universities allows for a greater range of educational provision : universities are no longer restrained by government targets and bureaucracy , and are incentivised by possible profits to set themselves apart and provide `` unique selling points '' that will gain them more students : the current system does not provide this motivation because universities receive their funding regardless of student numbers .
",
2194,0,," the majority of people in the uk have not benefited from a university education , and graduates earn more , on average , than the rest of the population .
",
2195,0,," further , universities accept a larger number of richer people than they do poorer people .
",
2196,0,," a national audit office report claims `` socioeconomic background remains a strong determinant of higher education participation .
",
2197,0,," people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds make up around half of the population of england , but represent justper cent of young , full-time , first-time entrants to higher education .
",
2198,0,," ``it is therefore wrong on principle to use tax-payers ' money to subsidise universities , because when universities are subsidised from a general `` pot '' of taxation , a redistribution of wealth occurs whereby the rich benefit at a cost to the poorer people in society .
",
2199,0,," this is wrong , because we should be using taxation to attempt to mitigate economic inequality , not to exacerbate it .
",
2200,1,,"in the age of apparent equality women are increasingly encouraged to ‘have it all’, balancing career, children and marriage in order to be seen as successful.
",

",
2202,1,," others feel that no harm comes to children if the alternative care is good and that children may in fact benefit if paid work makes the mother happier and her work improves the family’s living standards .

2213,1,," many studies point to the years before a child starts school as the most important in its educational and emotional development.
",
2214,1,," for this reason, should the mother be at home, at least until her children start school?
",
2215,1,," or can children develop equally well- or sometimes better- with support from others in addition to their mothers?
",
2216,0,," in the context of this debate, i use the term ‘housemother’ to express a mother who stays at home to look after her children, and ‘housefather’ to mean the same thing in relation to their father.
",
2217,0,,"in many religions and cultures the role of the mother is a sacred one .
",
2218,0,," the bible , specifically in scriptures timothy 5:14 and titus: 4-5 , focuses on women 's role as ` keepers of the house ' , who should bear children and raise them in the way of the lord .
",
2219,0,," in proverbs: 28-31 women as a whole are praised for the successful raising of children and home , and as such this role is valued more than a mother working .
",
2220,0,," in the quran , mothers are regarded highly , e.g. 17:23 , 31:14 , 46:15 .
",
2221,0,," the prophet muhammad even stated that ` paradise lies at the feet of your mother ' .
",
2222,0,," the islamic scholar majmoo ' fatawa wa maqalat mutanawwi'ah explains that within the quran ` she , the mother , is to be given precedence over and above the father ' .
",
2223,0,," yet for a mother to earn this regard , she must stay in the home above all else , and this involves not gaining employment outside the home when caring for children .
",
2224,0,," hindu scriptures similarly often state that one must worship his or her mother first , vanparva313 .60 , apastamba dharmsutra i. 10.28.9 .
",
2225,0,," thus for many religions the role of mother is sacred .
",
2226,0,," this means that the woman should be viewed as privileged and valued as a housemother , a god-given position that is not available to the father .
",
2227,0,," in secular circles as well , often women look after children because in most countries they originally receive more maternity leave than a father does paternity leave1 , or are necessary carers because they provide breast milk .
",
2228,0,," in this case the mother 's choice to look after the child at an early age is merely a practical one , and if during this time a closer bond develops between mother and child , then it seems easier that they should continue to care for the child .
",
2229,0,," the bbc has previously recorded that in the uk childcare options are often unaffordable , and families with two working parents are often not much better off than families with one working parent , october,.
",
2230,0,," there is more recent evidence of this from aviva 's family finances report in, which found ` parents questioning whether they can both afford to work , due to the high cost of childcare.
",
2231,0,," workingmums.net reports a similar situation in the usa , and from anecdotal evidence , such as a number of blogs , it appears this situation is common worldwide .
",
2232,0,," if this is the case , then maybe it is logical for mothers to save on childcare costs and give up their own work .
",
2233,0,," furthermore , it is undeniable that a professional carer who looks after a group of children can not give as much singular attention to one child , or know all the specific whims of each child .
",
2234,0,," psychologist steve biddulphbelieves that this leaves the children desperate for a single adult to shower them with affection , and a denial of this desire can lead to higher levels of aggression by the time they reach primary school .
",
2235,0,," however , a housemother would both be able to give the attention and know the details , and avoid an increase in these levels of aggression .
",
2236,0,," 3 biddulph , ` raising boys : why boys are different - and how to help them become happy and well-balanced men ' mothers who stay at home benefit society as a whole .
",
2237,0,," the money that they save on childcare can be spent in other areas such as pensions , healthcare , or environmental issues .
",
2238,0,," stay at home mothers are more likely to have time to be involved with their community .
",
2239,0,," volunteers are needed in many spheres of education such as ptas , parent-teacher associations , classroom assistants or organisers of school trips and sharing skills , news talk radio ,.
",
2240,0,," however there are many other areas where they can make a difference as they have the time , such as volunteering for charities or community groups and looking after other parents ' children .
",
2241,0,," those mothers who stay home are able to become more fully involved in these aspects of community life in the process making the community a much better place to bring up children .
",
2242,0,," early childhood is the most influential period in a child 's development.
",
2243,0,," it is in this period that a child learns which social rules are to be obeyed and how emotions , such as anger , are expressed .
",
2244,0,," also it is the period of time when ` attachment ' begins , see ` attachment theory ' authors such as donald winnicott or john bowlby , also discussed in ` scrapbook ' below , and many psychologists believe this attachment is essential to normal social and emotional development in the child.
",
2245,0,," therefore the more time the mother spends with the child at this time , the stronger this attachment will be .
",
2246,0,," mothers who stay at home can ensure their children get the best possible start in life .
",
2247,0,," they can help the child learn how to appropriately express emotions , and create a loving bond .
",
2248,0,," this bond will ensure that they know what their children are doing , how to make them happy , and when something is wrong .
",
2249,0,," when the children are older , a housemother is more able to monitor her children 's activities and therefore will know if the children are late home from school or tardy going to school and therefore will be able to notice any problems .
",
2250,0,," housemothers will also be better equipped to take their children to other after school activities or social events .
",
2251,0,," for these reasons , if the mother stays at home when the child is young , she can better ensure that the child has a safer and more varied experience later on in life .

",
2255,1,,"the length of full-time undergraduate degree courses varies from country to country, and may not be standard even within one education system.
",
2256,1,," however, around the world four-year degrees are most common, with five years or more not unknown in countries such as germany and italy.
",
2257,1,," england stands out as the main example of three-year degree courses, although within the uk scottish undergraduate courses are usually four years in length and this is becoming increasingly common elsewhere in the uk.
",
2258,1,," sincethe private university of buckingham in southern england has pioneered two-year undergraduate degrees1, but until recently this had little influence on mainstream higher education in the uk or elsewhere.
",
2259,1,," fromonwards the uk government began to re-examine the way in which university courses were delivered, funding pilot studies for two-year degrees in several universities.
",
2260,1,,"financial pressures on the uk education system have led to a wider debate on whether two-year undergraduate degrees would be better for both students and the taxpayer.
",
2261,1,,"this case presents the arguments for shorter undergraduate degree courses with the uk debate in mind – this would mean a reduction of most undergraduate degrees from three years to two.
",
2262,1,," however, the arguments could equally well apply to other countries, where proposals may be for a decrease from four or five years to three.
",
2263,0,," this may be particularly relevant to continental european universities, as the bologna process2 by which european higher education will be harmonised towards a standard three-year bachelor degree will affect them over the next few years.
",
2264,0,,"universities are now under what is perhaps the most serious financial pressure they have ever faced1 - the uk government for example is cutting spending on education by up to%and allowing universities to charge higher tuition fees .
",
2265,0,," shorter degree courses will help to address these great pressures on all higher education systems .
",
2266,0,," by moving students through university more quickly , they free up capacity so that the increasing demand for higher education can be met within existing resources .
",
2267,0,," and as tuition fees rise in the uk3 and many other countries as a consequence of government funding cuts , students will benefit from shorter courses that will allow them to graduate with less debt .
",
2268,0,," if modern students are not up to the demands of higher education , they should not be going to university in the first place .
",
2269,0,," the over-expansion of higher education in the last twenty years has inevitably lowered standards among undergraduates1 , as well as imposing greater costs on taxpayers .
",
2270,0,," a two year system would undoubtedly be more intensive , and come with considerably less time off than the current system .
",
2271,0,," this would most likely discourage those who see university as simply ` something to do before getting a job ' , thus increasing the value of a degree once more .
",
2272,0,," those who left school atorbut now want to go to college are often more serious about their studies , often with a more motivated and professional approach thanor 20-year-olds who have moved to university by default .
",
2273,0,," we should seek to encourage such committed students , who often contribute a great deal to society and the economy upon their graduation .
",
2274,0,," but mature students want focused , cost-effective courses that do not require them to take three or more years out of a career .
",
2275,0,," for example , at stafford university where 2-year courses are being trialed , director for academic development dr steve wyn williams has said that `` many of our students who opt to do the fast-tracks are mature students who are looking for a career change who are often quite used to working during the summer period when they were in employment ``.
",
2276,0,," it would seem then that the introduction of such courses would encourage more mature students to get better qualifications , and in the process be able to contribute more to the economy as well as learn more for themselves .
",
2277,0,," by teaching students forweeks a year rather than less than, the same amount of teaching time can be provided so that students reach degree standard faster .
",
2278,0,," the university of buckingham has shown over many years that this can be achieved with no loss of quality - they remain highly placed in comparative league tables1 .
",
2279,0,," at the same time laboratories and lecture theatres do not stand empty for half the year , while students still haveweeks of vacation in which they can read and reflect on their learning .
",
2280,1,,"the option to study past societies is present in most school systems, and is often compulsory at primary school and in the early years of secondary school.
",
2281,1,," debate about the teaching of history in schools is particularly prominent and heated in east asia: china and south korea object to modern japanese textbooks, approved by the japanese government, which sometimes omit or marginalize atrocities committed by japanese soldiers in the 1930s and 1940s.
",
2282,1,," the approval of such textbooks prompted violent anti-japanese demonstrations in several chinese cities in april 2005.
",
2283,1,," however, the issue is of broader significance: arguably all historical writing is coloured by the conscious and subconscious prejudices and preoccupations of its authors.
",
2284,1,," this assesses the extent of these influences, but also calls for consideration of whether the benefits of historical study outweigh any drawbacks that may result from such bias.
",
2285,1,,"corporal punishment is a physical punishment in which pain is deliberately inflicted on a perpetrator of a wrong in order to exact retribution and to deter similar behavior in future.
",
2286,1,," an accepted form of discipline through the ages, it has been upheld by all the abrahamic religions, and has been practiced in some form in almost every human civilization.
",
2287,1,," corporal punishment was for a long time considered an appropriate method for disciplining children in schools.
",
2288,1,," the birch rod was once a fixture of the schoolhouse.
",
2289,1,," in the latter half of the 20th century, however, a growing number of states have outlawed the use of corporal punishment, particularly in schools.
",
2290,1,," corporal punishment in schools is now illegal in all european countries, except for france and czech republic.
",
2291,1,," corporal punishment is practiced in schools across the world, includingstates of the usa.
",
2292,1,," proponents of corporal punishment need to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as a tool of discipline.
",
2293,1,," opponents on the other hand highlight the costs both physical and mental inherent in the punishment.
",
2294,1,,"the kind of punishment used can vary considerably both in terms of the severity and were is being hit with what as well as in what context.
",
2295,1,," a traditional case is the implementation of a ""school disciplinarian"" who performs the actual punishment so as to avoid excesses or misapplications by individual teachers not versed in such methods.
",
2296,1,," likewise, having a separate disciplinarian means teachers too physically weak or timid to mete out the punishment themselves, have recourse to an external arbiter that does not look like an abrogation of responsibility, and thus weakness, in the eyes of the class1.
",
2297,1,," strict regulation of the extent of acceptable punishment is also important to consider when proposing such a disciplinary regime.1bloom, scott.

",
2302,1,,"universities provide higher education to people who have completed school and most also act as centres for academic study.
",
2303,1,," some universities will specialise in a small number of subjects, while the largest can cover almost every field.
",
2304,1,," university education covers both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.
",
2305,1,," the definition of exactly which institutions do and do not have degree-awarding powers varies between countries.
",
2306,1,,"for the purposes of this debate, we will be looking particularly at discouraging non-vocational courses – those which are not directly required for any career.
",
2307,1,," this would include degrees such as mathematics or history, and exclude those like medicine.
",
2308,1,," (note that some subjects, such as law and chemical engineering, have both academic and vocational aspects.)
",
2309,1,," we will imagine a policy along the following lines: cut the amount of funding given to universities by the government, shape the funding criteria to prioritise academia and put the rest of the money into different kinds of vocational training – for example, the university technical colleges being set up in liverpool, uk.
",
2310,1,,"in many western countries, a large proportion of students who leave school go to university.
",
2311,1,," in the usa, the proportion is typically around 50%, while the uk is slowly increasing from 40%.
",
2312,1,," the long-term trend has been that proportions of people going to university increases – in the uk, this has gone from around 5,000 in 1920, to 100,000 into 350,000 in 2011.
",
2313,1,,"university education is the highest level of education which is still reasonably common, and so graduates have a certain status and respect.
",
2314,1,," they produce specialists in many fields, particularly in science-related careers.
",
2315,1,," this makes them a source of social mobility, as people who leave with a good degree are able to break into well-paid careers.
",
2316,1,," as well as this, the fact that they are melting pots for people from multiple backgrounds – and often multiple countries – gives young people what may be their first serious exposure to people who are different from them, and this contributes to tolerance.
",
2317,1,,"however, with the increase in the proportion of young people going to university, degrees are suffering from “inflation,” where they are too common to hold their value.
",
2318,1,," increasingly, recruiters are looking for skills rather than knowledge, and many companies complain that graduates are not leaving properly prepared for work.
",
2319,1,," as well as being bad for employers, this means that many students are – at least to an extent – wasting their time.
",
2320,0,," not everyone should be spending their time in academic study .
",
2321,0,," as well as requiring certain skills , it also requires that the personality of the student be suited to it .
",
2322,0,," they must be capable of manufacturing a sustained interest in a subject , or they will not be able to drag themselves through three or more years of thinking about little else .
",
2323,0,," some people are , by nature , not that kind of person -- they may think in a short-term way or simply not be curious about the world .
",
2324,0,," it also requires a level of intelligence which some people simply do n't have .
",
2325,0,," these people will gain very little from spending time at university .
",
2326,0,," in fact , at some , typically less prestigious , universities , dropout rates can be as high as% , meaning students will literally gain nothing .
",
2327,0,," many people are putting themselves through university despite it not being right for them .
",
2328,0,," partial blame for this lies with employers -- the large number of graduates means a culture has developed among recruiters of using the presence or absence of a degree as a default filter for applicants ;% of leading employers filter out anyone with less than a 2:1 .
",
2329,0,," we should discourage this .
",
2330,0,," by implementing this policy , we create a different and better way to measure someone 's employability .
",
2331,0,," this will make employers more likely to hire these people , and allow them to follow a path through life better suited to their personality .
",
2332,0,," the courses which are generally offered at the moment are not serving students well when it comes to providing the skills for employment .
",
2333,0,," 65 % of businesses complain of being unable to hire people with the right skills .
",
2334,0,," increasingly , universities are offering as a selling point the fact that they have extra-curricular courses to teach people business skills , but this is a tacit admission that they are selling people degrees which are not fit for purpose .
",
2335,0,," solving this requires us to teach more vocationally .
",
2336,0,," there are schemes underway in many areas to do just that -- to give one example , in maine , usa , a bill has been passed to improve local colleges .
",
2337,0,," our policy moves these efforts from the fringes to the core of the system : isolate as far as possible the specific things which make good employees and teach those to people .
",
2338,0,," this will help them get jobs more easily , and also ensure that companies are able to operate effectively .
",
2339,0,," the consequences of such a policy would be good all round .
",
2340,0,," universities can not take every student who applies .
",
2341,0,," they have to balance the number of applications they get with both the number of teaching staff they have and the time they need for research .
",
2342,0,," in the uk , almost a third of applicants do not get places as it is , and those that do often find they have less contact time with staff than they had expected .
",
2343,0,," simply put , if you want to have academics doing useful research , you ca n't expect them to teach all the time .
",
2344,0,," if universities have a finite number of places , it makes sense that they should be allocated to the people best suited for them .
",
2345,0,," currently , universities are so overwhelmed by demand that it is n't possible for them to test this properly -- in most cases , they will take a cursory look at predicted grades , and perhaps an interview with the candidate .
",
2346,0,," discouraging applicants would lower the stress on admissions departments , making the process more accurate .
",
2347,0,," it will also allow them more leisure to reach out to and target students with the right personality , improving the quality of applications .
",
2348,0,," forget all of the discussion as to whether or not academic courses are useful -- it 's simply not practical to have everyone do them .
",
2349,0,," the best academic departments are ones run with purely academic aims .
",
2350,0,," intensive study of a field requires that you are given the resources , support , time and space that you need .
",
2351,0,," moreover , the best atmosphere is one in which everyone around you shares your love of study .
",
2352,0,," it follows that departments should be allowed to use this as their top priority .
",
2353,0,," this affects undergraduate study in two ways : students must be free to spend time getting to grips with their subject properly , and lecturers must be allowed to teach the things they feel to be most important for their subject .
",
2354,0,," neither of these things are possible when you are worrying about jobs .
",
2355,0,," every subject has certain parts which are more or less relevant to their related careers , but this may not be the same as the parts which are important to academic study of the subject .
",
2356,0,," for example , maths students will invariably be taught linear algebra and group theory , normally in the first year , but% of mathematics graduates work in business & finance , where this is not relevant .
",
2357,0,," if everyone is expected to have one eye on vocational training the academic study will necessarily suffer .
",
2358,0,," solving this problem requires that we split vocational and academic study , so that people doing one do n't need to worry about the other .
",
2359,0,," this will improve each of them .
",
2360,1,,"most major educational systems utilize some sort of standardized test for university admissions.
",
2361,1,," the importance of these tests varies between countries.
",
2362,1,," a-level results almost solely determine university admission in the united kingdom, while results of the american sat test, while important, tend to be less valued than secondary school grade point averages (gpa) and supplementary activities and involvement.
",
2363,1,,"the sat has an interesting history.
",
2364,1,,"  it was first introduced in the 1930s in an effort to reduce socio-economic discrimination in admissions.
",
2365,1,," the then president of harvard university, james bryan conant, having discovered that a number of seemingly qualified working-class applicants were being rejected in favour of less qualified students from wealthier background, pushed for the introduction of aptitude tests for undergraduate admissions.
",
2366,1,," this then provided an objective measurement against which the behaviour of the admissions office could be measured.
",
2367,1,,"conant’s campaign was eventually successful, with nearly every institution in the united states adopting either the sat or the act test for admissions.
",
2368,1,," ironically however, the sat subsequently came under attack for discriminating against the very groups conant wished to help.
",
2369,1,,"a number of studies have shown that low-income and minority students perform far less well on low-income and minority students perform far less well on the exam than white or affluent students.
",
2370,1,,"  a diminished effect is noticeable on racial lines even when the data is corrected for income.
",
2371,1,,"furthermore, the importance of the sat has led to the growth of a large industry dedicated to providing tutoring and test preparation services to prospective test-takers.
",
2372,1,," the fact that many american students will pay thousands of dollars on test preparation can be seen as evidence that the test favours the wealthy.
",
2373,1,,"these criticisms have become more pressing as a number of countries as well as us states have introduced similar tests for graduation from secondary school.
",
2374,1,," in addition to the above criticisms it has also been suggested that they encourage schools to “teach to the test” rather than focus on the installation of pure knowledge.
",
2375,1,,"as a consequence of these criticisms a number of institutions, such as smith college and wake forest university, have abandoned sats wholesale in their admissions, or made the tests optional.
",
2376,0,," standardized tests are inherently arbitrary .
",
2377,0,," they reduce an applicant 's entire academic career to a single one-day session .
",
2378,0,," the result is an inherently unrepresentative test which fails to paint an accurate picture .
",
2379,0,," what if a student has a bad day ?
",
2380,0,," what if they do poorly on the specific test questions ?
",
2381,0,," in the sat 's there is an error of measurement of aboutpoints either way out of, this is the potential difference between where the student really is and what his or her score on the day was .
",
2382,0,," by contrast , looking at their entire academic record ensures that admissions officers will get a far more comprehensive picture of their actual ability .
",
2383,0,," the law of averages means that bad days and tests will be balanced out with good ones , with the result that their academic record , the result of years of work , will reflect their true performance .
",
2384,0,," standardized tests are inherently skewed in favour of high-income students .
",
2385,0,," tutoring is and industry unto itself and the resulting rise in scores among high income students skews the scale against students whose families can not afford it .
",
2386,0,," by contrast , even if the money is available , the impact that tutoring can have on a student 's academic performance is limited .
",
2387,0,," a tutor can not write papers or take tests for them , and nor can they answer questions in class , or participate in sports or other extracurricular activities .
",
2388,0,," as a consequence , eliminating easily tutored standardized tests helps even the playing field between richer and poorer students .
",
2389,0,," minority students perform less well on tests like the sat , even when correction is made for income .
",
2390,0,," the test with its reading comprehension test and being done in english is obviously biased against students from households where english is not the dominant language as they are much less likely to understand the questions .
",
2391,0,," even when english language skills are not a problem the question choice can contain a cultural bias .
",
2392,0,," one analogy question on thesat used the word `` regatta '' which minority students were unlikely to be familiar with .
",
2393,0,," having this kind of bias is obviously unfair and can never be fully accounted for in a diverse country such as the united states of america where those who set the wording of the questions will never know all possible perspectives .
",
2394,0,," most tests were designed in an earlier era when far fewer students took them .
",
2395,0,," the large number of students who now take tests like the sats results in a situation in which the scoring scale magnifies small differences in performance into large differences in scores .
",
2396,0,," two questions wrong out ofon the math section of the sat may well produce a score ofwhile three questions wrong will result in a. 40 points can mean difference between admission and rejection for many candidates , while telling us nothing about the different abilities of the students involved .
",
2397,0,," indeed on average for% of applicants their sat score will predict their final college grade rank no more accurately than a pair of dice .
",
2398,0,," the importance attached to such tests leads to teachers actively `` teaching the test . ''
",
2399,0,," the result is that many teachers , rather than instilling useful skills or providing a balanced curriculum , end up trying to focus on things that occur on given tests .
",
2400,0,," while this is not a huge problem with the sat itself , it is a serious problem with subject tests like the sat 2s , ap exams , and the british a-levels .
",
2401,0,," this undermines the provision of education in the country .
",
2402,1,,"reformers argue that the school calendar used in countries round the world is outdated and inefficient.
",
2403,1,," the current system, which usually consists of two or three school terms punctuated by long holiday periods, stands accused of doing little to equip schoolchildren for later life, wasting time repeating material after long vacations in which much of the previous year’s lessons have been forgotten, and using school resources inefficiently.
",
2404,1,,"much better, they say, to introduce year-round schooling, in which shorter blocks of learning time are interspersed with more frequent but brief holidays (for exampledays of school followed bydays of holiday).
",
2405,1,," however, others say that the present timetable is fine, and that any change will just cause needless upheaval without dealing with the true reasons for educational underachievement.
",
2406,1,,"so should countries move to year-round schooling?
",
2407,0,," studies show that students in year-round schooling tend to get perform better on many assessment metrics than those who do not .
",
2408,0,," schools operating a year-round calendar do not have to cram so much course content into amonth schedule , but can space out learning better .
",
2409,0,," this allows teaching to proceed at a more logical pace , helping students learn better .
",
2410,0,," furthermore , by giving students frequent short breaks , instead of two or three long ones , pupils are refreshed and ready to learn when school resumes .
",
2411,0,," during long summer holidays , students completely put aside learning and forget all about their studies for up to three months .
",
2412,0,," in this time , they inevitably forget quite a lot of what they have learned .
",
2413,0,," teachers then have to spend the first weeks of the new academic year bringing them back up to speed .
",
2414,0,," by eliminating the long summer break and replacing it with year-round learning punctuated by shorter vacation times , this problem would be much reduced .
",
2415,0,," the structure of the school year is often one of the few fixed points in young people 's lives .
",
2416,0,," for many children , particularly those from poorer families , long summer holidays do n't mean summer camps and foreign holidays , but day after day sitting in front of the tv or hanging around in their neighbourhood .
",
2417,0,," all the evidence suggests that boredom is a major factor behind social problems like drug use , youth crime and antisocial behaviour .
",
2418,0,," year-round schooling would not get rid of problems like these , of course , but it might help to reduce the level of such behaviour by giving young people something to do .
",
2419,0,," for many parents , particularly those with more than one child , summer vacations can be a stressful and difficult time .
",
2420,0,," without the structure provided by school attendance , children become bored easily and parents struggle to cope .
",
2421,0,," this is especially true for mothers who may be bringing up children without a father present , or those who wish to continue or resume their careers after the first few years of motherhood ; trying to combine a full-time job with the rigours of motherhood is hard but trying to do so during a three month school holiday is almost impossible .
",
2422,0,," year-round schooling makes such a work-life balance easier for young parents and allows women to return to the workplace on their own terms .
",
2423,0,," evidence suggests that children from lower-income families tend to `` fall behind '' further during long summer vacations .
",
2424,0,," these children are less likely to read books , pursue additional studies or take part in useful extracurricular activities compared to their peers from wealthier families .
",
2425,0,," this has a knock-on effect on their academic achievement , and once they have fallen behind it is very difficult for them to catch up .
",
2426,0,," , this is the logic behind government-funded programs such as head start in the us or sure start in the uk , year-round schooling would remove this important driver of inequality , give students a level playing field on which to learn , and help create a more meritocratic society .
",
2427,0,," a nation 's most important resource is its human capital , and in the modern world it is vital to have a skilled , educated workforce in order to remain competitive .
",
2428,0,," many nations have already adopted year-round schooling .
",
2429,0,," by following their example , we will be giving our young people an important advantage in the employment market and thereby improving the country 's economic prospects .
",
2430,0,," year-round schooling often goes hand in hand with multi-tracking , where different groups of students at the same school are on different schedules .
",
2431,0,," this has the advantage of allowing school rooms , facilities and other resources to be used more efficiently , thus providing a better education without putting even more strain on government budgets .
",
2432,1,,"nearly all secondary school students (from age eleven) in eu countries are obliged to study at least one modern foreign language up to their final year.
",
2433,1,," many students study two.
",
2434,1,," some start learning foreign languages at primary level and, by school leaving age, no longer consider the languages they have acquired as “foreign”.
",
2435,1,," italy, the republic of ireland and the uk are the exceptions where learning a foreign language in school is not compulsory.
",
2436,1,," outside of europe, less than half american high school students learn foreign languages  despite 91% of secondary schools offering a foreign language as a part of the curriculum.
",
2437,1,," this however does not seem to be affecting the popularity of foreign languages at the tertiary level with enrolments for arabic growing by 46% betweenand 2009.
",
2438,1,," by contrast, approximatelymillion students learn english in china, but only 24,000 us pupils make the effort to learn chinese languages.
",
2439,1,,"the english speaking world seems to believe it need not learn foreign languages as most foreigners display competence in english.
",
2440,1,," foreign language learning in british schools ceased to be compulsory inand in 2010, only 44% of british gcse (general certificate of secondary education) students (up toyears) studied a language.
",
2441,1,,"in august 2010, the national assembly of wales announced its plan to spend £4 million on welsh language training and welsh speaking schools are prevalent in wales.
",
2442,1,," all students in the republic of ireland study both english and irish, and some gaelic language schools are still in action in scotland.
",
2443,1,," however, despite being given a platform to avoid language death, these minority languages in the british isles are not considered “foreign” and their presence does not encourage nor empower the students in the uk and ireland to learn yet more languages.
",
2444,1,,"the question therefore is whether learning foreign languages should remain compulsory for all school students up to the age of 16.
",
2445,0,," a high number of students failing to succeed in languages is not a valid reason to make the subject optional .
",
2446,0,," this mentality opens the gate to making english and math options , simply to eradicate the effort of improving pass rates .
",
2447,0,," the british broadcasting corporation , bbc , reports that in the uk `` a quarter of secondary pupils , agedand over , fail to reach their potential in math , s , and a quarter are making insufficient progress in english '' .
",
2448,0,," still , optional english and math is unthinkable ; these are core subjects - languages should also be considered as such .
",
2449,0,," those who want to transfer students energies from foreign languages to english are ignoring the possibility that learning a foreign language may actually be useful for learning the first language .
",
2450,0,," students failing in core subjects must be helped to improve , not have the subject eradicated .
",
2451,0,," languages are extremely beneficial to the economy in two senses .
",
2452,0,," firstly , language skills improve a job candidate 's chances of selection , which keeps unemployment down .
",
2453,0,," the national centre for languages , cilt , reports on its website that ``% of employers recruit people with languages '' , ``% of employers are dissatisfied with school leavers ' language skills '' and that ``% of london employers think that language skills are important for the london economy '' .
",
2454,0,," secondly , a high number of employees with language skills enhance companies ' abilities to engage in trade and to expand their business abroad , in turn enhancing exports .
",
2455,0,," the call for students to learn a foreign language not only stems from economic needs but also from the need of improved security and diplomacy , in particular a better understanding of cultures and languages in order to better understand threats to the state and improved foreign services are needed .
",
2456,0,," in many anglophone countries even in the role of a diplomat there are worrying numbers who do not have the language skills they need , for example in canada `` only% of theforeign service officers who were required to have advanced foreign languages skills for their positions , could speak the needed language . ''
",
2457,0,," as anational academy of sciences report warns us `` the pervasive lack of knowledge of foreign languages and cultures threatens the security of the united states as well as its ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an unformed citizenry '' .
",
2458,0,," since the increased security post 9/11 the government accountability office , gao , have reported that there are a shortage of foreign language expertise within the government and for this reason may undermine national security .
",
2459,0,," much of the population of mainland europe go to great lengths to learn foreign languages , especially the dominant english .
",
2460,0,," english speakers should reciprocate the efforts made by their foreign counterparts ; nicolas sarkozy for example is aiming to make france into a bilingual nation .
",
2461,0,," across europe at least% of third-level students claim to be proficient in at least two foreign languages .
",
2462,0,," however , in countries where english is a major language , this is not the case ; in ireland , for example the figure is only% .
",
2463,0,," in the united states the situation is similar only% of us elementary schools and% of public schools teach foreign languages .
",
2464,0,," expecting foreign countries to communicate through dominant english is a lazy and arrogant attitude to language and should not be permitted .
",
2465,0,," therefore learning languages up to the age of sixteen should be compulsory .
",
2466,0,," the problems students face when learning languages are the fault of teaching methods , not language ability .
",
2467,0,," madeline ehrman observes that the root of this problem is that the `` student is `` out of sync '' with the methodology , the teacher . ''
",
2468,0,," therefore , the antidote is more modern learning styles ; `` there are some quick fixes that can be made when adaptations are needed '' .
",
2469,0,," languages should not be abandoned when students find them boring rather the curriculum and methods of teaching need to be changed to make the learning more interesting and more relevant .
",
2470,0,," for example students struggle even with their own grammar so an emphasis on making themselves understood rather than correct grammar may be more useful .
",
2471,0,," to refuse to learn foreign languages is narrow-minded , ignorant and blinkered .
",
2472,0,," language is a means not only of asserting identity but , more importantly of `` heritage culture maintenance '' .
",
2473,0,," to refuse to learn a foreign language is to disallow anyone 's culture apart from one 's own to be upheld .
",
2474,0,," when this happens , `` the dominant groups force ethnic groups into particular ... niches '' .
",
2475,0,," this is particularly likely to be a problem in multicultural societies or indeed any society that is not homogeneous .
",
2476,0,," by refusing to learn foreign languages , one refuses to recognise that other cultures even exist .
",
2477,0,," for this reason learning a foreign language helps to tackle xenophobia .
",
2478,0,," negative stereotyping is sadly still prevalent in the modern world .
",
2479,0,," `` american students in maine view persons speaking standard french as shorter , less leaderlike , sic , less thoughtful , less intelligent , less honest , less self-confident , less dependable , less generous , less kind , less ambitious , less stable and with less character than english speakers '' .
",
2480,0,," such stereotypes lead to prejudices , xenophobia and , in extreme cases , hate crime .
",
2481,0,," learning foreign languages is a good way to combat such prejudices , because the students learn about the foreign culture for themselves , meet and converse with its people , and have a first-hand introduction to a foreign people .
",
2482,0,," this will leave them more open minded towards other cultures so less likely to be xenophobic towards other cultures whose language they have not learnt .
",
2483,0,," as reynolds explains , `` discounting stereotypes involves denying cultural differences '' such as the ability to communicate through the same language .
",
2484,0,," students should have a fundamental freedom of choice when it comes to all but the most necessary subjects .
",
2485,0,," if students want to specialise in for example science and drop foreign languages in order to be able to do this then they should have this option , a choice which is likely to be beneficial for their chosen career .
",
2486,0,," students ' progress in their most successful subjects should not be hindered by the burden of language learning .
",
2487,0,," it is not the case that students do not desire to engage in languages because they are lazy , narrow-minded or blinkered .
",
2488,0,," rather , because they demonstrate real strength in other subjects they do not wish to be constrained in those subjects by ones where they do not excel .
",
2489,0,," a standard complaint is quoted by ehrman ; `` , learning languages , affects , all study , a lot !
",
2490,0,," i 'm finding it just depressing to have to study , when my only reason for being here is to meet a requirement ... it really annoys me to have to waste my time on this , when i could be learning something i 'll use after graduation ... the pressure 's just too much for me ! ''
",
2491,0,," students should be allowed and encouraged to channel all their energy and enthusiasm into the subjects they are best at and most enthusiastic towards .
",
2492,1,,"latin and ancient greek were once considered central to an academic education in many countries.
",
2493,1,," latin was the language of much academic discussion until the eighteenth century; it was used since it could be understood by all “educated” people.
",
2494,1,," latin remains the formal language of the roman catholic church, and therefore the official language of the vatican; it is not, however, used in everyday business.
",
2495,1,," modern ancient greek evolved from ancient greek, but the differences between them are very substantial.
",
2496,1,," the official language of greece was an archaic form of the language, closer to ancient greek, until 1976.
",
2497,1,," it was then replaced with the modern ancient greek of everyday speech.
",
2498,1,,"during the second half of the twentieth century, latin and ancient greek were marginalized in many school curricula: they are now rarely compulsory and most pupils do not have the opportunity to study them, especially outside the independent sector.
",
2499,1,," however, classical languages are compulsory in some italian state-run schools intended for those aiming for a very high level of education: latin is compulsory in the liceo scientifico and both latin and ancient greek are compulsory in the liceo classico.
",
2500,1,," in the uk, the aqa examination board stopped offering examinations in latin and ancient greek in 2006, although the ocr board is continuing to offer examinations in these subjects.
",
2501,1,,"where latin and ancient greek are taught in schools, the curriculum usually has two components, translation and interpretation.
",
2502,1,," translation involves learning the grammar and vocabulary of the languages, in order to translate written passages into one’s own native language.
",
2503,1,," sometimes, pupils are also required to translate into latin and ancient greek; this requires a very high level of grammatical knowledge.
",
2504,1,," interpretation involves the critical study of excerpts from classical literature, usually in the original languages.
",
2505,1,," courses sometimes include an element of historical study of ancient greece or rome.
",
2506,1,," since latin and ancient greek are no longer in everyday spoken use, pupils are not usually taught how to speak these languages, or how to understand others doing so.
",
2507,1,,"one suggested model for teaching the classics, at least in the uk, would be for all students to learn classics from the start of secondary school, but have the option to drop it voluntarily at a later stage, such as school year(age 13) when students usually choose which subjects they will do their gcse’s in, in favour of continuing a separate language.
",
2508,1,," they would be tested solely on their reading comprehension in relation to the classic texts.
",
2509,0,," even if all subjects must show practical economic utility , the study of classics is still justifiable .
",
2510,0,," translation of latin and ancient greek teaches concentration , attention to detail and logical thought .
",
2511,0,," debates about the interpretation of classical literature develop the ability to think critically and to construct reasoned arguments .
",
2512,0,," familiarity with classical literature improves the ability to write clearly , concisely and eloquently .
",
2513,0,," these are all skills valued by employers ; people who have studied classics have reached the top of politics , commerce , diplomacy and law .
",
2514,0,," classics are useful for understanding the etymology , the study of the origins and development of words , of english words .
",
2515,0,," italian , french , spanish , portuguese and romanian , the romance languages , are derived from latin : knowledge of latin vocabulary greatly eases the learning of these languages .
",
2516,0,," much modern language teaching emphasises conversational skills rather than grammatical rules ; classical language teaching is usually based upon grammar , rather than conversation .
",
2517,0,," pupils therefore develop a clear understanding of how languages work by studying classical languages ; this can be applied to the study of both their own language and modern foreign languages .
",
2518,0,," learning classical languages gives pleasure to many who study them , since they are satisfying intellectual challenges .
",
2519,0,," a substantial proportion of those who are given the opportunity to study latin and/or ancient greek at school continue this study at university .
",
2520,0,," societies should not be obsessed with balance sheets and vocational skills , but should seek to provide cultural enrichment to their citizens .
",
2521,0,," it is wrong that the opportunity for such cultural enrichment through classical languages if often only available to those whose parents can afford private education .
",
2522,0,," the influence of classical texts upon subsequent writing and thought makes knowledge of latin and ancient greek necessary for many areas of intellectual enquiry .
",
2523,0,," european literature bristles with classical allusions : the work of dante , shakespeare , milton , goethe and countless others can not be fully appreciated without close familiarity with the canon of classical writing .
",
2524,0,," since latin was the language of academic discussion until the eighteenth century , it is of great importance for the study of history and theology .
",
2525,0,," the teaching of classical languages at school enables people to pursue studies in these areas in later life .
",
2526,1,,"one of the most contentious social issues in most countries is that of education.
",
2527,1,," in education, people see a clear route to a better life for their children.
",
2528,1,," most people regard some level of education as a right; the degree of education to which we are entitled by right varies from country to country.
",
2529,1,," in britain, the state provides a free education, for all children, from age 5-18.
",
2530,1,," the aim is to produce a comprehensive and high-quality education for all its citizens.
",
2531,1,," however, if a degree is then pursued, it must be undertaken at the student’s expense.
",
2532,1,," this education system is supplemented in britain by independent, fee-paying schools to which parents can send their children if they can afford it.
",
2533,1,," there is an added confusion when talking about private schools in britain, as they are often referred to as ‘public schools’.
",
2534,1,," in australia one in three students attends private schools (econrsss), a large growth from the one in five that attended private schools in the 1970’s.
",
2535,1,," some of the reasons given for this shift include government funding policy and regulations, the strategic marketing decisions of private schools, and the relative quality of government schools (econrsss).
",
2536,1,," which illustrates the relationship between private and state schools is affected by a variety of situations.
",
2537,1,," in india children’s education is compulsory up to the age of 14.
",
2538,1,," the government fund 80% of the schools in india, and only 27% of its population attend private school.
",
2539,1,," yet according to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a fraction of the unit cost of government schools (gprg.org).
",
2540,1,,"  the british model raises many questions, not just pertaining to itself, but to more general issues as well: do you have a right to an education?
",
2541,1,," to what sort of education are you entitled?
",
2542,0,," if parents wish to send their children to a private school, should they have the right so to do?
",
2543,0,,"people should be allowed to spend their money as they wish .
",
2544,0,," if parents choose to spend money on their children 's advancement over something else they could buy then it is there decision to make .
",
2545,0,," the core of this is the idea of ownership over our income , and that the state should not be able to restrict our spending this income by banning products such as private education .
",
2546,0,," education in germany can be used as an example of allowing parents the free will to decide where their child goes to school , articleparagraphsof the grundgesetz enshrines the right to create private schools .
",
2547,0,," , the grundgesetz .
",
2548,0,," there are many other similar cases where the state provides a service but there are also private options , healthcare being the most obvious .
",
2549,0,," while most people in britain use a national health service , nhs , hospital there are other options provided privately by companies such as bupa , no one proposes that people should not be able to buy better healthcare , quite the opposite - the nhs may be moving towards privatization .
",
2550,0,," , mccabe and kirkpatrick  the state funds the education system through taxation .
",
2551,0,," parents who do not send their children to state schools still pay those same taxes .
",
2552,0,," therefore , these taxes are spent on a smaller number of schools and there is more money per child in the state sector than there would be if we banned private education .
",
2553,0,," inthere were 569,080 students in independent schools in england , bbc, - this would be a very large extra burden for state schools to bear .
",
2554,0,," these students ' parents are therefore not only paying for their own children but also for students to study at state schools as well .
",
2555,0,," in, time the us magazine discovered that private schools in the us received much higher sat scores that the state counterparts .
",
2556,0,," research suggests that private education puts a greater emphasis on critical thinking , while state schools emphasise memory and learning by rote , time.com .
",
2557,0,," these types of critical skills mean that students from private schools have a better start at university education as they are more used to what will be required of them .
",
2558,0,," furthermore , students from private schools are more likely to get into a university in the first place , time ,/ bbc  .
",
2559,0,," in the us students are twice as likely to get the grades allowing them to go to university if they have had a private education , and for minority groups in america it is more than double , capenet.org  .
",
2560,0,," this is likely to be replicated across the world .
",
2561,0,," private schools in brazil also provide better education , as there is one teacher perstudents in comparison to the 45-50 students per class in a government funded school .
",
2562,0,," , cabra ; and throssell.
",
2563,0,," therefore by denying private education the effect may be disastrous for these minority groups .
",
2564,1,,"social networking websites like facebook and twitter are breaking down barriers between teachers and students, redefining the way they communicate and interact with each other.
",
2565,1,," both current and former students ‘friend’ their teachers on such websites, which often contain a lot of information on the private lives of both parties.
",
2566,1,," some educators have found such sites to be an excellent tool to reach out to students who might otherwise have difficulty speaking out in class or asking for help.
",
2567,1,," however, parent groups, school administrators, and legislators have become concerned that unsupervised online contacts might lead to inappropriate relationships between students and their teachers, and even sexual abuse.
",
2568,1,," a slew of sexual relationships between students and teachers led the state of missouri to pass a so-called ‘facebook law’ against student-teacher interactions through social media and text messaging.
",
2569,0,," citing free speech, the law was successfully challenged by teachers unions as unconstitutional.
",
2570,0,,"according to carol shakeshaft an expert in sexual misconduct by teachers : `` , e , ducators who use social media for personal and intimate conversations and contact are not much different from those who spend their time hanging out with students at the beach .
",
2571,0,," you have to ask why a teacher would do this .
",
2572,0,," the honest answer is that it rarely has anything to do with student learning . ''
",
2573,0,," interacting with one 's teachers the same way as with one 's friends , sharing personal information , can only erode the respect and distance that a teacher needs in order to be an authority figure and a mentor for her young charges .
",
2574,0,," even if such ` friendships ' were entirely innocent , they would still cast enough suspicion on the teacher-student relationship to put considerable strain on the teacher 's role as educator and their ability to do the job .
",
2575,0,," social networking websites have proven to be particularly effective for child grooming by pedophiles .
",
2576,0,," teachers are already in a position of power and trust in the relationship with their students .
",
2577,0,," being allowed to communicate with students via facebook would greatly facilitate misconduct by a teacher who wants to start an inappropriate relationship with a student , by giving him virtually unlimited access to the students after school .
",
2578,0,," in fact , many such relationships do involve some form of electronic contact1 .
",
2579,0,," by banning this form of communication , the law would make it harder for teachers with bad intentions to carry them through .
",
2580,0,," it is very difficult for a child to realize that he is being groomed ; they are unlikely to know the risk1 .
",
2581,0,," after all , a teacher is regarded as a trusted adult .
",
2582,0,," but , if the child is aware that private electronic contact between teachers and students is prohibited by law , the child will immediately know the teacher is doing something he is not supposed to if he initiates private electronic contact .
",
2583,0,," this will therefore act as an effective warning sign to the child and might prompt the child to tell a parent or another adult about what is going on .
",
2584,0,," access to a teacher 's private information and photos may lead to weakening her position as an educator .
",
2585,0,," how can a teacher convincingly speak against smoking or substance abuse if students have access to pictures portraying the teacher themselves drinking or smoking ?
",
2586,0,," for example , a principal from the bronx , who had been trying to impose a strict dress code at her school , was branded a ` hypocrite ' by her students when a risqué photo of her was found on her facebook page .
",
2587,0,," and even if the teacher will be careful not to post anything inappropriate on her page , a friend or acquaintance might thereby undermining the teacher .
",
2588,0,," a strict separation of personal and professional life would prevent such incidents from happening .
",
2589,1,,"the universities of oxford and cambridge, sometimes known collectively as ‘oxbridge,’ have for many centuries been seen as the pinnacle of higher education, both within britain and across the globe.
",
2590,1,," yet for the eleven or so centuries they have been in existence, many claim, oxford and cambridge have been marked by exclusiveness as well as academic proficiency, with their high entry requirements and old-fashioned practices still favouring those from more privileged backgrounds and excluding, intentionally or otherwise, promising individuals from marginalised areas and difficult backgrounds.
",
2591,1,,"both universities demand that most candidates sit a series of two and three-day interviews, often accompanied by entrance examinations.
",
2592,1,," although demands have been placed on oxford and cambridge by previous british governments to admit higher numbers of students from poorer backgrounds, there is no doubt they are still made up largely of students from independent schools.
",
2593,1,,"oxbridge admissions tests often valorise a form of self confidence and an approach to acquiring knowledge that most state-school pupils aren’t coached in.
",
2594,1,," private schools, however, devote far more resources to preparing their pupils for the two universities’ entry systems.
",
2595,1,," many spend years gearing children up for the interview process, and so often produce people who can shine in the interview scenario, but aren’t necessarily the country’s brightest or those who have worked hardest.
",
2596,1,," it is often argued that 17-year-olds from comprehensives will rarely have had the same intensive training, and so the admissions process inevitably excludes many of the brightest but least well-off pupils.
",
2597,1,,"many from oxbridge go into high-powered jobs in politics, the media and the private sector, leading reformists to argue that the most influential circles of society remain the preserve of the wealthiest, yet not necessarily the most intelligent or able.
",
2598,1,," owen jones, the prominent blogger and polemicist, claims that merely carrying the ‘oxbridge’ stamp means candidates are assumed to be more intelligent than non-oxbridge counterparts.
",
2599,1,," therefore students from oxbridge are given priority in the market for jobs.
",
2600,1,," there is much to suggest that this diminishes the status comparatively of degrees gained by graduates at lower-ranking universities, and a result keeps them out of the best industries.
",
2601,1,," in academic fields, it has also been argued that oxbridge imposes a monopoly on knowledge, stultifying debate and harbouring an innate conservatism which means that research from ‘lesser’ universities are not given the same attention or weighting – a point which will be explored further in the substantive arguments below.
",
2602,1,,"  ‘reform’ in this context means the model proposed by owen jones.
",
2603,1,," the university buildings would be maintained, but many of oxbridge’s more arcane practices would be forcibly abolished.
",
2604,1,," interviews of the type that the university has previously conducted would be allowed only for courses like medicine, in-keeping with the practices of many other universities.
",
2605,1,,"quotas for pupils from state schools would be enforced as opposed to just recommended, with the universities required to reserve 80% of their places for the brightest state-school pupils.
",
2606,1,," this would be much closer to the proportion of private vs. state schooled pupils as state-educated pupils make up close to 93% of the school-age population.
",
2607,1,," oxford and cambridge would still be allowed to demand people achieve the highest grades possible to gain entrance, and given the high level of demand that exists per place at each of the universities it should still be possible for both to only take in students of the highest academic calibre.
",
2608,1,,"it cannot be ignored that a potential exodus of good teaching and research staff could occur if the universities were to be changed so radically.
",
2609,1,," therefore pay incentives would be offered to prevent top academic staff from leaving over fears about the implications of the proposed changes.
",
2610,1,," the universities would be allowed a five-year changeover period in which to implement the reforms.
",
2611,0,," the current oxbridge system is , by its very nature , unequal and elitist .
",
2612,0,," the entrance exam and lengthy system of interviews are far more suited to schools that have the resources to prepare their children for them .
",
2613,0,," passing the interviews requires a staggering degree of innate talent or years of training in productive academic techniques such as debate , critical thought and the ability to read and research independently .
",
2614,0,," this is an approach to education which schools in deprived areas , trying to motivate kids from sometimes very difficult backgrounds , do not have the time or money to take up .
",
2615,0,," this was shown recently by a report from the office of fair access , which stated that the proportion of students from low-income families , defined by offa as those from families with an income of less than #,per annum , admitted by the universities has dropped since.
",
2616,0,," the brightest individuals are therefore kept out of the best institutions -- a situation which dampens aspirations among the majority of britain 's school-children and maintains a harm , in that those with the greatest potential and the strongest work ethic do not have an equal chance of being admitted to oxford or cambridge .
",
2617,0,," the high number of students at oxbridge who went to public school has meant that what is colloquially known as ` the old boy network ' has prevailed .
",
2618,0,," oxford and cambridge for example have always held a grip on the highest offices withofbritish pms having attended oxford or cambridge .
",
2619,0,," as in turn those who attend oxbridge are nearly all privileged this ensures the most influential circles of society remain the preserve of the wealthiest , yet not necessarily the most intelligent or able .
",
2620,0,," this is harmful to society at large , as it means industries are not absorbing the best that the country has to offer from all levels of society -- only those who are rich enough to get in .
",
2621,0,," the negative effects that a lack of diversity in key industries can have include the discouraging image given to young people from poorer economic backgrounds , dampening the aspirations of those whose families are not rich .
",
2622,0,," furthermore , industries such as the media , banking and the civil service are not profiting from recruiting talent from every level , hampering the potential of these sectors to be as productive as they can be .
",
2623,1,,"the number of students going into higher education after finishing compulsory education has in recent years grown astronomically with many institutions accepting more students from poorer backgrounds than ever before.
",
2624,1,," such increases are generally welcomed, both by governments and by their citizens, who hope that both their society and their children will benefit greatly from having a degree, but it naturally costs a great deal of money to fund.
",
2625,1,," the question of who should pay for higher education, and how, is an issue which is relevant to every country.
",
2626,1,," in some, such as france, germany and britain, up to the early 1990s, the state pays tuition and living costs through grants to individual students, although there may be an element of means testing.
",
2627,1,," in others, such as the usa, much of the cost of education is placed upon individual students, who pay for higher education through part-time work, parental contributions and borrowing against their future income.
",
2628,1,," the entire uk changed into a system which made all students pay a contribution towards their education through tuition fees, with cheap loans through a government program which are repaid when graduates are in employment; however inscotland, through its devolved parliament, reverted back to a state backed grant system.
",
2629,1,," the rate students were expected to pay under the new loan system was capped to ensure students from poorer backgrounds could still get an education if they had the ability.
",
2630,1,," the fee cap will have been raised greatly, in england, fromonwards.
",
2631,1,," the idea of a graduate tax has been debated in many countries, and was done so in the uk, and particularly in england before the fee cap raise, but has been most notably put into effect in australia where since the early 1990s graduates have paid an income-tax supplement related to their earnings as a means of repaying part of the cost of their university grants.
",
2632,1,," the graduate tax proposed in the uk by liberal democrat vince cable inwould work by getting students to pay for their education through taxation once they begin work, the amount paid would depend upon what they are earnings whereas in the current loan system a fixed amount is always paid back as soon as the graduate is working.
",
2633,1,," universities would receive funding entirely from the state who will retrieve the money invested in universities back through the tax system.
",
2634,0,,"the proposition proposes that the whole of the uk should switch from a loan based tuition fee system to a graduate tax whereby all students will pay an extra tax over a set period of time, when in full-time employment, alongside income tax to pay for their education.
",
2635,0,,"a graduate tax is the best way to increase access to higher education without massively burdening the government with an open-ended financial commitment .
",
2636,0,," it is not a deterrent to the poorer students in the way fees and loans-based schemes are and which simply appear to block access , yet it still delivers sufficient extra capital to fund the increase of students entering university .
",
2637,0,," australia 's introduction of a graduate tax has been successful enough to allow university places to grow rapidly following its introduction with participation from both high and low income groups increasing by approximately one third .
",
2638,0,," , chapman , b..
",
2639,0,," therefore , a graduate tax removes the expensive barriers to entry that had previously kept out low-income groups , whilst not discouraging the high-income groups from tertiary education .
",
2640,0,," a graduate tax would potentially give universities more than they get from traditional funding , as a contribution would depend directly on a person 's salary rather than just being a flat rate fare for services rendered over a short time .
",
2641,0,," for example a person earning # 40,000 would pay about #per month .
",
2642,0,," , shepard , j., that overyears could amount to # 30,000 , more than enough to cover the costs of a university education in a way which is manageable .
",
2643,0,," admittedly that sum is based on a person rising like a rocket but it still hints at the possibilities of the tax and how it could bring in more money than simply universities rising their fees .
",
2644,0,," secondly , it would change as a person 's salary rises or falls over a twenty year period , being more sustainable and increasing the chance of the costs being recovered .
",
2645,0,," thirdly , rather than giving a person a required fee to pay it would be giving a person a chance to pay over a set time period , reducing the financial impact of the bill .
",
2646,0,," a graduate tax would be fairer for everyone in society .
",
2647,0,," graduates earn considerably more than non-graduates , on average over # 100,000 more in a lifetime , channelnews ,.
",
2648,0,," , , experience lower rates of unemployment and greater job security , they therefore benefit hugely from higher education .
",
2649,0,," they should therefore be expected to pay for the privilege of having an education which has put them in that position rather than having the rest of society fund there degrees , going to university should be an honor and not a privilege .
",
2650,0,," while having a degree is useful it is not necessary for getting on with life , if someone wants to go to university they should have that opportunity regardless of their background but they should be expected to contribute to that education which is why the graduate tax works as students of all social classes can join university , not be loaded with debt and can contribute fiscally when viable .
",
2651,1,,"in 2000, the united nations convened a millennium summit to address the world’s main development challenges.
",
2652,1,,"  the identified goals were adopted bynations and set to be achieved by 2015.
",
2653,1,,"  target goal #2 was “to achieve universal primary education.”
",
2654,1,,"  since education is a clearly a universal priority as relate to the economic welfare of the world, there is increasing interest in how to meet educational goals.
",
2655,1,,"   although there is much variation in educational systems and clear differences in the economic situations across the world, one continuing theme exists:  how to best meet the needs of citizens.
",
2656,1,,"    since citizens are a product of educational systems as well as continuing contributors to education, to what degree should they be involved in the education of their children?
",
2657,1,,"  some would propose that in democratic societies, citizens always have a voice in students’ education through the political process.
",
2658,1,,"   however, at what juncture should the political process determine citizen involvement and participation?
",
2659,1,,"  should the voice of citizens come from a local jurisdiction or through a national entity?
",
2660,1,,"  questions develop around who has the most right to these decisions, who has the best insight into these decisions, and who is best able to provide for the educational needs of citizens.
",
2661,1,,"  the tension between federal or local control has philosophical roots as to the responsibilities of government and continues into the discussion of how to deal specifically with the educational needs of citizens.
",
2662,1,,"   the controversy lies in whether local control is superior to national control in the education of citizens.
",
2663,1,,"    according to oxford dictionaries online, the term local is defined as “belonging to or relating to a particular area or neighbourhood.”
",
2664,1,,"  control refers to “the power to influence or direct people’s behaviour or course of events”.
",
2665,1,,"   as there is no definition given for the term local control, those terms are combined in common usage and could refer to a municipal government, to a province, regional, or state government.
",
2666,1,,"  although not stated as a comparison, the motion implies a comparison to something, probably a federal government or national ministry.
",
2667,1,,"   education is “the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction especially at a school or university.”
",
2668,1,,"   system is defined as “a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network.”
",
2669,1,,"  there are many components to an educational system so this term is also broad.
",
2670,1,,"  since the term local control could be interpreted in a wide variety of legitimate ways, to better focus the debate, it would be valuable to indicate the expanse of the term “local”.
",
2671,1,,"  local control could legitimately mean municipalities or the regional government structure.
",
2672,1,,"  the ability to influence does not state what type of influence exactly.
",
2673,1,,"   influence could refer to all aspects of an educational system or simply influence/control over certain parts of the system.
",
2674,0,,"  even though dictionary definitions are useful, the terms set forth by the proposition require careful thought and consideration when defining them for use in a debate.
",
2675,0,,"the right of a family is central in human societies .
",
2676,0,," parents are acknowledged to be responsible for children 's upbringing .
",
2677,0,," parental involvement is key to the educational success of children .
",
2678,0,," evidence of this responsibility and right which parents embrace is illustrated in the ever increasing citizen interest in school vouchers , home schooling , special magnet schools , free schools , and private schooling which allow for parental choice and involvement .
",
2679,0,," vouchers allow students to select schools .
",
2680,0,," home schooling allows for parents to oversee education and become teachers themselves .
",
2681,0,," special and private schools are designed to meet special needs parents envision for their children .
",
2682,0,," free schools in the united kingdom are developing and gaining popularity .
",
2683,0,," in, sweden began a practice which allowed schools to be established by parents , teachers , charities and business .
",
2684,0,," additionally , parents often select to reside in a particular community or region because of the educational systems in place .
",
2685,0,," parents embrace their right and responsibility to be involved in their children 's education .
",
2686,0,," when decision making regarding curriculum and standards occurs , local authority allows for more sensitivity to community needs .
",
2687,0,," in the u.s. the authority of education was not stated but implied , in the 10th amendment to the u.s. constitution , as left to the individual states .
",
2688,0,," each state was thus empowered to exercise local control over the business of education which then fell to individual school districts .
",
2689,0,," this authority allows for each unique district to more appropriately respond to the educational needs of students .
",
2690,0,," local districts can adapt to the unique social cultural dynamics of their community and pursue more creativity in addressing educational issues which develop .
",
2691,0,," according to diane ravitch , `` the states and school districts are more flexible and pragmatic about designing reform to meet the needs of particular schools '' due to their proximity to students , schools , teachers and parents .
",
2692,0,," the national education association , a teachers association , in the u.s. supports more local control of public schools because of its ability to better address the education needs of students , teachers , and the community .
",
2693,0,," all school systems must deal with the problems of providing schoolhouses , facilities , support staff and operating expenses .
",
2694,0,," since schools operate on budgets , local control allows for a better resource management .
",
2695,0,," financial decisions regarding funding the educational system can be more flexible when at the local level .
",
2696,0,," decisions related to the operation of schools can be made with better insight than those made by the federal government .
",
2697,0,," local citizens often pay taxes to support their schools and thus have a vested interested in the efficiency of their operation .
",
2698,0,," when the decision makers controlling education are from the local community , more accountability is possible .
",
2699,0,," local pressure can be brought upon school boards and school districts from the constituency they serve .
",
2700,0,," since students ' educational needs are of importance to families in a local community , those citizens have the right and responsibility to seek accountability from their local school districts .
",
2701,1,,"the debate between ""comprehensive sex education"" (also just called ""sex education"") and ""abstinence-only education"" is long-standing in the united states, and exists in many other societies around the world that are split between more sexually progressive groups and those that generally oppose pre-marital sex.
",
2702,1,," comprehensive sex education programs, at least in the united states, generally emphasise that abstaining from sex is the safest way to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
",
2703,1,," however, comprehensive programs differ from abstinence-only programs in that they also encourage the use of condoms or other forms of contraception.
",
2704,1,,"   abstinence-only programs are much more conservative and limited in scope, teaching abstinence from sex, usually until marriage, as a means of avoiding the risk of pregnancy and stds and of enjoying other considered benefits such as a more unique sexual bond with one's ultimate partner.
",
2705,1,,"when constructing affirmative and negative cases, debaters should consider the wide range of perspectives from which these issues can be understood.
",
2706,1,," this brings together many fields of study, including sexual culture, marital culture, faith, human instincts, pregnancy, disease, and parental-school-state roles.
",
2707,1,," debaters should also be clear exactly what they are arguing for.
",
2708,1,," although abstinence-only programs are generally thought of as quite conservative, this need not prevent an affirmative team including the discussion of stis and their effects as part of these programs.
",
2709,1,," opposition side teams should be prepared to discuss the social and value-led implications of teaching children about the threat of stis in order to deter them from engaging in pre-marital sex.
",
2710,1,,"affirmative debaters should be prepared for negative debaters who attempt to argue that the affirmative team should advocate fairly traditional abstinence-programs, and cannot design a program so liberal as to be nearly identical to sex-ed programs.
",
2711,1,,"debaters should also consider what age group they are discussing: the arguments for abstinence-only with young children may be substantially different than those with older teenagers.
",
2712,0,," given that the resolution does not specify the age range, it is up to the affirmative to either defend abstinence-only in general in primary and secondary schools, or to provide solid justification for limiting the debate.
",
2713,0,,"abstinence programs teach teenagers how to have meaningful , age-appropriate relationships , and help young people fight the pressure of having sex before they are ready .
",
2714,0,," we live in a highly sexualized culture , and yet many girls report feeling guilty or regret after their first sexual experience .
",
2715,0,," indeed , according to a recent study by the kaiser family foundation , nearlypercent of sexually active teens said they feel pressured to have sex .
",
2716,0,," abstinence-only education teaches adolescents that they do not need to rush into sexual relationships by dispelling the notion that sex is something teenagers should be having , and by helping young people explore other ways of being emotionally intimate .
",
2717,0,," by leaving out discussions of sex , it reassures teenagers that they do not need to think or worry about sex until they are older , and avoids giving the impression that sex is an important or relevant topic for children .
",
2718,0,," sex carries with it a multitude of risks and responsibilities .
",
2719,0,," all sex -- even protected -- has the possibility of leading to stis or pregnancy , both of which have huge psychological , emotional , and physical impacts .
",
2720,0,," furthermore , sex can create emotional bonds between individuals which are overwhelming and intense .
",
2721,0,," young people are simply not emotionally or physically mature enough to take such risks , or accept such responsibilities , and so it is irresponsible to teach anything but abstinence .
",
2722,0,," although most previous evidence supporting abstinence-only education failed to meet high scientific standards , a recent study has presented what the washington post calls `` the first clear evidence '' that abstinence-only education really can work .
",
2723,0,," the federally funded study found that only about a third of 6th and 7th graders receiving abstinence-only education had sex over the following two years , whereas nearly half of 6th and 7th graders attending other classes became sexually active .
",
2724,0,," and , abstinence-only education did not affect condom usage , confirming what the mathematica policy research study cited by the opposition also found !
",
2725,0,," .
",
2726,0,," this suggests that good abstinence-only programs , this one , for example , did not condemn condoms , implemented at a young age , do have real effects on young people 's sexual activity .
",
2727,0,," given that cultural and social attitudes towards sex are so variable , it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic .
",
2728,0,," schools are supposed to give students the skills and knowledge they need for employment and/or higher education : sex education is a separate , much more personal , issue .
",
2729,0,," telling students to abstain ensures that no one is taught anything more than their parents want , and leaves room for parents to give a more extensive education if they so desire .
",
2730,0,," this is especially true since most parents support abstinence education anyway : a zogby international poll of u.s. parents found that% of parents think sex education classes in public schools should place more emphasis on promoting abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use .
",
2731,0,," monogamous sex is much safer than polygamous sex , as it reduces the chance of obtaining and spreading stis .
",
2732,0,," furthermore , sex outside of marriage makes it more difficult to develop intimate and trusting relationships .
",
2733,0,," random sexual partners who are unsure of each other 's fidelity can not develop the same type of unique and personal relationship that a committed couple can .
",
2734,0,," numerous studies have shown that this is the case ; having more partners increases the std risk .
",
2735,0,," and , sex before marriage goes against cultural and religious principles .
",
2736,0,," abstinence education rightly teaches teenagers that saving sex for marriage is the best way to be healthful and happy .
",
2737,1,,"in most common law countries any common assault (that is deliberate or reckless physical contact without consent) is illegal.
",
2738,1,," there are however a series of exceptions to that proposition where the public interest is deemed to justify allowing such assaults.
",
2739,1,," for example, we allow people to cause others physical harm in the name of self defence or legal war and we allow the police to cause criminals a degree of physical harm.
",
2740,1,," in all these cases physical harm is allowed either because there is no alternative or because of the urgency of the situation.
",
2741,1,," they may also be justified by claims that these actions are in the name of the greater good.
",
2742,1,,"another oft used example is that of 'lawful chastisement.'
",
2743,1,," in most cases it is legitimate to strike children for that purpose where it would not be acceptable to strike an adult.
",
2744,1,," that is, the use of physical punishment to chastise one's spouse or employee has long been deemed illegal harassment in almost all nations, particularly democracies.
",
2745,1,," when milder physical punished is used to chastise children it is usually referred to as smacking or spanking.
",
2746,1,," the law varies from country to country as to what is an acceptable level of force but very few countries (germany and sweden are notable exception) have an outright ban on parents using such force.
",
2747,1,," ""currently in england and wales, sectionof the children actenables parents to justify common assault of their children as ""reasonable punishment"", but prevents the defence being used in relation to more serious assault charges"".
",
2748,1,," in order for a punishment to be 'reasonable' it must not cause serious mental or physical damage, it must be administered only by a parent and it must be in the name of punishment – rather than say sexual pleasure or as an emotional outlet.
",
2749,1,," the debate turns not only on the moral principle behind the legitimacy of smacking itself but also on the effects of allowing smacking on the state’s ability to police child abuse.
",
2750,0,," children should receive the same legal protection from violence as adults .
",
2751,0,," it is wrong that parents can deliberately inflict pain to the extent that if inflicted on an adult it would justify prosecution .
",
2752,0,," in a number of countries , including the united kingdom , children are the most vulnerable members of society , yet the only group which can be legally assaulted .
",
2753,0,," the council of europe -- which monitors compliance with the european convention on human rights -- ruled inthat smacking violated children 's rights against cruel and degrading treatment1 .
",
2754,0,," furthermore , as time reports , a hundred years ago ` it was considered a novel idea for the law to say you could n't hit your wife .
",
2755,0,," today ... children are the only class that is unprotected '.
",
2756,0,," this is not right , ` children ... need more protection and not less '.
",
2757,0,," it is time to right this wrong .
",
2758,0,," the existing mechanisms to catch abusive parents are entrenched in most societies ; child abuse claims are often the result of third-party observers , often teachers , calling the police or child services .
",
2759,0,," such a system would be expected to play a greater role in societies with a ban on smacking -- initial penalties would be financial only , to ensure that parents are taken away from their children only if they have proven themselves repeat offenders .
",
2760,0,," this charge would only be if the child is underyears of age .
",
2761,0,," parents who feel that smacking is an appropriate tool of discipline ` have to give up the privilege to physically discipline their children for the sake of protecting children that are n't being hit once in a blue moon or in a light way , but are really being hit day after day , many times a day '.
",
2762,0,," only an outright ban on smacking will enhance child protection .
",
2763,0,," the number of children reporting being beaten to the point of bruising in germany has declined fromintoinsinceafter a ban was introduced in germany .
",
2764,0,," a culture that tolerates smacking makes it easier to conceal graver abuse .
",
2765,0,," frequently , incidents of abuse reported by children are not investigated , or the cases abandoned as the abuse is written off as a case of `` legitimate punishment '' .
",
2766,0,," a total ban enables child protection workers to give the parents of children at risk of abuse a clear message that no level of corporal punishment is acceptable .
",
2767,0,," a parent who still continues to smack their child would no longer be able to hide behind the defence of `` reasonable chastisement '' .
",
2768,0,," in european countries with a longstanding smacking ban , there has been an increase in the early detection of children at risk , and a decrease in the proportion of parents who are subsequently prosecuted .
",
2769,0,," smacking , however occasional , is harmful to children .
",
2770,0,," as well as causing physical pain there are lasting psychological effects .
",
2771,0,," it is widely recognised that smacking undermines children 's confidence , weakens their emotional relationships and encourages the use of violence to resolve disputes with siblings and classmates .
",
2772,0,," the experience of childhood smacking has even been linked with an increased risk of alcoholism , depression , masochistic fantasy and suicidal ideation in adult life .
",
2773,0,," professor murray straus tested the iqs of children , spanked and not spanked , and found that the iqs of kids who were not spanked stayed the same over a four year period whilst the spanked toddlers dropped up topoints1 .
",
2774,0,," the un convention on the rights of the child requires the countries to protect children from `` all forms of physical and mental violence '' .
",
2775,0,," the committee on the rights of the child , its international monitoring body for the convention , emphasises that even physical punishment within the family is not compatible with full implementation , and has formally recommended prohibition to the uk and other countries .
",
2776,0,," inthe european court of human rights found that the beating by a father of his stepson constituted `` inhuman or degrading punishment '' .
",
2777,0,," the law in britain and other countries that tolerate smacking should be brought into line with european law to ensure the respect of basic human rights .
",
2778,0,," smacking is harmful to society as normative forms of violence spill over into criminal forms .
",
2779,0,," as corporal punishment is a significant factor in the development of violent behaviour in childhood and later life , an outright ban would help measures to reduce violence and crime .
",
2780,0,," banning smacking would also help to promote the concept of zero tolerance of violence between all family members and thus reduce all forms of domestic violence , as well as reducing bullying between children .
",
2781,0,," as sir al aynsley-green , children 's commissioner in england , has noted , ` we continue to send out confusing messages to parents about the acceptable use of violence across society1 .
",
2782,0,," a strong , consistent message needs to be applied , starting with a total ban of smacking .
",
2783,1,,"merit pay for state school teachers means rewarding teachers for better performance according to specific and measurable criteria.
",
2784,1,," state schools are schools that the government provides (in the us and canada known as ‘public schools’), as opposed to ‘private schools’, which are schools created and financed by the private sector/civil society.
",
2785,1,,"merit pay is a broad term that may encompass a number of alternatives to the traditional salary schedules used in most schools.
",
2786,1,,"  for instance, teachers can be rewarded for individual performance and/or for the performance of their entire department/school.
",
2787,1,," teachers can also be paid fully based on merit, or have a fixed base salary on top of which financial rewards are added whenever performance exceeds the criteria.
",
2788,1,,"  and, teachers might be rewarded for taking on additional duties or responsibilities.
",
2789,1,,"  in this case, we assume that merit pay means that teachers will receive individual rewards for performance on top of a some base salary, but will try to keep the arguments as general as possible.
",
2790,1,," if the arguments refer to another case definition, it will be noted and explained.
",
2791,1,,"  we also assume that teacher performance is assessed based on student performance, specifically how much their students improve on specified, standardized tests.
",
2792,1,,"merit pay for teachers is currently a hot topic in the united states.
",
2793,1,," for example, on march 24, 2011, governor rick scott of florida signed a bill to put this motion in effect.
",
2794,1,," the state of denver introduced a merit-based pay programme into its school system in 2004, with teachers’ approval.
",
2795,0,," just as in the private sector , workers should be judged and rewarded on the actual results they achieve .
",
2796,0,," whether it 's through sheer talent or through hard work , some teachers consistently deliver better results than other teachers .
",
2797,0,," those teachers are more effective and efficient at providing societal value : with the same amount of work-hours they manage to more effectively educate children .
",
2798,0,," it is therefore only just that their pay is differentiated according to the results they achieve .
",
2799,0,," for decades now , teachers have been remunerated based on ` seniority ' .
",
2800,0,," this means that they do n't have an incentive anymore to improve themselves , no matter how motivated they were at the beginning .
",
2801,0,," why try to improve yourself if you have nothing to gain from it ?
",
2802,0,," adding a financial reward for exceptional performance will motivate teachers to do their utmost to develop the knowledge and talents of their pupils .
",
2803,0,," teaching salaries for years have remained steady or even declined .
",
2804,0,," this made teaching as a job unattractive and so the influx of new , talented teachers halted .
",
2805,0,," although the effect of fiscal changes on teachers ' pay has been minimal , controlling for the consequences of the financial crisis , high productivity has become central to many private sector pay schemes .
",
2806,0,," as a result , the contrast between non-responsive pay for teachers and high rewards for talented private sector employees has become more pronounced .
",
2807,0,," with the opportunity to increase income through performance , teacher pay can rise , making it a more attractive profession financially .
",
2808,0,," measuring teachers ' performances will create a transparent market for teaching talent .
",
2809,0,," underperforming teachers will be selected out because they are less in demand , unless they adapt and learn from what their competitors apparently do better .
",
2810,0,," so , the overall quality of the teacher pool will rise and this will increase the quality of education for all students .
",
2811,1,,"sex education has been taught in schools in a range of countries around the world for nearly a century in various forms it has become a fixture in schools in most western countries.
",
2812,1,," the specifics of the education program vary between countries, but they all generally deal with the basics of reproduction, physiological development, sexual health, practice, and safety.
",
2813,1,," in recent decades many countries, such as germany sinceand sweden as far back as 1956, have made sex education a mandatory part of schooling, a policy that has been met with extensive criticism, particularly from religious groups.
",
2814,1,," their criticism is that sex education is permissive toward young people’s sexual relationships and thus morally corrosive.
",
2815,1,,"opposition also derives from an objection to an extension of the state’s involvement into the family and questions of sexuality.
",
2816,1,," in developing countries sex education schemes have developed in part at least to attempt to stem the  hiv/aids epidemic,although some religious groups have opposed these developments.
",
2817,1,," in western nations howeversex education is not always mandatory, in  england and wales for example parents can refuse to let their children take part in some although not in all lessons which provide information about sex and reproduction.
",
2818,1,," proponents of mandatory sex education highlight the benefits it provides in delaying the age of first intercourse, preventing sexually transmitted disease and teenage pregnancy and in providing useful information for life regarding sexuality and sexual expression.
",
2819,1,," opponents contend that sex education encourage early sexual relationships and the risks which attend that and  should be the purview of parents, and that forcing it to be provided in schools undermines trust in the education system and harms the individuals’ relationship with the state and society.
",
2820,0,," it was said at the beginning of the hiv/aids epidemic that the only vaccination against the virus was knowledge .
",
2821,0,," knowledge about what is out there is essential to guarding the self .
",
2822,0,," there are a several of ways in which this knowledge is essential ; finding out about the risks of sex is just one , having accurate information about the pleasures as well as the risks is another .
",
2823,0,," knowledge also prevents misinformation .
",
2824,0,," young people must be informed about sex , how it works and what the risks associated with it are , and how to access the risks and the pleasures .
",
2825,0,," when sex is not talked about and kept behind closed doors , young people are forced often to grope around in the dark , so to speak .
",
2826,0,," this can result in unwanted pregnancies , and even stds , some of which can be permanent , a threat to fertility or even life threatening .
",
2827,0,," it leaves young people confused .
",
2828,0,," the state thus owes an obligation to its citizens to prepare them adequately for their interactions in society , including those of a sexual nature .
",
2829,0,," a mandatory sex education regime serves as a defence against misinformation about sex .
",
2830,0,," religious organizations , most notably in the united states , promote abstinence by lying about the effectiveness of contraception and about the transmission of stds .
",
2831,0,," when such activity is not countered by a scientific explanation of sex and sexual practices a culture of ignorance develops that can have serious negative social and health effects on those who are misinformed .
",
2832,0,," an example of the benefits of sex education is highlighted in the case of the united states .
",
2833,0,," in primarily liberal states where sex education is mandatory , young people are statistically more likely to be sexually active .
",
2834,0,," at the same time in states where sex education is banned or deliberately misleading , teen pregnancy rates are much higher .
",
2835,0,," clearly the trade-off between high promiscuity rates on the one hand and much higher rates of teen pregnancy and stds on the other stands in the favour of sex education .
",
2836,0,," young people live now in a society which is very sexualised it has been described as a carnal jungle .
",
2837,0,," adults need to offer guidance about negotiating a way through the messages about sex which proliferate in the mass media and consumer culture .
",
2838,0,," underlying this discussion is controversy about what sex education should be .
",
2839,0,," sex education has become a shorthand term for the broader subject of personal relationships , sexual health and education about sexuality it is clear that views about what sex education should be and what it should contain has changed significantly over time .
",
2840,0,," high quality sex education should not only contain factual information about the physiological issues of sexual development and reproduction .
",
2841,0,," it should also offer safe spaces for young people to consider the social and emotional aspects of sexuality and the social and peer pressures that arise in youth cultures .
",
2842,0,," sex and sexual identity is fundamental part of human life .
",
2843,0,," sexual desire , for both procreation and recreation , forms one of the core human drives that shapes behaviour .
",
2844,0,," young people want to explore their own , and one another 's , bodies from quite an early age , long before they would be likely to settle down and get married .
",
2845,0,," sex for almost everyone in western countries is not something exclusive to marriage , and most people have multiple sexual partners in their lifetimes .
",
2846,0,," in order to face this reality , young people must be armed with the knowledge of what sexual intercourse entails and the pleasures and the risks inherent in it .
",
2847,0,," sexual identity itself can be very confusing , especially for young homosexual or transgender people who may not understand their sexuality .
",
2848,0,," a safe , objective environment in which the objective physical facts and the emotional aspects of sexual involvement and activity is provided is essential to facilitate young people to come to grips with sexual identity as it is essential for full development as a person .
",
2849,0,," parents have a great deal of responsibility in raising children , but they are unsuited to teaching about sexuality as the resulting education will not be consistent , be biased and in some cases may not be carried out at all .
",
2850,0,," parents tend to view their children as less sexualized ; they want them to be innocent .
",
2851,0,," thus it is often the case that parents seek to shield their children from the realities of sex , and themselves from the young person 's developing sexuality maintaining their innocence through enforced ignorance .
",
2852,0,," this tends to be particularly harmful to young women , as culturally boys are often expected to be more sexually active than girls , and such activity is usually considered appropriate for boys , while not so for girls .
",
2853,0,," a double standard undoubtedly continues to exist .
",
2854,0,," it is in the interest of the state , however , to produce well-rounded individuals who can interact with society effectively on all levels , including the sexual level .
",
2855,0,," when parents do not provide adequate sex education , it is the state that is forced to pick up the tab to pay for std treatment and teen mothers .
",
2856,0,," people dropping out of school due to pregnancy , and individuals who are unable to work due to debilitating venereal disease impose a steep cost on society .
",
2857,0,," it is thus the state 's duty to provide what parents often can not for the sake of society as a whole .
",
2858,0,," leaving sex education in the hands of parents has the further negative impact of normalizing incorrect or bigoted views regarding sexuality .
",
2859,0,," homophobic families , for example , will not be able to provide the necessary information to homosexual children , who will suffer not only from lack of education , but also from a lack of sexual self-worth .
",
2860,0,," mandatory sex education can right the wrongs of such misinformation and bias .
",
2861,0,," communities and organizations that oppose sex education can actually benefit from it .
",
2862,0,," unfortunately this is often not appreciated by the communities involved .
",
2863,0,," one argument is that shielding children from knowledge of sex and sexual practice is disrespectful to religion .
",
2864,0,," religious and moral abstinence is defined by the decision not to have sex , not by the absence of knowledge of the existence of sex itself .
",
2865,0,," sex education can even be beneficial to understanding the religious and ethical perspective toward sexuality when it provides necessary discussion of the emotional aspects of sexuality .
",
2866,0,," information simply allows people to make fuller , informed decisions .
",
2867,0,," sex education does not serve to normalize sexual activity and lewd behavior , as religious groups fear , because everything in life is already sexualized .
",
2868,0,," one need only watch a typical perfume ad on television to know that sexuality inculcates popular culture already .
",
2869,0,," sex education would not lift the scales from the eyes of children entirely ; they already have some idea of what is going on .
",
2870,0,," the danger is when they know something about sex , but not enough to be safe .
",
2871,0,," that is why mandatory sex education is essential to people 's wellbeing .
",
2872,0,," the research evidence from across the world is clear that sex education holds back the age of first intercourse and most certainly does not foster early promiscuity .
",
2873,0,," the abstinence programmes that have been developed in the united states in particular have been spectacularly unsuccessful in reducing rates of sexual exploration and std and unwanted pregnancy rates .
",
2874,0,," research has made it clear which kinds of sex education are most effective .
",
2875,1,,"a voucher system is one in which, instead of tax revenues being distributed directly to state-managed schools, parents are issued with vouchers that can be spent on education in any school, whether it is managed by the state or not.
",
2876,1,," schools therefore compete for pupils and the funds that come with them.
",
2877,1,,"such a scheme was originally put forward by milton friedman in the 1950s and now systems of voucher funding are in place in several american states and european municipalities.
",
2878,1,," the idea was also briefly the basis for a reform of uk nursery funding.
",
2879,0,," state education in some areas of the uk is continuing to fail , despite increased investment .
",
2880,0,," this will allow those pupils who are currently locked into sub-standard state education access to the private schools enjoyed by their more privileged peers , because you can spend the vouchers anywhere .
",
2881,0,," even if private school fees can only be subsidised by the voucher scheme , most private schools are charitable organisations that do not run a profit , and so in the vast majority of circumstances the voucher will make private schools accessible to poorer families .
",
2882,0,," state schools will , like the private schools , have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere .
",
2883,0,," this incentivises in particular high level management , who , if the school fails , will be out of a job with a blot on their record .
",
2884,0,," different parents have different values and priorities , and it is entirely legitimate for them to wish to pass these on to their children .
",
2885,0,," the state does not know any better than them with which values the ideal life can be lived .
",
2886,0,," further , children are individuals who respond in very different ways to different styles of teaching .
",
2887,0,," parents know their children better than central government possibly could , and so are the best placed to decide what sort of school their child should go to .
",
2888,0,," currently , there is very little state provision for non-mainstream styles of learning , whereas in the private sector there is a big incentive for educational innovation .
",
2889,1,,"the united states has suffered from racial disparity even before it was a nation, and the lasting effects of institutions of racism are still apparent in society today.
",
2890,1,," in 1954, the supreme court ruled that segregated public schools are unconstitutional because they disadvantage african-american students.
",
2891,1,," today, however, the education system continues to fail to properly serve black students, who consistently perform lower and are more likely to drop out than their white peers.1 some in the education community have argued that african-american males might be better served by one-race, one-sex schools.
",
2892,1,," they argue that racial separation is not racist if it is carefully designed to benefit a disadvantaged minority.
",
2893,0,," opponents argue that, while intentions might be good, this is simply another form of the segregation that has done american society so much damage.1 sharon lewis, candace simon, renatauzzell, amanda horwitz, michael casserly, ""a call for change: the social and educational factors contributing to the outcomes of black males in urban schools,"" the council of the great city schools, october 2010, 3.
",
2894,0,,"schools in the us focus primarily on european history and a version of american history that does not adequately cover african-american history .
",
2895,0,," a few experimental schools with all black students have incorporated an `` afrocentric '' curriculum , which focuses more on african history than european history and places a greater emphasis on the role of african-americans in united states history .1 when students learn history as something that includes them , rather than the story of some other people , they are more likely to be engaged in the subject matter as they have a personal connection to the history , they will be learning their own history not someone else 's .1 ibid ,.
",
2896,0,," even though the state requires mandatory education , the constitution respects the right of free choice and free association : catholics , for example , are free to attend schools with all-catholic populations , and girls can go to schools that serve only girls .
",
2897,0,," the result is that students are allowed to attend the schools that serve them best .
",
2898,0,," but this should not be a privilege given only to those who can afford private schooling .
",
2899,0,," public school students , too , deserve options that serve them - and those options should include single-sex , single-race schools .
",
2900,0,," equality under the law does not mean sameness .
",
2901,0,," in mainstream schools which track students by ability , as many as 1/3 of black male students are incorrectly placed in slower classes .1 these lower-end classes are often assigned the worst teachers , reserving the better teachers for a school 's honor classes .2 consequently , black males are often prevented from receiving an equal education in integrated schools .
",
2902,0,," allowing black males to be educated in an environment isolated from racial tensions and inequalities eliminates the psychological impact of `` tracking '' in integrated public schools .
",
2903,0,," 1 narine ,.
",
2904,0,," 2ibid ,.
",
2905,0,," despite almost sixty years of integration , black students lag behind whites , and the difference is even greater for males .1 onlypercent of black fourth-grade boys are proficient in reading , compared withpercent of white boys , and onlypercent of black eighth-grade boys are proficient in math , compared withpercent of white boys .2 figures that are not explained just by poverty .
",
2906,0,," the idyllic image of integrated schools does not line up to reality ; black males are still at great risk for dropping out of school , being imprisoned and murdered at rates several times higher than young white men .
",
2907,0,," there is evidence to show that this alternative school system may benefit its students ; educators should not reject the opportunity without giving it a fair chance .
",
2908,0,," 1 lewis ,.
",
2909,0,," 2gabriel ,in the us , black males are at a higher risk for murder , drug use , and imprisonment than any other group - they are 6.5 times more likely to be imprisoned than white males .1 they are disproportionately affected by drug use , violence , single parenting , poverty , racial profiling , and other factors that alienate them from society .2 education specialists argue that because black males currently perform worse than any other group in school , teachers assume their black male students will be low performers and treat them differently .3 this treatment causes these students to accept defeat before they have been given a chance to show their potential .
",
2910,0,," an educational environment that is specially designed to push black male students to succeed and take pride in their identity would eliminate the feeling of inferiority which integrated schools often impose .
",
2911,0,," this means that all-black , all-male schools which are publicly funded are needed in order to directly address the needs of african-american male students in modern society .
",
2912,0,," this does not mean that black males should be compelled to attend these schools , and , while this argument focuses on black males , the proposition is amenable to schools which address the needs of other minorities and minority females .

",
2917,1,,"selection can take various forms but for the purpose of this debate it means the overt selection by ability, usually on the basis of a test.
",
2918,1,," this usually happens at secondary level; very few primary schools are selective.
",
2919,1,," selection does occur in higher education, however this is a separate topic and will not be covered here.comprehensive schools, on the other hand, are mixed-ability and pupils are accepted regardless of their ability.
",
2920,1,," the vast majority of education systems in developed countries are now comprehensive.
",
2921,1,," nordic countries are almost completely comprehensive, whilst german-speaking countries tend to be almost completely selective with a three tier system.
",
2922,1,," english-speaking countries do have some features of both; england is almost completely comprehensive but has retainedgrammar schools, where, like some schools in some states in usa and australia, pupils are selected following an exam.
",
2923,1,," but what are the costs and benefits of each system?
",
2924,1,," which produces more equal outcomes?
",
2925,1,," does one produce more intelligent, more employable individuals than the other?
",
2926,1,," who does selection actually benefit?
",
2927,1,," the debate below will focus on the arguments for and against comprehensive and selective systems and will look at each perspective in greater detail.
",
2928,0,,"  children are different and there should be different kinds of schools to meet their individual needs and talents .
",
2929,0,," children with a talent for music or sport should go to special schools to help them develop their gifts .
",
2930,0,," less academic children need a vocational education -- one that gives them useful skills to pre-pare them for the workplace .
",
2931,0,," bright children need more academic schools that push them to learn and achieve as much as they can .
",
2932,0,," selecting students by ability is the way to make sure we provide each one with the best type of education for them .
",
2933,0,," for example in germany pupils are streamed into a specific educational route at the age oforyear olds where they largely remain for the remainder of their statutory education .
",
2934,0,," a mixed-ability gesamtschule was introduced `` to pursue a common base for learning ''but the majority of pupils enter the traditional selective system which is divided into three main types of secondary schooling .
",
2935,0,," the hauptschule offers some vocational-oriented courses as well as general subjects and leads to part-time enrolment in a vocational school combined with apprenticeship training until the age of; the realschule leads to part-time and higher vocational schools and the gymnasium , based on the classical education , leads to the abitur and prepares students for university or a dual academic and vocational credential .
",
2936,0,," it is possible for students with high academic achievement at the realschule to switch to a gymnasium on graduation .
",
2937,0,," germany scores higher than the average of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , oecd , in maths and literacy and has continued to improve these scores over the years as well as raising the achievement of the lowest per-forming pupils , pisa .
",
2938,0,," 1 susanne wiborg , ` education and social integration : a comparative study of the comprehensive school system in scandinavia ' , london review of education ,.
",
2939,1,,"the debate concerning the legitimacy of formal prayer in public schools channels two raging currents of american constitutional law - the regulation of education and the protection of religious liberty.
",
2940,1,," the republic was founded by emigrants from europe who sought to escape the bondage of laws which compelled their support and attendance at government sponsored churches.
",
2941,1,," accordingly, the first amendment of the constitution of the united states provides inter alia that: “congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”.
",
2942,1,," thus religious liberty receives the dual protection of the establishment clause, that demands the separation of government and governmental functions from religious doctrine, and the free exercise clause, that precludes government interference with the exercise of religion.
",
2943,1,," on behalf of the court, chief justice warren in brown v. board of education (‘brown i’)u.s. 483,s. ct.
",
2944,1,,"held that education is “perhaps the most important function of state and local governments”.
",
2945,1,," it is therefore unsurprising that the court has consistently struck down school prayer initiated by school officials as a violation of the establishment clause.
",
2946,1,," however, the strictness of scrutiny devoted to apparently innocuous religious practice remains remarkable.
",
2947,1,," the court has rejected non-denominational prayers as unconstitutional: engel v. vitaleu.
",
2948,1,,"s. 421,s. ct.
",
2949,1,," 1261.
",
2950,1,," it has also found that non-sectarian prayers violate the establishment clause: lee v. weismanu.
",
2951,1,,"s. 577,s. ct.
",
2952,1,," 2649.
",
2953,1,," the court has struck down an alabaman law authorizing schools to set aside one minute at the start of each day for meditation or voluntary prayer: wallace v. jaffreeu.
",
2954,1,,"s. 38,s. ct.
",
2955,1,," 2479.
",
2956,1,," not even a high school program that empowered the student body to elect a student speaker who would precede varsity football games by delivering a short speech to “solemnize the event” survived the scrutiny of the justices: santa fe independent school district v. doeu.
",
2957,1,,"s. 290,s. ct.
",
2958,1,," 2266.
",
2959,1,," given the prevailing jurisprudence, it is remarkably unlikely that public school prayer could be rendered constitutional in the united states at least in the foreseeable future.
",
2960,1,," nevertheless, no commentator would be advised to dismiss a debate that has captivated the most dynamic constitutional court in the world throughout the past century.
",
2961,1,,"this topic demands consideration of broad social and philosophical themes that include the proper extent to which a school should be paternalist; the separation of church and state; and role of the democratic imperative in education.
",
2962,1,," moreover, the circumstances of this debate are not limited to the school and judicial systems of the united states.
",
2963,1,," the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedomsalso recognises “the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion” under article 9.
",
2964,1,," in the united kingdom, the relationship between religious liberty and public education has commonly attracted controversy in the context of faith-based schools whose admission policies are dependent upon proof of religious practice.
",
2965,1,," many of the arguments canvassed in this debate are cross-applicable to just such a discussion of religious schools.
",
2966,0,," a pupil is unable to give or withhold their consent to participating in school prayer .
",
2967,0,," this is because the school environment does not facilitate the free exercise of consent .
",
2968,0,," it mandates attendance , it is delivered in an inherently instructional facility , and its subjects are immature , having underdeveloped faculties of resistance and consent , and being subject to the pressure of their peers .
",
2969,0,," the supreme court in santa fe independent school district v. doe recognised the significance of social influence upon pupils exerted by colleagues and staff , and that in any school environment , a prayer will be seen as an approved action by the school which is unconstitutional .
",
2970,0,," a pupil does not opt into the practice of prayer - the practice typically takes place in the context of an assembly at which attendance is compulsory .
",
2971,0,," the consent of the pupil to the prayer is therefore not sought but merely presumed .
",
2972,0,," religious discrimination is completely unacceptable and should certainly not be condoned or even facilitated by a school .
",
2973,0,," yet , in order to be meaningful , a prayer must also be discriminatory between different religious beliefs .
",
2974,0,," the imprecation of one deity , as opposed to another or several others , the choice of language and the supplication sought are distinctive to each faith .
",
2975,0,," the incorporation of any or all such addresses into a single prayer at best confuses its meaning , and at worst renders it meaningless .
",
2976,0,," where the practical precatory choice is between discrimination and equivocation no school prayer should be permitted .
",
2977,0,," the court in pierce v. society of sisters and wisconsin v. yoder recognised that the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing of children under their control extends to the religious faith that is imparted to the children .
",
2978,0,," the proper purpose of schooling is not indoctrination .
",
2979,0,," should religion be considered a valuable part of a balanced curriculum , it ought to be taught in a broad and critical context in the classroom .
",
2980,0,," a formal prayer instills obedience to a faith that the child might neither understand nor accept and to which the parent or guardian might properly object .
",
2981,0,," the practice does not stimulate discussion or debate and therefore has no place in schools .
",
2982,0,," if regulations were to change and prayers allowed based upon the expressed desires of students and parents , it would be almost impossible to ensure that each individual was receiving what they or their parents would consider the `` proper '' exposure to faith or religion .
",
2983,0,," not only would it be logistically difficult and disruptive to allow students not to attend public prayers , it would also be very difficult to ensure that this was being done .
",
2984,0,," only by ensuring that it is not allowed can this problem be solved -- that way those who do want to pray are of course still able to do so and those who do not want to be a part of it or whose parents do n't wish them to be involved may not be forced into doing so .
",
2985,0,," evidence for this can actually be seen from an attempt to ensure that schools carry out prayer in wales where it is a legal obligation .
",
2986,0,," the school standards and framework act  set out that every pupil `` shall on each school day take part in an act of collective worship . ''
",
2987,0,," a bbc survey showed in fact that less than half of the schools inspected carried out this obligation - and equally if schools in america were permitted to conduct prayer , the level of continuity and the monitoring of whether or not the rights of the children under the constitution were being breached would be an impossible task .
",
2988,1,," as the growth of the global economy has slowed in recent years, so too have young university graduates found their job prospects declining.
",
2989,1,," for many, the inclination has been to return to where they were most comfortable, namely academia.
",
2990,1,," the result has been an explosion in the number of applications to masters programs, and in the united states and the united kingdom in particular, applications to law school.
",
2991,1,," but is a law degree worth it?
",
2992,1,," a jd degree from a private us school, or a gdl or accelerated llb from a uk institution can easily run beyond $120,000 in costs (and up to £30,000 in the uk).
",
2993,1,," while salaries in the legal sector are high, the legal field has not been immune to the recession itself.
",
2994,0,," a number of critics have come out to argue that law degrees are not worth the cost; they have also accused law schools of deliberately advertising themselves as a gateway to a number of jobs which do not in fact require the degrees.
",
2995,0,,"a law degree is first and foremost a requirement of being a lawyer .
",
2996,0,," anyone with any interest in working in the legal field , serving as a judge , or even working in a number of governmental and non-profit fields will quite simply need to attend law school at some point .
",
2997,0,," if you are already a recipient of such a degree , it will increase the opportunities for advancement within your chosen career .
",
2998,0,," a jd is not simply a gateway to the legal world .
",
2999,0,," lawyers work as corporate executives , run movie studios , hold political office , and teach academically .
",
3000,0,," holding the degree will increase your qualifications , and make it far easier to move up the ladder in whatever field you chose to enter even if it is not a legal one .
",
3001,0,," law school is a good way to spend your time and wait out the bad economy .
",
3002,0,," by the time a law degree has run its course , the economy will have improved , and you will have a lot more options available , whether you still want to be a lawyer or not .
",
3003,0,," indeed , the uk based law school bpp has previously advertised its courses as a `` recession proof investment '' , arguing that returns , in terms of wages , on an individual 's course fees could potentially be greater than equities or risky financial instruments .
",
3004,0,," lawyers are often extremely high paid , and occupy a prestigious position in society .
",
3005,0,," a law degree is key to entry to the top tier of society and high income earners .
",
3006,0,," law schools teaches you to `` think '' more critically , and legal work offers the opportunity to engage in a largely intellectual pursuit with other highly intellectual individuals .
",
3007,0,," law students are likely to develop a wider range of intellectual skills throughout their careers , and will be better able to transition in to different jobs and different areas of the legal industry if needed .
",
3008,0,," moreover , the level of enjoyment that individuals derive from their jobs - and thus the nature of the hedonic calculus that they engage in when determining whether a particular job will fully account for their needs - is linked partly to the variety and difficulty of the tasks they must accomplish .
",
3009,0,," law represents a sustained and engaging intellectual challenge , and a challenge ideally suited to the skills of most humanities graduates .
",
3010,0,,"the main goal of this program is increasing school enrollment overall .
",
3011,0,," if it was too much to expect from families , then the program would have failed in the cases that it was instituted .
",
3012,0,," however , the opposite has been the case .
",
3013,0,," 12.4 million families in brazil are enrolled in a program called bolsa familia where children 's attendance in school is rewarded with $a month per child .
",
3014,0,," the number of brazilians with incomes below $a month has decreased by% year since, and 1/6 of the poverty reduction in the country is attributed to this program .
",
3015,0,," additionally it is much less expensive than other programs , costing only about .5 % of the country 's gdp .
",
3016,0,," considering that this program has been affordable and successful in both reducing poverty and increasing school enrollment it is worth using as an incentive in more programs around the world .
",
3017,0,," when society has to step in and provide for those who 've proved themselves unable to provide for themselves that should reasonably create certain expectations on the part of those being helped .
",
3018,0,," in almost every aspect of life , money is given in return for a product , service or behavior .
",
3019,0,," it is the same with welfare payments ; money in exchange for children being put in school .
",
3020,0,," we expect parents to do a good job in their role as parents .
",
3021,0,," ensuring that their children attend school is a crucial part of parental responsibility .
",
3022,0,," children on welfare in the us aretimes more likely to drop out of school , however studies have shown that children who are part of early childhood education are more likely to finish school and remain independent of welfare1 .
",
3023,0,," thus , when a parent is a welfare recipient , it is entirely reasonable to make it conditional on sending their kids to school .
",
3024,0,," if tax payers ' dollars are being spent on those who can not provide for themselves , there needs to be a societal return .
",
3025,0,," one of the greatest complaints about welfare is that people work hard for the money that they earn , which is then handed to others with no direct benefit to society .
",
3026,0,," if children of people on welfare are in school it increases the likelihood that they will finish high school , maybe get a scholarship and go to college , and have the necessary tools to contribute to the work force and better society .
",
3027,1,,"creationism, often rebranded as intelligent design, is the belief that intelligent agency was involved in the creation and development of life on earth.
",
3028,1,," the view purports to be a science and to be deserving of consideration not only by the scientific community, but also students.
",
3029,1,," for this reason creationists have been involved in raising public awareness about the flaws they see in evolution, and have created major controversies, and it has become a particular issue in the united states.
",
3030,1,," in britain, schools must teach evolution as part of the national curriculum, but are not barred from teaching creationism as well, and some religious schools, such as emmanuel college in gateshead, have done so, presenting creationism as fact and evolution as a matter of faith.
",
3031,1,," in the usa, pressure has been put on school boards to enforce the teaching of creationism and evolution as equally controversial scientific theories (as in ohio), or to remove evolution from the list of examination topics and therefore make it less likely to be taught (as in kansas).
",
3032,1,," while creationists have found mixed success in the furtherance of their views on the political stage they have met with far stauncher and more unified opposition from the scientific community, which has largely denounced creationism as religion in the borrowed clothes of science.
",
3033,1,," the controversy remains in spite of this denunciation.
",
3034,1,," debates on teaching creationism in school revolve around the questions of whether creationism can be considered a legitimate scientific position, and whether it stands up to empirical scrutiny.
",
3035,1,,"important note: in any debate regarding evolution, abiogenesis, and creationism, it is important to work out from the start what is under discussion.
",
3036,1,," creationists in particular use ambiguity to their advantage in debates.
",
3037,1,," for example, if the debate is on evolution, should he feel cornered, a creationist will often try to turn the conversation to the question of the origin of life, or of the planet.
",
3038,1,," sometimes they will go so far as to ask for an explanation of the beginning of the universe.
",
3039,1,," while all these do have scientific explanations, they have nothing whatsoever to do with evolution.
",
3040,1,," debates should always be kept on topic or else they have a strong tendency to get very messy indeed.
",
3041,1,," useful definitions.
",
3042,1,,"- scientific theory: ""a systematic ideational structure of broad scope, conceived by the human imagination, that encompasses a family of empirical (experiential) laws regarding regularities existing in objects and events, both observed and posited.
",
3043,1,," a scientific theory is a structure suggested by these laws and is devised to explain them in a scientifically rational manner.""
",
3044,1,,"-evolution: ""the biological theory that animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations.""
",
3045,1,,"-abiogenesis: ""the field of science dedicated to studying how life might have arisen for the first time on the primordial young earth.""
",
3046,0,," many scientists do not accept the conclusions of the evolutionists .
",
3047,0,," people like dr. michael behe have dedicated themselves to exposing the flaws in evolution and showing that there is very real disagreement within the scientific community .
",
3048,0,," this controversy is highlighted in the many court cases , books , and televised debates occurring in countries all over the world .
",
3049,0,," children deserve to hear about the controversy , and not to simply be fed one story set for them by the prevailing majority in the scientific community , even if that community can not claim anything near consensus .
",
3050,0,," until consensus is reached and indisputable proof of one theory or the other given , both sides should be taught in schools .
",
3051,0,," the opinion of the scientific community with regard to facts and theories has a great propensity to change with time .
",
3052,0,," once scientists adamantly maintained that the earth was flat .
",
3053,0,," for centuries it also maintained that there were two kinds of blood flowing through the human body .
",
3054,0,," science is not infallible and the prevailing theory is no more than the opinion currently in vogue among scholars .
",
3055,0,," in light of new evidence , theories can change over time , giving way to better explanations .
",
3056,0,," for this reason , the evolutionists ' dogmatic adherence to their position in spite of contrary evidence provided by creationists is hard to understand .
",
3057,0,," however , it becomes clear why the scientific establishment takes such a confrontational position toward creationism when one considers that many eminent scientists and researchers have built their careers within the paradigm of evolution , and their research often depends wholly on its acceptance .
",
3058,0,," these scientists would lose their exalted position in the light of a paradigm-shift in scientific understanding away from evolution .
",
3059,0,," it is for this reason that scientists who adhere to established norms so often fight things like creationism , even though they provide explanations where evolution can not .
",
3060,0,," for science to progress , these conservative impulses must be fought against , which is why it is essential that when science is taught , so are all the prevailing theories concerning branches of the sciences , including creationism .
",
3061,0,," nature is marked by clear design .
",
3062,0,," the complexity of the human body , of ecosystems , and even of bacteria , attests to the existence of creative agency .
",
3063,0,," it is impossible that such things as , for example , interdependent species could come to exist without the guidance of a designer .
",
3064,0,," likewise , certain organisms can be shown to be irreducibly complex , meaning that if one were to remove any part of it , it would lose all functionality .
",
3065,0,," this refutes the gradualist argument of evolution , since there is no selective pressure on the organism to change when it is functionless .
",
3066,0,," for example , the bacterial flagellum , the `` motor '' that powers bacterial cells , loses all functionality if a single component is removed .
",
3067,0,," besides design , the only explanation of its development is blind chance , which is nonsensical .
",
3068,0,," creationism serves to explain the various mysteries of biology currently absent from the evolutionary biologists ' picture of the world .
",
3069,0,," the existence of complexity of the order found in the natural world is too great to envisage an origin other than complex design .
",
3070,0,," creationism can be drawn as an entirely reasonable scientific hypothesis , and it forms a coherent theory of the origin and development of life that opposes the naturalist theories of abiogenesis and evolution .
",
3071,0,," abiogenesis describes the development of life from nonliving materials and evolution seeks to explain the development and diversity of life through a gradual process of mutation and natural selection , yet no one has ever demonstrated either process sufficiently in the laboratory .
",
3072,0,," in the case of abiogenesis , all experiments to create an environment similar to the supposed prebiotic soup whence life first sprang have resulted in no new life forming .
",
3073,0,," in the case of evolution , evolutionists consistently fail to show the development of new kinds of organisms .
",
3074,0,," while there is no doubt that some change occurs within species , such as the breeding of wolves into dogs , it appears to happen only within certain limited bounds .
",
3075,0,," certainly no experiment or study has shown evolution to be capable of explaining such huge diversity in the world of living things .
",
3076,0,," creationism , on the other hand , offers the explanation that abiogenesis and evolution can not .
",
3077,0,," the diversity of life and its origin are rationally explicable as the product of intelligent agency .
",
3078,0,," this is not a statement of religious belief , but of scientific observation .
",
3079,0,," describing the nature of the designer , however , is another question all together , one that need not be answered in order to accept that there is such a designer .
",
3080,0,," society is made up of communities with their own views on politics , religion , education , etc, school boards should be able to set curriculum based on the desires of the public , not just on what the scientific elites command to be taught .
",
3081,0,," children deserve to hear that their beliefs and those of their community are respected in the classroom .
",
3082,0,," this is why creationism , a belief held to varying extents in many countries , should be taught in the classroom .
",
3083,0,," this is particularly true in the united states , where in several states the majority of people does not accept evolution , but have instead adopted creationism , considering the evidence for the latter to be more convincing .
",
3084,0,," in a poll ina majority ,% , said that creationism should be taught in schools either without evolution or alongside it .
",
3085,0,," the teaching of creationism should not be taught exclusively , but should share time with other prevailing theories , particularly those of evolution and abiogenesis .
",
3086,0,," furthermore , evolution taught exclusively threatens religious belief , telling children they are no more than animals and lack the spark of grace given by god .
",
3087,0,," it is important for social stability that schools are allowed to teach what communities believe to be true .
",
3088,1,,"2011 –has seen a great proliferation in moocs, or massive open online courses, which made university subjects available free of charge to anyone on the internet.
",
3089,1,," moocs are generally provided by universities, such as edx by harvard and mit, but can also include non-university partners, such as british library in futurelearn.
",
3090,1,," moocs platforms can either be specialised (as udacity for sciences) or provide a wide range of subjects (such as coursera).
",
3091,1,,"the defining feature of moocs is that their courses are free and thus provided to thousands of people.
",
3092,1,," however, moocs platforms themselves can be for-profit (coursera, udacity) or non-profit (peer-to-peer university).
",
3093,1,," for-profit platforms can raise revenue in various ways, for instance by raising venture capital [1] or charging for verified certificates [2].
",
3094,1,,"in a relatively short period of time moocs grew in massive popularity and are serving thousands and millions of users [3] [4].
",
3095,1,," some online courses have even been recommended for university credit [5].
",
3096,1,," this prompted to question whether traditional universities have to adapt themselves to the new realities of education [6] [7] and even whether they can be replaced [8].
",
3097,1,," the question of how online courses could replace universities is open for debate as well.
",
3098,0,,"  *for footnotes see bibliographythe vast popularity of moocs can be explained by the fact that people are finding it easier to learn this way .
",
3099,0,," the best feature of online learning that it can be done in the privacy of one 's home , which is more convenient than having to move cities or even countries for a university degree .
",
3100,0,," moreover , online courses are inherently more flexible .
",
3101,0,," lectures can be watched and tests taken at any time a person desires , within the deadlines , unlike with scheduled lectures and tests at the traditional university .
",
3102,0,," not only this means a more personal approach to studying , it also provides people with more flexibility to manage their other commitments , such as work and childcare .
",
3103,0,," such personal and flexible approach to learning will overtake the rigidity of the traditional university .
",
3104,0,," online courses can expand access to university education .
",
3105,0,," university education is based on the idea of merit - that the brightest people should be enabled to learn - however in real life many different circumstances play a role in one 's ability to attend university .
",
3106,0,," the result is that lots of stellar people from less-affluent backgrounds do not even apply to the best universities due to costs and anxiety involved in leaving home .
",
3107,0,," in the united states the bottompercent of the income distribution comprise justpercent of the undergraduates at top universities  .
",
3108,0,," online courses allow more bright people to go to a university by definitely removing accommodation and travel costs , and , as some predict , even by lowering or dropping tuition fees  .
",
3109,0,," this argument is made even stronger by inherent flexibility of online courses , which means that people can combine studies with work and family obligations better .
",
3110,0,," this improves access to education for the poor within the country and in particularly for those in less developed countries , which then improves meritocracy of the university system .
",
3111,0,," relocating to the best universities is a budgetary concern , but also family and social relations concern for many people , which prevents all the best people from even applying to universities that would suit them the best .
",
3112,0,," online courses can recruit students from anywhere in the world much easier than traditional universities can because students do n't need to travel far away for the best education .
",
3113,0,," this then ensures that universities have better access to the brightest people .
",
3114,0,," for instance , stanford university 's online course on artificial intelligence enabled people fromcountries to join , and none of students receiving a score ofpercent where from stanford  .
",
3115,0,," improving the pool of students would automatically result in better academics , professionals and science , which would benefit the society better .
",
3116,0,," traditional universities are forced to spend a lot on administration and facilities , such as renting and maintaining buildings and parking lots , providing student support for accommodation , renting student halls , subsiding transports costs and meals , supervising university areas and so on .
",
3117,0,," acrossus public universities the average administrative cost was about% of spending with the highest , at the university of connecticut at%  .
",
3118,0,," all these costs can be cut or abandoned all together if universities move to online teaching .
",
3119,0,," there would be no need for lecture halls and student accommodation as students would just work from home , and even professors could mostly work from home .
",
3120,0,," even if some of administrative costs remain , that would still substantially increase the amount of resources to be spent entirely on teaching and research .
",
3121,0,," this allows universities to improve their academic credentials and their academic output , which benefits the students and the society .
",
3122,0,," one of the technical features of moocs is that content of courses can easily be shared between universities and learners , as content is freely downloadable .
",
3123,0,," this is useful in two ways .
",
3124,0,," first , people who are not earning credit from the course can have full access to educational materials , which expands knowledge of those not enrolled in the university .
",
3125,0,," second , less prestigious universities can benefit by learning how to design courses better , so they can offer better services .
",
3126,0,," moocs even offer opportunities for universities to cooperate together to offer shared courses that would decrease duplication and increase quality of education  , which would be of even greater benefit to financially stressed institutions .
",
3127,0,," shared educational resources would expand access to education even further and drive educational standards higher through university cooperation .
",
3128,1,,"in some countries, like the u.k., japan, hong kong, and several african countries, school uniforms are worn in almost every school.
",
3129,1,," in other countries, like france and germany, school uniforms are only worn in a few schools, or even none.
",
3130,1,," however, in some of these countries opinions are changing.
",
3131,1,," for example, both france1 and germany2 have recently considered bringing school uniforms back, and in the u.s.a. the percentage of public schools in which children wear a uniform has increased from 11.8 in 1999-2000 to 17.5 in 2007-20083.
",
3132,1,," on the other hand, some schools in the u.k. have gotten rid of school uniforms4.
",
3133,0,," with such different rules in these different countries, it is important to think about whether or not school uniforms are really necessary, and why.
",
3134,0,,"if children are religious , they should be allowed to wear the clothes that express their religion , but school a uniform can often restrict this .
",
3135,0,," religious beliefs can be extremely valuable and important to many children , giving their lives a great deal of meaning and structure and inspiring them to work hard and behave compassionately in a school environment .
",
3136,0,," some religions place a great deal of value upon worn symbols of faith , such as turbans , headdresses and bracelets .
",
3137,0,," when a school demands that a child remove these symbols , it inadvertently attacks something central to that child 's life .
",
3138,0,," this may cause the child to see her school and her faith as mutually exclusive institutions  .
",
3139,0,," vulnerable young people should not be forced into an adversarial relationship with their school , as close , collaborative involvement with teaching and learning techniques will greatly effect a child 's ability to adapt , learn and acquire new skills in the future .
",
3140,0,," for example , school skirts are often not long enough for muslim girls , who believe that they should cover most of their bodies .
",
3141,0,," to allow children to express their religions , we should get rid of school uniforms .
",
3142,0,," rather than having school uniform , why not have a dress code instead ?
",
3143,0,," this has all the benefits of uniform without the many disadvantages .
",
3144,0,," while uniforms force all children to wear the same clothes , dress codes give students a lot of choice what to wear .
",
3145,0,," only a few unsuitable things are banned - for example , gang colors , very short skirts , crop tops , bare shoulders , etc, school uniforms are often not very comfortable or practical .
",
3146,0,," in state schools , schools for which parents do n't have to pay fees , in the u.k. , for example , girls often have to wear dresses or skirts , when they might feel more comfortable in trousers , and boys often have to wear button-up shirts and ties , which can also be uncomfortable for active children  .
",
3147,0,," in independent schools , uniforms are often even more impractical and uncomfortable , with blazers or even tailcoats for the children to wear  .
",
3148,0,," if a school has a uniform , parents are expected to buy it , and then buy a new one every time their child outgrows the last .
",
3149,0,," this can be expensive .
",
3150,0,," it has been reported that parents in south africa  , australia  , and the u.k  .
",
3151,0,," have to pay a lot of money for their children 's school uniforms , and it is probably the same in other countries too .
",
3152,0,," articleof the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ''  .
",
3153,0,," children 's freedom of expression is restricted by school uniforms , because children who have to wear the same clothing as every other child in their school are not able to express their individuality and creativity .
",
3154,0,," we should get rid of school uniform so that all children can express themselves freely .
",
3155,1,,"inturkey’s prime minister recep tayyip erdogan visited germany, surprisingly for a national leader visiting a country with a large number of turkish migrants he declared assimilation a “crime against humanity” and argued that turks in germany should study in their mother tongue, the language of one’s parents which is usually that learned from birth in the home, in schools and universities.
",
3156,1,,"large immigrant groups can be found all over the world.
",
3157,1,," the united states and canada are particularly known as immigrant nations but immigrants go elsewhere as well and there are many countries that are net recipients of migrants such the european union and it is not restricted to richer states, oman and malaysia were among countries with more immigrants than emigrants from 2008-12.
",
3158,1,," examples relevant to this debate are hispanics of mexican origin that reside in the united states, the turkish and polish population that is currently living in germany or austria and also large asian communities living in canada.
",
3159,1,,"the form of stimulating (or subsidizing) mother tongue education for large immigrant groups taken in this debate is allocating money from the national education budget to permit foreign parents that are part of such a group to build and implement school programs taught in their native language.
",
3160,1,,"a different model of implementation would change the line of reason, the advantages and disadvantages of the motion and therefore the debate.
",
3161,1,," ideas will still be valid if they are the consequence of your proposed policy.
",
3162,1,,"it is difficult to generalise about the situation of mother-tongue learning among immigrant groups.
",
3163,1,," some countries demand more integrated than others.
",
3164,1,," in europe migrants are often perceived as forming closed-circle societies with low and sometimes no interaction with people who are not immigrants, in the united states the opposite is the case and it is assumed a migrant will integrate.
",
3165,1,," in reality almost all states are somewhere between the two poles.
",
3166,1,," parents that are the first and sometimes the second generation of immigrants understandably choose to talk to their children and within the family in their mother tongue.
",
3167,1,," this phenomenon leads most of the times in children who are struggling to get education and achieve a better integration with the local people.
",
3168,0,," everyone should have the right to communicate in their own mother tongue so enabling them to maintain their roots with their mother country .
",
3169,0,," in a world of change , where people are able to move their residence from a country to another country , protecting minority rights becomes necessary .
",
3170,0,," some migrations are historically and economically driven , take place over decades , and involve large numbers .
",
3171,0,," for example , an estimated 33.7 million hispanics of mexican origin live in the united states , with 11.4 million immigrants born in mexico , accounting for almost 3.5 % of the us population .
",
3172,0,," in europe , a lot of migration there have been successive waves of migration , as a result of world war ii , the end of empires , economic boom and the european union .
",
3173,0,," to take germany first there was an influx from lands germany lost as a result of the war , of turks to help power the economic miracle meaning that now more that 2.6 million turks live in germany , and recently there has been an influx from eastern and southern europe as germany 's economy has held up in the economic crisis .
",
3174,0,," each wave , or group of immigrants , forms a distinct community within their host nation .
",
3175,0,," there is no reason why these groups should be forced to entirely give up their old identity as they embrace a new identity as a part of their host nation .
",
3176,0,," just as every human has rights so does every immigrant .
",
3177,0,," part of these rights should be education in the mother tongue .
",
3178,0,," language is what connects people and makes them able to communicate their feelings , emotions and ideas .
",
3179,0,," a person should be able to communicate and express ideas in its own mother tongue in order to be able to create a connection with their family and the immigrant community that they live in .
",
3180,0,," because parents that are immigrants teach their kids only the mother tongue , at the age in which they should go to school they barely know the local language .
",
3181,0,," their parents sometimes do n't know the language of the country that they live in and other times they choose not to use it at home .
",
3182,0,," therefore , at the age when children have to go to school , they have little or no interaction with the language of the country they live in .
",
3183,0,," in the united states ,% of immigrant families speak a language other than english at home and% live in households where no one has a strong command of the english language .
",
3184,0,," this simply hands over the problem of language to the school damaging education across all subjects .
",
3185,0,," this is because the children will not be able to communicate with other kids in school or understand what the teacher is saying .
",
3186,0,," because of the exclusion that the immigrants feel when going to school and the fact that they are not able to understand much of what is taught , they choose to leave school early .
",
3187,0,," 70 % of turkish children in germany have no general certificate of secondary education ; as they leave before completing secondary school .
",
3188,0,," by far the most sensible way to solve this problem is to send these children to a school where they do understand the language in which they are being taught .
",
3189,0,," being able to learn and teach in our own language will preserve the culture of large immigrant groups as part of another state , this is both good for that community and for the nation .
",
3190,0,," for the community and the individual speaking and learning their own language will give immigrants a sense of belonging .
",
3191,0,," they are part of a community that they know and understand because it speaks the same language even before they come to know the rest of the country .
",
3192,0,," this provides security , belonging , and close contact with relatives .
",
3193,0,," for the community it means keeping their own customs and identity alive , in a few cases this may actually be contributing to conserving a language .
",
3194,0,," for the country as a whole this does not represent a threat as there can be many different levels of identity that all intermix .
",
3195,0,," instead it provides an opportunity ; it diversifies the country .
",
3196,0,," it gains the benefit of a different perspective on problems and new ideas as people who speak different languages think about things in different ways so it is useful for innovation to have many different communities brought up in different languages interacting .
",
3197,0,," it also gains from having another culture add diversity to its own ; there are new festivals , concerts , art , and perhaps most commonly encountered a greater diversity of cuisines to be sampled through restaurants .
",
3198,0,," if the government decides to promote mother tongue education for large immigrant groups it will be enhancing mutual understanding between its own population and another nation as the immigrants provide a go between .
",
3199,0,," the state will send a positive message towards the large immigrant groups by allowing them to study in their first language .
",
3200,0,," it will acknowledge the importance of such groups in the national society by providing this additional opportunity .
",
3201,0,," the importance of cooperation between immigrant groups and the state is often recognized , for example in combating extremism , this kind of measure encourages such cooperation as it brings with it the good will of the immigrant community .
",
3202,0,," on the other hand , promoting diversity will promote understanding between countries .
",
3203,0,," a favorable treatment towards the large immigrant groups will be seen positively by the country the immigrants come from .
",
3204,0,," having migrants creates a link between the two countries .
",
3205,0,," this may produce clear advantages for both parties , in the form of collaboration , diplomacy and trade .
",
3206,0,," the effect of migrants on trade is often ignored but studies have shown that in the case of spain from 1995-2008 exports are boosted by having immigrant communities ; `` doubling the number of immigrants from a certain country in a province leads to an increase of the export values from the destination province to the country of the immigrants ' origin by around% . ''
",
3207,0,," the reason was because new exporting firms are created -- immigrants know the conditions in their own country so can access that market , something that would be impossible without a native understanding of the language .
",
3208,1,,"national testing of schools requires schools to test their children every year to measure how much they have learned.
",
3209,1,," the government only gives money to schools which do the testing.
",
3210,1,," the goal of national testing is to compare students in different schools and give extra money to those schools with students who are not doing as well.
",
3211,1,," there are also penalties for principles of schools who have done badly for several years.
",
3212,1,," parents at failing schools also have the right to move their children to a different school .
",
3213,1,," many people believe national testing is wrong and will not achieve its aim.
",
3214,1,," they argue that teachers and parents should be trusted with control of schools, not the government.
",
3215,1,," others argue that the only way to know how schools and students are performing is to compare them against schools and students elsewhere in the country.
",
3216,0,," some people nevertheless want national testing, so that all children sit the same test regardless of where they live, as they do in countries like the uk and france.
",
3217,0,,"national testing will result in teachers `` teaching to the test '' .
",
3218,0,," students will be taught how to take tests instead of learning skills and knowledge that will help them become good citizens .
",
3219,0,," this is because teachers will be judged based on how well their students do at tests , not on other important things like whether they are better behaved , more confident or learning faster .
",
3220,0,," as charles murray describes , his children 's school lost their best english teacher because he said ' i want to teach my students how to write ... not teach them how to pass a test that says they can write ' .
",
3221,0,," with national testing , they will become good test takers but will miss out on the joy of learning for learning 's sake .
",
3222,0,," subjects like art and music that are not covered on the national tests could be cut so that more time can be spent teaching students to pass the test .
",
3223,0,," children 's education would become focused on a yearly test .
",
3224,0,," any system of standardized testing , where everyone is given the same test , assumes that all students learn at the same rate .
",
3225,0,," but this is not the case .
",
3226,0,," talented students and un-talented students should not be measured by the same test .
",
3227,0,," handing down a standard national test from the top is bound to end up with a `` one-size-fits-all '' result that does n't suit the weakest or the best students .
",
3228,0,," in the united kingdom , national testing was introduced in.
",
3229,0,," by,% of students at the best schools got the top grade , whilst 300,000 of the united kingdom 's worst pupils failed to pass .
",
3230,0,," the national test ` has not only become too easy for the academically able , but it is still too difficult for the bottomper cent , who cry out for ... courses to help them make sense of their last three years of compulsory schooling ' .
",
3231,0,," a ` one-size-fits-all ' national test does not adequately measure the ability of the student , and fails to motivate students in their education .
",
3232,0,," the best students find them too easy , the worst students find them too difficult .
",
3233,1,,"this discussion starts from the point of view that sexual education classes should be given at schools.
",
3234,1,," but does this mean that so-called “safe sex” should also be promoted within these lessons?
",
3235,1,," safe sex is the practice of sexual activity in a manner that reduces the risk of infection with sexually transmitted diseases (stds) such as chlamydia and hiv/aids, typically by use of condoms.
",
3236,1,," safe sex also includes sexual practices that do not involve penetration.
",
3237,1,,"traditionally sexual education lessons have focused on covering the biological facts about human reproduction, and warnings against unsafe sexual practices.
",
3238,1,," often today sex education is combined with relationships education, in an attempt to place sex in a broader emotional, social and family context.
",
3239,1,," but now every day more and more people talk about “safe sex” and how teenagers should be more informed about protection against stds.
",
3240,1,,"despite the worries some people have about whether sex should ever be seen as entirely risk-free, every day this so-called ""safe sex"" is promoted more and more as a solution for the epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases amongst teenagers.
",
3241,1,," but what if the promotion of ""safe sex"" has the opposite effect for which it was introduced in sexual education classes?
",
3242,1,,"  inthe proportion of british 16-19 year olds who had had unprotected sex rose to 26% and 45% did not consider themselves to be well informed about contraception.
",
3243,1,," opponents argue that today sexual education and promoting safe sex are mostly considered the same thing, while it isn't and shouldn't be.
",
3244,1,," they say it is one thing to inform teenagers about sex and its risks, and quite another to promote and encourage them to use ""safe sex"" as prevention.
",
3245,1,,"other issues include whether parents should have the ability to ‘opt-out’ of sex education for their children – or indeed whether the children themselves should be able to opt-out; whether or not sex education should be done with a particular focus (such as promotion of abstinence); and whether or not faith schools should be compelled to teach elements of a sex-education syllabus (such as on homosexual relationships) which run contrary to their beliefs.
",
3246,0,," the spread of aids in the 80s and 90s showed that education and information is more important than ever as exemplified by the slogan in the british's advertising campaign to prevent aids ` aids : do n't die of ignorance ' .
",
3247,0,," the campaigns were credited with credited with changing behaviour through warnings on adverts and informing through an information leaflet .
",
3248,0,," this shows that education can work even when starting from scratch .
",
3249,0,," giving sex education in schools is crucial to the spread of information to each successive generation , and may be supplemented by frank discussion at home .
",
3250,0,," young people express their sexuality as part of their development to adulthood .
",
3251,0,," it is not having sex that is a problem , but having unsafe sex or hurting people through sexual choices .
",
3252,0,," refusing to promote safe sex would mean not moving with the times .
",
3253,0,," just because schools do not promote safe sex does not mean that adolescents will not experiment with sex .
",
3254,0,," they will already be exposed to sexual imagery and ideas of sex so it is necessary that they are taught properly how to remain safe .
",
3255,0,," schools may also want to talk about abstinence at the same time ; it is a way of keeping sexually safe .
",
3256,0,," however schools have to recognise that the majority of pupils are unlikely to stick to abstinence regardless of how much the school promotes it .
",
3257,0,," it is therefore necessary for the school to also promote and educate about safe sex .
",
3258,0,," the internet provides a vast amount of easily accessible information about sex , of varying degrees of quality .
",
3259,0,," most children in the west now have access to the internet and are therefore likely to have access to this information on sex , or at least educational materials on sex even if the child 's access to the internet is controlled .
",
3260,0,," given that it is impossible to prevent children from accessing this information if they really want to , it makes sense to present it to them in an organised and accurate fashion .
",
3261,0,," rather than allowing children to find information on their own through what may well be unreliable resources it is necessary that they should get good reliable information .
",
3262,0,," that this information when there is safe sex education comes from the school means that the children know that they information is reliable .
",
3263,0,," they can then use this information to help them decide how reliable any further information they may find from other sources is .
",
3264,0,," with the age of consent beingand with young people being able to vote at, it does not make sense for parents to have control over whether their children attended sex education classes right up until the age ofor whenever they finish full time schooling .
",
3265,0,," the age of consent means that there is clearly a need to be taught about sex from that age of consent .
",
3266,0,," this is something that can not be guaranteed to happen in all individual households if left to the parents whereas it can be ensured in schools .
",
3267,1,,"all countries have mathematics as a key part of the curriculum for young children.
",
3268,1,," most education systems teach maths for quite a bit longer than that.
",
3269,1,," in the uk, mathematics is compulsory up to gcse level (age 16) while in the usa it is often taught to the end of high school.
",
3270,1,,"however, maths is a subject which people often complain about.
",
3271,1,," it shows up in almost every collection of “most hated subjects.”
",
3272,1,," and also in more professional polling where 37% of adults admit to having hated maths at school.
",
3273,1,," many criticisms are levelled at it, including being boring and not being useful.
",
3274,1,,"basic arithmetic is an essential life skill, which we use literally every day – prices, times etc. any reasonable education system should include this.
",
3275,1,," but it is not far-fetched to say that most children will have learnt this by about 15.
",
3276,1,," that being the case, imagine a proposal to stop all compulsory mathematics lessons after that age.
",
3277,1,," is this a good idea?
",
3278,0,," maths is one of the least engaging subjects taught at school .
",
3279,0,," subjects like chemistry are full of flashes , fires and experiments which help people see what they 're being taught in front of them .
",
3280,0,," history starts with telling stories , and even though that 's not what the subject is really about , it offers a window into it .
",
3281,0,," by contrast , maths has almost nothing similar .
",
3282,0,," asking children to use trigonometry to find the height of a tree does not fool them -- all they see is another triangle .
",
3283,0,," some people enjoy it , but many do not .
",
3284,0,," forcing people through maths classes which they find boring and irrelevant will only put them off maths ; a recent study found that motivation was the most important factor for improving maths grades .
",
3285,0,," this in turn makes their children less likely to study maths , and causes a cycle in which a large section of the population have as little to do with maths as they can .
",
3286,0,," it would be much better to not make these people study maths .
",
3287,0,," true , they would end up not knowing any more than the bare essentials , but this is better than making them hate it .
",
3288,0,," it is a fundamental principle of education that different people think in different ways .
",
3289,0,," one notable application of this is the theory of different learning styles , and it also makes people have a preference for certain subjects .
",
3290,0,," many people find maths hard ,% of teens think it is the most difficult subject , for a variety of reasons -- it simply is n't suited to all minds .
",
3291,0,," another fundamental principle is that all children are equal , in the sense that we should support them equally in helping them find the right opportunities .
",
3292,0,," it follows that we should teach them something useful and relevant to their personality and preferences .
",
3293,0,," but whatever that may turn out to be , it will not be maths , and maths would just waste their time .
",
3294,0,," it makes sense to teach arithmetic to even these people , but there is no need to make them study further .
",
3295,0,," schools are constantly pressed for time , money and staff .
",
3296,0,," it is simply not possible to teach everything to everyone .
",
3297,0,," this means that all of education is a balancing act .
",
3298,0,," we try and isolate the most important parts of a subject and teach children what they need to know , but first , we have to isolate which subjects are important .
",
3299,0,," so , for example , we teach history rather than philosophy and physics rather than astronomy .
",
3300,0,," everything we teach therefore comes at the expense of not teaching something else and there are already some countries that choose other priorities ; france for example prioritises philosophy .
",
3301,0,," taking time away from maths has two advantages .
",
3302,0,," firstly , means we can teach other subjects instead , which will be more useful , such as dedicated classes on writing , or debating .
",
3303,0,," secondly , we can spend longer on those subjects which we already teach , making them better .
",
3304,0,," as a bonus , we could even use this time to extend science lessons to include whatever maths is necessary , meaning we do n't lose out at all .
",
3305,1,,"in many countries, school attendance is mandatory for all children up to a specific age.
",
3306,1,," children often then have the choice of staying on at school for further education and possible preparation for university or college entrance, or leaving to pursue a job or professional training.
",
3307,1,," in india this isyears of age: in the uk and many other countries it is 16, although the uk government now has plans to raise the school leaving age to 18.
",
3308,1,,"  school leaving ages are often linked to when young people are seen to become adults in their society, because the state would rather not compel adults to do what they do not want to do.
",
3309,1,," however, there is often some grey area between when children are granted some privileges (for example the right to smoke, have sex or learn to drive) but not all rights (i.e. the right to vote).
",
3310,1,," in most countries young people can choose to leave school at least two years before they are considered mature enough to vote.
",
3311,1,," economists are also divided over the effect of young workers in the workforce as opposed to the benefits of increased skills levels among the workforce.
",
3312,0,," while school based education is usually taken to mean academic subjects it may also involve vocational training within a school or college environment.
",
3313,0,,"more education provides the opportunity to acquire more skills and therefore more options .
",
3314,0,," it has been shown many times that those with more education find it easier to find work and that they are more likely to find that work satisfying .
",
3315,0,," similarly , the level of education among the population can have a positive effect on the economy as a whole as they can be more efficient workers .
",
3316,0,," the impact of extra years of education on earnings and economic productivity is also disproportionately heavy at the lower end - that is , two more years at school for ayear old will make a much greater percentage difference to their later economic worth than two years of graduate work for ayear old .
",
3317,0,," the uk has recently raised the school leaving age tofor the same reasons .
",
3318,0,," doing so increases the economic potential of the future workforce , and so will bring increased tax revenues in the long term to more than cover any initial costs .
",
3319,0,," although some countries would experience a more dramatic change than others , it is worth noting that in many states a very large majority of young people voluntarily stay in education beyond the end of compulsory schooling , e.g. france , germany and japan .
",
3320,0,," in the ukper cent of pupils in yearstated that they had intentions to stay on in further education .
",
3321,0,," if these countries can already bear the extra cost without economic collapse , it should be possible for others to cope as well .
",
3322,0,," ensuring everyone gets educated for the same amount of time at school should promote equality .
",
3323,0,," currently early-school leaving is linked with other indicators of socio-economic disadvantage , such as low-income jobs or high unemployment .
",
3324,0,," more importantly parents who left school young and as a consequence have lower-grade occupations are more likely to have children who leave school early , only% of those children stay in education past.
",
3325,0,," forcing all children to stay in school longer could break this cycle of disadvantage .
",
3326,1,,"the question of the best way to raise children is one which is widely debated in all liberal democracies.
",
3327,1,," it is also commonly believed that decisions regarding childcare should be left to parents in the private sphere of the home.
",
3328,1,," typically, states become involved in questions concerning parenting only when there have been serious failings on the part of parents - such as cases of abuse or neglect.
",
3329,1,," however, given the increasing concern over bad behaviour in schools, youth crime, substance abuse and a perceived lack of respect for society on behalf of young people, questions may be raised as to whether unaided parents have the competence required to raise children and whether they should enjoy absolute freedom when raising their children.
",
3330,1,," a radical proposal is to require that people who want to become parents obtain a licence (just as they do before if they want to drive a car).
",
3331,1,," how this measure would be implemented in the case of natural reproduction (as opposed to adoption, custody, or assisted reproduction) is controversial.
",
3332,1,,"parenting classes are a possible solution to assist new parents and parents who encounter difficulties in raising their children.
",
3333,1,," should classes be offered on a voluntary basis or made compulsory for all prospective parents?
",
3334,1,," is the state justified in using preventive measures or should it intervene only when problems occur?
",
3335,1,," at present no state requires compulsory classes for all would-be parents, but the british government has shown interest in “early intervention” strategies including parenting classes for families where children are thought likely to grow up posing problems for society.
",
3336,1,," one interesting proposal is that the state can offer parenting classes to all children in school as part of their compulsory education.
",
3337,1,," this measure would make people aware at a very early stage of their education of the skills and knowledge base required to deal effectively with children.
",
3338,0,,"the arguments below concern the proposal to make parenting classes compulsory to all would-be parents, and the proposal to offer specific parenting classes to parents who experience problems in raising their children.
",
3339,0,,"parenting classes would need to be compulsory for a number of reasons .
",
3340,0,," firstly - for all of the subjectivity regarding parenting -- there are clearly some cases where bad parenting is responsible for some of the child 's failings .
",
3341,0,," a morbidly obeseyear old with a criminal record , no school qualifications and poor health has , almost certainly , been let down by his or her parents .
",
3342,0,," however the state has no way of knowing in advance as to which parents will struggle in this manner -- hence it is better if the classes are for everyone .
",
3343,0,," furthermore , it seems fair to assume that parents who are somehow socially excluded , wilfully ignorant or suffering some other acute difficulty in raising children , would probably be less likely to take the active step of attending voluntary classes in the first place .
",
3344,0,," according to a report on uk children 's services referral to get help tends to be self-referral by those who have less need whereas those with higher needs have to be referred by others before they will accept the helpthus voluntary classes may actually be structurally biased to miss the cases in which they are most needed .
",
3345,0,," a compulsory system is likely to offer far better outcomes across society the state has a strong moral , practical and financial interest in the raising of its future citizens .
",
3346,0,," this is why most liberal democracies offer extensive and costly child support systems , including child-support payments , free nursery care , parental leave arrangements , to aid parents in raising young people who can be active and respectful members of society .
",
3347,0,," louise casey , government respect co-ordinator , argues that the best results come from preventative action : `` i think we have got to do everything to make sure we are tackling not just anti-social behaviour today , but preventing the next generation of people growing up with signs of anti-social behaviour in the future . ''
",
3348,0,," 1 compulsory parenting classes could be a means to ensure the cohesion and prosperity of its future generations by raising the standard of parenting they receive .
",
3349,0,," in our times , when contraception is widely available and affordable , reproduction should be an active and responsible choice on the part of individuals .
",
3350,0,," parenting classes would be instrumental in ensuring that people reflect upon their decision to have children and understand the implications of their choice.
",
3351,0,,"moreover , if the ` lifestyle choice ' of having children is supported by the state , through tax breaks , benefits and entitlements , then it would seem that the state is justified in applying some minimal conditions to people who wish to benefit from its support .
",
3352,0,," so parenting classes would be a means for the state to safeguard its interest in having responsible citizens .1 currently , information about parenting is scarce , patchy and inconsistent .
",
3353,0,," it would benefit all if up-to-date parenting information provided by medical staff , psychologists , nutritionists , educators and so on , were made accessible and standardised : all parents would receive the same basic and essential information .
",
3354,0,," and information is always valuable and often appreciated by those who receive it .
",
3355,0,," the charity barnardo 's argues that those who attended their classes ` were unanimously positive about the impact of courses and were clear that attending them provided them with new skills and confidence in their parenting ability . '
",
3356,0,," 1parenting classes would provide up-to-date and standardized information useful to guide prospective parents ' behaviour and it would not amount to imposing one model of parenting on all .
",
3357,1,,"this is an idea that has been floated by some education reform advocates (mainly conservatives) who believe that the problem of childhood discipline in the classroom cannot be remedied unless parents themselves are acting at home to engender good disciplinary habits in their children.
",
3358,1,,"  the idea was briefly enacted in both florida and michigan.
",
3359,1,,"  in florida small fines were imposed on parents and in michigan coveted parking permits were suspended when children misbehaved.
",
3360,1,,"  both programs were promptly discontinued due to parental outcry.
",
3361,1,," in the united kingdom there have been cases of parents being jailed for failing to stop their children being truant from school.
",
3362,1,,"future iterations of this idea in the united states may involve charter schools where parents of children with track records of disciplinary problems voluntarily enrol their children in a school with such a contract.
",
3363,1,,"  charter schools can state explicit requirements of students in terms of behaviour in their charter which can then be legally enforced.
",
3364,1,," modelling the debate in this fashion may help avoid some of the parental consent issues of the debate, although it is by no means necessary for proposition to take this strategy in the debate.
",
3365,1,," another version of this debate is to hold parents liable for the criminal actions of children during school going years.
",
3366,1,,"  for instance, if a child is caught shop lifting, one might impose a fine on the parents in addition to punishment handed down to the child.
",
3367,1,,"  some of the arguments below are tailored more specifically to this version of the debate, although the arguments considered can be modified to fit into either debate.
",
3368,1,,"  the assumption behind this brief is that by and large the children being discussed are those with chronic discipline problems.
",
3369,0,,"  addressing the behavioural problems of children requires active parental participation .
",
3370,0,," however , in many cases , parents are either not fully aware of their children 's problems , or more importantly , delay the active disciplining of their children .
",
3371,0,," this is critical , as for the cycle of negative and positive reinforcement to be effective in behaviour modification , there must be a temporal link between misbehaviour and any potential punishment .
",
3372,0,," in a desire to avoid future fines , or whatever the penalty the parents face , there is an active incentive to not only intervene in the child 's misbehaviour , but also to do so in a timely way , which is the most proven way to change children 's behaviour .
",
3373,0,," moreover , if there is any tendency for parents to overlook or avoid the problems of chronically unruly children , this serves as an impetus for keeping up with discipline notices and paying attention to the child 's infractions .
",
3374,0,," a lack of parental involvement has for example regularly been cited as being partially to blame for the riots in the uk during august.
",
3375,0,," in order for a child 's misbehaviour to be successfully remedied , the child must receive a consistent message on what is appropriate both at home and at school .
",
3376,0,," in many instances parents may condone behaviour that schools and teacher find unacceptable .
",
3377,0,," in other instances , professionals at schools can aid parents in targeting specific behaviours to work on in a specific order in a program that integrates the child 's behaviour at both school and home .
",
3378,0,," moreover , uniform and consistent rewards and negative reinforcements from school and home are tremendously useful for helping rehabilitate a child 's behaviour .
",
3379,0,," when initiating such programs , the major problem is often that the parents give in and do not adhere to the agreed upon program , which serves to teach the child that unacceptable behaviour is sometimes condonable .
",
3380,0,," it 's understandable that parents , who must be with the children a majority of the time , sometimes may find it easier to simply give in and pacify the child and inadvertently award destructive behaviour .
",
3381,0,," therefore , a system of parental investment , as proposed here , will ensure that the parents have something riding on sticking to a disciplinary program as well , which ultimately aids the child .
",
3382,0,," in the case of parents being penalized for criminal offenses by children , one can modify this argument to fit by noting that often juvenile facilities will use schools as part of a behavioural modification program , therefore the consistency noted above is still critical .
",
3383,0,," often , children who have been trapped in a cycle of lack of discipline and disciplinary problems tend not to care about their punishment .
",
3384,0,," detention may be seen as a welcome respite from classes , and other punishments over time may cease to make an impression on the child .
",
3385,0,," after all , there is only so much that an institution can do to discipline a child .
",
3386,0,," using this mechanism opens up a far more effective repertoire of discipline .
",
3387,0,," more importantly , while the child may cease to regard any punishments handed down on him or her , often there will still be a desire to avoid actively harming the parents , which occurs under this system .
",
3388,0,," the argument also extends in the case of criminal punishments .
",
3389,0,," in the psychology of a child , he or she may not fully internalize the effects on their future a shoplifting arrest may have .
",
3390,0,," however , the thought of their parents being punished in such an offense may lead to the deterrence necessary to prevent such actions .
",
3391,0,," in effect , the argument is that when punishments to the child him or herself fail to act as a deterrent , the child seeing punishments imposed on the parents as a result of his or her actions may reinvigorate the deterrent effect .
",
3392,0,," in addition , this allows an extra tool in the teacher 's arsenal , and the mere thought of perhaps `` triggering '' a parental punishment may help bring some children into line .
",
3393,0,," in most cases , in which the child is not subject to some sort of constitutional problem , genetic condition or otherwise , the disruptive behaviour of a child is a reflection of in adequate parental intervention over time .
",
3394,0,," a normal child under normal circumstances should be expected to conform to behavioural expectations , and the failure to do so represents a partial inadequate job by the parents .
",
3395,0,," the result is a cost that is transmitted to society .
",
3396,0,," children that are disruptive in school or in society via the criminal justice system cost the system extra money either in school resources and time or judicial-police resources as well as in the more obvious costs such as fixing vandalism and graffiti .
",
3397,0,," even worse ; if a student drops out as a result of his discipline problems the cost to society has been estimated as $ 232,000-388 ,000 .
",
3398,0,," given that the parent is in part to blame for failing to control the child 's behaviour , in the time during which the parent is the primary custodian of the child , it is fair to pass on a measure of this cost to the parent .
",
3399,1,,"the seychelles are an archipelago in the indian ocean, northeast of madagascar.
",
3400,1,," it is one of the smallest countries in the world at onlykm2, its population is also comparatively small at only 90,000.
",
3401,1,," many of the islands that make up the country are flat reefs, though not all – its highest point is 905m above sea level.
",
3402,1,," as with many other small island states around the world, particularly maldives, kiribati, and tuvalu the whole country is under threat from climate change.
",
3403,1,," unlike tuvalu and kiribati the problem is not simply sea level rise meaning the whole country could end up underwater; unlike those island states the country does have some higher ground.
",
3404,1,," instead the problem is that the remaining land will become uninhabitable.
",
3405,1,," there is some sea level rise, but the problem is as much about erosion as a result of more intense storms, and higher and stronger tides.
",
3406,1,,"percent of the population lives on the coast but moving into the higher areas is not an option as the country would be left with few resources and almost no fresh water supply.
",
3407,1,,"so far no country has ceased to exist as a result of climate change.
",
3408,1,," yet it has become increasingly clear that climate change talks are not going to result in deep and fast enough cuts in emissions to prevent some sea level rise so the position of the small island states will increasingly become untenable as their islands become uninhabitable.
",
3409,1,," the search is therefore on for solutions.
",
3410,1,," the most obvious scenario is that these states will simple cease to exist and their people will become climate refugees.
",
3411,1,," there have been some immense estimates that there could bemillion climate refugees by– but even if this were to happen the vast majority would be internal refugees, and not members of a disappearing state.
",
3412,1,," thus there may well be 20million refugees as a result of parts of bangladesh being underwater but bangladesh would still exist – those refugees would still have other areas of the country where they could go.
",
3413,1,," the citizens of the small island states would be in a different situation as the nation they are citizens of would no longer exist; instead they would probably have to be taken in by neighbours although this might prove problematic because the refugee convention does not cover victims of natural disasters.
",
3414,1,,"traditionally the four elements of statehood are having a defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.
",
3415,1,," climate change threatens to damage the defined territory to the point that the second is no longer possible.
",
3416,1,," this in turn is likely to jeopardise an effective government.
",
3417,1,," only the last criterion is not initially under threat.
",
3418,1,," so how might a state maintain these criteria when its defined territory is disappearing?
",
3419,1,," the proposal would be that the seychelles should buy, or otherwise acquire, territory from another bigger state.
",
3420,1,," this state would cede some, or all, sovereignty over this territory.
",
3421,1,," the territory would probably be a similar size or possibly if less economically viable slightly bigger than the current territory.
",
3422,1,," ideally the ceded territory would be islands or coastal so that the current skills of the people of the seychelles are still relevant.
",
3423,1,," given the small size of the state it is likely uninhabited land could be found.
",
3424,1,," however any current inhabitants would be allowed to remain, with the possibility that their current state might maintain sovereignty over them.
",
3425,1,,"n.b. the arguments here could be used for any small state that is going to no longer exist as a result of climate change.
",
3426,1,,"allowing the current natives to remain, and for the possibility of contiguous sovereignty by two states over the same territory, opens up a lot of questions that have not been sufficiently explored here.
",
3427,1,," the alternative that they be expelled, citizenship, or essentially become migrants however would make any deal much less likely to be acceptable.
",
3428,0,," it is clear that if the seychelles wishes to remain as a sovereign nation it will have to relocate almost all of its population and it makes sense for this to be in one place so keeping the nation together .
",
3429,0,," the way to do this is through purchasing land and sovereignty from another country that has land to spare .
",
3430,0,," there is clearly little other choice and some of the small island states have already accepted this .
",
3431,0,," kiribati for example has already bought land from fiji with the intent of using it as a last resort for its people .
",
3432,0,," the seychelles , as with the other nations whose very existence is threatened by climate change , is small .
",
3433,0,," it is twice the size of washington d.c. , so smaller than many cities .
",
3434,0,," as such finding enough land to relocate the country should not be a problem .
",
3435,0,," several of the states closest to the seychelles ; kenya , tanzania , somalia , and madagascar , have plenty of land that they could give up without any inconvenience to their own state .
",
3436,0,," kenya , the smallest , is more thantimes bigger than seychelles .
",
3437,0,," if there are no countries willing to cede complete sovereignty over territory then some kind of shared sovereignty could be considered .
",
3438,0,," `` this conferred jurisdiction must include rights to become a citizen , migrate , work , access health care , and access social security . ''
",
3439,0,," additionally there would almost certainly need to be sovereignty over justice , law and order .
",
3440,0,," however this would potentially leave large areas of sovereignty in the remit of the host nation ; such as providing defense .
",
3441,0,," the most notable compromise by both might be to maintain sovereignty over people rather than just territory .
",
3442,0,," there have been suggestions such as by krasner that shared sovereignty should be considered , and become much more normal .
",
3443,0,," and some forms of shared sovereignty have happened before such as foreign control over some tax revenues , or the status of forces agreements the usa had with germany that restricted german ability to make war after wwii .
",
3444,0,," or more obviously the members of the eu increasingly cede some sovereignty to the international entity .
",
3445,0,," as the deal would be voluntary for both the seychelles and its host country and both would potentially gain such a deal would seem feasible .
",
3446,0,," the president of vanuatu has noted `` if such a tragedy , the disappearance of a state , should happen , then the united nations and its members will have failed in their first and most basic duty to a member and its innocent people , as stated in articleof the charter of the united nations . ''
",
3447,0,," as long ago asdeveloped nations accepted `` the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit to sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command '' and that `` polluter should , in principle , bear the cost of pollution '' .
",
3448,0,," there is also a convention on the reduction of statelessness in which articledemands that any redrawing of borders must not render a person stateless , the principle behind which would equally apply to a disappearing state .
",
3449,0,," the small island states are losing their countries through no fault of their own it is therefore the responsibility of other states to provide them with alternatives ; be this land or the resources to purchase land .
",
3450,1,,"the latest report (fifth) from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) put the blame for climate change firmly on humanity.
",
3451,1,," the chair of the working group on physical science notes “we give very relevant guidance on the total amount of carbon that can't be emitted to stay to 1.5 or 2⁰c. we are not on the path that would lead us to respect that warming target” leading to the un secretary general stating “the heat is on.
",
3452,1,," we must act.”
",
3453,1,," past experience however shows they won’t.
",
3454,1,,"the most obvious alternative is to accept that climate change is coming and to begin preparing for it.
",
3455,1,," adaptation is “adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.”
",
3456,1,," adaptation is often thought of being purely physical; building higher sea walls and more resilient infrastructure.
",
3457,1,," but it is much more than that including “diversification of livelihood activities, institutions both formal and informal, adjustments in farming operations… seasonal forecasts… having adequate grain reserves, weather insurance, food price subsidies” etc. this means that adaptation can mean anything from new methods of farming to migrating to areas that are going to see more, not less rainfall.
",
3458,1,,"however any such adaptation is going to be costly so the question of ‘who pays?’
",
3459,1,," is as prominent in adaptation as it was in reducing emissions.
",
3460,1,," in the doha summit ofprime minister hailemariam of ethiopia pointed out that rather than new pledges “we are going to push especially for the powerful countries to implement previous decisions.”
",
3461,1,," the green climate fund is supposed to receive $100billion per year bybut funding is barely reaching $10billion per year.
",
3462,1,," there is no way to force countries to stump up funds to help others prevent the effects of climate change but should the developed world consider itself obliged to meet its obligations and fund adaptation, particularly for the poorest and hardest hit such as africa?
",
3463,0,," lives are already being lost to climate change ; a report by climate vulnerability monitor estimates that already almost 5million are lost per year to climate change , even without the distorting numbers from pollution there are 400,000 deaths per year .
",
3464,0,," while attributing individual events to climate change is difficult research by climate scientists suggests that the lack long rains in somalia in earlyis betweenand% the result of greenhouse gasses .
",
3465,0,," this famine has killed betweenandthousand people .
",
3466,0,," with lives being lost the urgency of funding adaptation to reduce these loses is clear .
",
3467,0,," a report by the united nations environmental project estimates that adaptation costs to africa per year could already be $ 15billion , reach $ 50billion byand anything up to $ 350billion by.
",
3468,0,," funding for adaptation to africa inwas only $ 454milliion .
",
3469,0,," this is not a gap that africa can make up itself ; inall spending on education was less than $ 50billion .
",
3470,0,," africa ca n't afford to adapt itself while responding to an expanding population as well as its existing problems of poverty and disease .
",
3471,0,," it is clear that developed countries that do have the resources have to step it and take responsibility .
",
3472,0,," the ipcc says that it is `` extremely likely '' that human activities are the cause of the temperature rise .
",
3473,0,," this means the biggest historical emitters have a responsibility to pay for the consequences .
",
3474,0,," fromtothe united states produced 314,772 million metric tonnes of co2 compared to china 's 89,243 million metric tonnes and while india now produces more co2 germany over the same period emitted three times as much .
",
3475,0,," history matters as much of the co2 remains in the atmosphere for decades or hundreds of years .
",
3476,0,," it is the responsibility of those who caused the problem to protect innocents from the fallout of their actions .
",
3477,0,," the ipcc starts its chapter on africa `` africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate change and climate variability '' .
",
3478,0,," it is also the poorest continent in the world so least able to cope .
",
3479,0,," in the gain index by the global adaptation institute which measures vulnerability and readiness for climate change eight of the bottom ten are african states .
",
3480,0,," the changes to africa could be dramatic ;% of wildlife habitats could disappear , crop yields fall by% despite already being the lowest in the world andmillion are at risk of flooding as sea levels rise .
",
3481,0,," if anywhere needs help from developed countries in adaptation it is africa .
",
3482,0,," many of the areas of adaptation are areas where the west has the relevant expertise ; seasonal forecasting , adjusting farming -- perhaps by engineering hardier plants , weather insurance etc, africa does not have experience or experts in many of the relevant areas , for example africa lags behind in bioscience , so it makes sense for the west to provide these experts .
",
3483,0,," and while they do so the west might as well also pay the cost of these expertise and also provide the necessary skills education and training to overcome these problems .
",
3484,1,,"nuclear energy is one of the main sources of energy in today’s european union.
",
3485,1,," currentlyeu countries use nuclear power plants to produce electrical energy.
",
3486,1,," togetherpower plant blocks are deployed with total output of more thangw.
",
3487,1,," the produced energy of these plants covers 28.5% of eu’s energy consumption as of 2010.
",
3488,1,," nuclear power plants are therefore currently a vital component in providing the eu with electric energy.
",
3489,1,," however, after the fukushima accident inmany started calling for the end of nuclear energy in the eu, thus adding to the discussion started long ago as a result of worries about nuclear disasters and nuclear waste.
",
3490,1,," for instance germany in direct response to fukushima accident decided to speed up its planned phase out nuclear power plants by 2022.
",
3491,1,," in the uk on the other hand in octoberagreed the construction of the uk’s first new nuclear power plant in twenty years and there may be more to come.
",
3492,1,," the question of what to do with nuclear energy in the european union is therefore a current debate that affects countries all over the union.
",
3493,1,," in this debate we will look upon arguments in favour and against closing all nuclear power plants in the eu and substituting them with other forms of energy production.
",
3494,1,," of course this cannot be done overnight, thus we are dealing with long-term time frame (about a decade).
",
3495,0,," while nuclear power it is often proclaimed as clean this does not mean it is a renewable resource like wind , wave , or solar power .
",
3496,0,," nuclear power plants use uranium to produce energy , which , of course , needs to be mined .
",
3497,0,," currently only 2.3 % of uranium used in reactors in eu is mined in the eu .
",
3498,0,," moreover , the world 's main uranium deposits are located outside the eu .
",
3499,0,," the use of nuclear energy thus undermines energy self-sufficiency of the eu .
",
3500,0,," this may pose a serious threat to the future .
",
3501,0,," natural , and other , resources are usually used as the first intermediates of diplomatic disputes .
",
3502,0,," when a country wants to exert diplomatic pressure on another country , or bloc of countries like eu , trade bans or embargos are widely used .
",
3503,0,," for example inrussia stopped gas supply to ukraine due to trade dispute between their two national gas companies .
",
3504,0,," therefore , the supply of uranium may be susceptible to diplomatic and trade relations , which are often volatile , and consequently nuclear power may not be reliable .
",
3505,0,," is it one of the aims of the eu to become less dependent on imported material needed for energy production .
",
3506,0,," as a non renewable resource we also need to think about the possibility of supplies running out .
",
3507,0,," the concept of ` peak uranium ' is sometimes overblown but there is only ayears supply of uranium at current consumption rates .
",
3508,0,," if the price gets high enough then there are other options for production , including from seawater , but this would clearly mean a big increase in cost and concerns that producers will try to keep cheaper uranium to themselves and export for much higher prices .
",
3509,0,," thus over longer term the nuclear energy may become far more expensive , or even unavailable due to lack of fuel .
",
3510,0,," in order not to harm environment , not to cause climate changes , renewable power plants , wind , water , solar , should be used .
",
3511,0,," however , these do not work together with nuclear power plants .
",
3512,0,," nuclear plants -- giant very hot machines -- are designed to operate at full speed ,% , all the time .
",
3513,0,," they are not designed to change the output quickly .
",
3514,0,," since they are very expensive to build , they are not economic unless operated at full speed , also turning off and on is expensive .
",
3515,0,," solar and wind power plants are not stable , output varies because of natural factors , and thus need a backup , called a baseload .
",
3516,0,," nuclear plants are not a good backup for renewables .
",
3517,0,," we need nimble plants in order to support wind and solar plants .
",
3518,0,," nuclear power stations do not work with solar , wind and water power stations , because they are running at full speed all the time , because of economic and technical reasons .
",
3519,0,," instead gas plants that can be powered up and down as required are needed to balance power generation .
",
3520,0,," if we want to move towards green world -- nuclear energy does not help us to do so .
",
3521,0,," it is generally agreed that we want more renewable power generation in europe even if there are disagreements about where plants should be situated or how much must come from renewable sources .
",
3522,0,," the european union aims to have% of energy from renewable sources by.
",
3523,0,," and if it is to meet co2 reduction targets far more will be needed in following decades .
",
3524,0,," nuclear is also not as helpful as renewables in meeting these co2 reduction targets .
",
3525,0,," it is estimated that renewables produce 10-40g of co2 pre kwh of electricity produced , but nuclear is currently much higher at 90-140g / kwh , though still only a tenth of coal .
",
3526,0,," and as mining becomes more difficult it is estimated that this could double making nuclear no better for reducing co2 than gas power .
",
3527,0,," in the response to fukushima accident european commission carried out a series of stress tests on nuclear power plants in the eu to minimise the risk of such an accident occurring in the eu .
",
3528,0,," the results were disturbing .
",
3529,0,," according to the report european power plants are not well prepared for an emergency situation .
",
3530,0,," some of the power plants would have less than hour to restore safety systems in case of electric blackout .
",
3531,0,," currently more than 100,000 citizens live in proximity ,km , ofreactors .
",
3532,0,," should anything go wrong , many lives would be endangered .
",
3533,0,," the problems could be resolved by dramatic investments into the safety measures .
",
3534,0,," however , these investments would require approximately $bn .
",
3535,0,," this is a sum indebted european union can not afford .
",
3536,0,," therefore shutdown and substitution of these hazardous plants would be a much better idea .
",
3537,1,,"nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions.
",
3538,1,," the most common method is through nuclear fission, though other methods include nuclear fusion and radioactive decay.
",
3539,1,," nuclear fission is the splitting of large atoms into smaller atoms with the release of energy stored in the original nucleus.
",
3540,1,," it produces no greenhouse gases or other such pollutants but does produce radioactive waste that must be stored safely for thousands of years.
",
3541,1,," there is also the risk of a nuclear explosion (due to meltdown) if the reaction gets out of control.
",
3542,1,," this is different from nuclear fusion, a process by which small atoms are joined to create larger atoms, releasing energy in the process.
",
3543,1,," this technology is currently some years away from being widespread.
",
3544,1,,"the debate surrounding the use of nuclear power is hugely contentious.
",
3545,1,," there is much public fear about nuclear energy, fuelled by incidents such as chernobyl, three mile island and, most recently, fukushima in japan.
",
3546,1,," it is, however, an issue which is becoming more important as we approach a time when fossil fuel resources may run out, making it necessary to find other power sources.
",
3547,1,," germany has fuelled the debate by announcing a complete abandonment of its nuclear power programme by 2022, a u-turn on its previous decision to extend the life of its oldest plants by aroundyears.
",
3548,1,," in 2007, nuclear power produced 28% of the eu's commercial electricity, down from 32% in 2002.
",
3549,1,," the us hadreactors providing 19% of the country's electricity.
",
3550,1,,"the main question is whether nuclear energy should constitute a major component of the 21st century mixed economy of energy plans to combat global warming and to help us meet the growing energy demand?
",
3551,0,," nuclear power is the most practical renewable energy source as all the others face major difficulties either in scaling up to provide enough to be a major component of nations energy mix , do n't provide energy all the time , the ` base load ' , or cause other environmental problems .
",
3552,0,," nuclear is a proven technology with large firms that can build large amounts of nuclear energy generation capacity .
",
3553,0,," the most efficient source of renewable energy has been hydroelectric power , however , this usually creates more problems than it solves .
",
3554,0,," building a large dam necessarily floods an enormous region behind the dam which in turn can displace thousands of people .
",
3555,0,," there are also enormous ecological costs to dam building .
",
3556,0,," a classical example is the aswan dam in egypt along the nile .
",
3557,0,," not only did many thousands lose their homes but the yearly inundation of the nile , which fertilised the surrounding land for thousands of year , was also stopped ; the subsequent silting up of the river destroyed much wildlife1 .
",
3558,0,," a similar story of ecological destruction and human homelessness surrounded the more recent three gorges dam project in china2 .
",
3559,0,," wind , tidal , and solar power are all affected by issues of reliability .
",
3560,0,," the tendency of wind power , in particular , to be a volatile source of energy , means that other power sources such as fossil fuel power stations have to make up the shortfall when wind levels drop .
",
3561,0,," tidal power technology is still in at an early stage and may take years to become profitable .
",
3562,0,," it also has the potential to cause environmental problems in the marine environment .
",
3563,0,," for a large area of the european union , there is not the potential to exploit solar power as there are not enough hours of sunlight .
",
3564,0,," `` wind and solar power have their place , but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply ca n't replace big baseload plants such as coal , nuclear and hydroelectric .
",
3565,0,," natural gas , a fossil fuel , is too expensive already , and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants .
",
3566,0,," given that hydroelectric resources are built pretty much to capacity , nuclear is , by elimination , the only viable substitute for coal .
",
3567,0,," it 's that simple .
",
3568,0,," ``although eu countries are using energy more efficiently , demand for energy continues to rise , especially in the new eastern european member states .
",
3569,0,," the demand for electricity is expected to rise by 8-9 % bymeaning a much more urgent need for generating capacity .
",
3570,0,," at the same time world energy consumption is projected to expand by% fromtoleading to high oil and gas prices .
",
3571,0,," the production of renewable energy is not growing at a fast enough pace to replace fossil fuels ; wind , wave and solar simply can not provide the quantities of energy required .
",
3572,0,," it is possible -- indeed , desirable - to combine nuclear power with other renewables , but nuclear energy is a crucial part of that mix as the only option capable of producing the quantity of energy required .
",
3573,0,," nuclear power is actually more efficient than any other power source : a gram of uraniumcontains as much energy as four tons of coal .
",
3574,0,," in many senses nuclear energy is the cleanest of renewables .
",
3575,0,," it does not produce emissions such as co2 and greenhouse gases , which are harmful to the population and the environment .
",
3576,0,," roughlymillion metric tons of co2 emissions are avoided each year in the united states by generating electricity from nuclear power rather than some other source ; according to the u.s. department of energy , that is nearly equivalent to the co2 released from all u.s. passenger cars .
",
3577,0,," it is true that it does produce radioactive waste but since this is in solid form it can be dealt with relatively easily and stored away from centres of population .
",
3578,0,," furthermore , as new technology becomes available to allow the more efficient use of nuclear fuel , less nuclear waste will be produced .
",
3579,0,," , a recent example is the development of the fast breeder reactor , which uses fuel much more efficiently , in addition , the use of nuclear power reduces our foreign energy dependency .
",
3580,0,," the european union is a net importer for energy , and as such is reliant on russia and norway , predominantly , for oil and gas supplies .
",
3581,0,," events such as the dispute between russia and the ukraine over gas supplies demonstrated that the eu 's energy can easily be disrupted by political situations outside its control1 .
",
3582,0,," it also means that the eu could be drawn into disputes between russia and neighbouring countries because it has a vested interest in the region .
",
3583,0,," this could set a dangerous precedent , where the eu could be intimidated by russia , because the eu relies so heavily on russian gas .
",
3584,0,," building more nuclear power stations would ensure a more secure supply of energy , thereby avoiding the potential for energy supply to become a politically charged issue on an international scale .
",
3585,1,,"perhaps ironically, one of the effects of climate change has been to open up new areas of the polar caps – previously unreachable –for use by human beings, including for mineral extraction.
",
3586,1,," the political situation in the arctic ocean gives added bite to the situation, with several countries making claims to the arctic ocean and so its sea bed with attendant mineral wealth.
",
3587,1,,"  the relationship between preservation and development is always a difficult one.
",
3588,1,," there are various balances in play – between modern jobs and cultural heritage, between energy needs and environmental protection, between the possible needs of future generations and the all too pressing interests of the current one.
",
3589,1,,"the primary resources available through arctic exploration are oil, gas, minerals, fresh water (1/5 of the world’s water supply) and fish.
",
3590,1,," but there is also interest in opening up new shipping routes through the region which would reduce travel times from east asia to europe and north america’s atlantic seaboard.
",
3591,1,," the region also has enormous biodiversity, especially in terms of genotypes that are unique to the habitat.
",
3592,1,,"the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that the total volume of sea ice has reduced in the lastyears.
",
3593,1,," however, commentators of varying degrees of credibility have put forward a wide range of explanations for the change.
",
3594,1,," it is important not to conflate two different debates when discussing this topic.
",
3595,1,," at one level – the interest of this debate – there is the issue of how to manage the arctic itself.
",
3596,1,," the issue of the wider implications of climate change, including the impact of arctic warming on salinity and temperature in the world’s oceans, whilst interesting, are a separate issue.
",
3597,1,,"although there are various definitions of what constitutes the arctic – many of them including sub-arctic, sparsely populated forest and tundra – for the purposes of this debate it is that area north of the arctic circle (66° 33'n).
",
3598,1,," the total size of this area is 40,000,000 km2 (15,000,000 sq mi) and covers 8% of the earth.
",
3599,1,,"by ‘exploitation’ this motion will be considered to primarily refer to exploration and drilling for mineral resources.
",
3600,1,," a secondary issue is the shipping opportunities and the transportation of these resources, it’s worth noting that increased opportunities for tourism has also caused some concern but the main focus of the global discussion on this issue as related to the exploitation of resources.
",
3601,1,," primarily the focus is on oil and gas rather than the considerably smaller reserves of other resources.
",
3602,1,," the issue of the ownership of fishing rights is also important but will not be touched on here as it has received far less coverage and comment in the current climate.
",
3603,1,,"the various attempts that have been made so far to extend the claims of arctic nations to greater parts of the sea bed and ocean, as well as efforts to rapidly increase drilling within domestic territory, has led many – environmentalists and others – to suggest that a treaty is needed to protect the whole of the arctic.
",
3604,1,," this could be modelled on the antarctic treaty which freezes territorial claims and bans any military activity in the region; this would not affect current territory but would prevent any militarisation of the arctic ocean.
",
3605,1,," it would add to this an equivalent of the convention on the regulation of antarctic mineral resource activities which does not entirely ban extraction but prevents such activity until it is judged that there would be no adverse environmental impact.
",
3606,0,," as we are using the resources of so much of the planet we should think about our legacy to future generations and leave the resources of the arctic to future generations .
",
3607,0,," there are several reasons why we should do so .
",
3608,0,," first of all drilling in the arctic means drilling in some of the harshest conditions on earth ; with many of the projects being set up it means drilling in deep areas of the ocean that were inaccessible only a couple of decades ago .
",
3609,0,," it also means drilling in freezing conditions while being potentially vulnerable to icebergs .
",
3610,0,," disasters like the deepwater horizon in the gulf of mexico have shown that oil companies are not prepared for oil disasters in deep water and repair would be more difficult a long way from civilization .
",
3611,0,," while the technology for this does not yet exist in future it probably will .
",
3612,0,," it makes sense that we should leave such hard to reach resources until it is possible to extract it easily and safely .
",
3613,0,," in the mean time we should be focusing our efforts on easier to reach resources and on developing alternatives .
",
3614,0,," such a policy will be beneficial to future generations both through making a greener economy and by leaving an emergency reserve of fossil fuel that can be used if necessary .
",
3615,0,," mineral extraction is not a clean process and the arctic is acknowledged as a fragile ecosystem .
",
3616,0,," in addition to the pollution that using these fuels will cause elsewhere in the world , the process of extraction itself is fraught with risks .
",
3617,0,," there is some destruction caused simply by the process of building and running rigs with everything running normally , but the nightmare scenario is a major spill .
",
3618,0,," let 's be clear , with the best will in the world , there will be a spill ; difficult and unpredictable conditions , gruelling tests for both the machinery and the engineers that manage it , and a track record that leaves a lot to be desired in far more habitable and accessible environments .
",
3619,0,," there are two difficulties posed in terms of an off-shore , or below-ice in this case , spill .
",
3620,0,," the first problem is that stopping the spill would be vastly more complicated logistically than anything previously attempted , making previous deep-sea containment exercises seem simple by comparison .
",
3621,0,," the exxon valdez disaster showed the large scale damage that oil spills near the poles can have large and long lasting effects on the ecosystem ; hundreds of thousands of seabirds were killed in the spill and it is estimates some habitats will takeyears to recover .
",
3622,0,," any such disaster is made much worse above the arctic circle because of the cold .
",
3623,0,," oil degrades faster in warmer waters because the metabolism of microbes that break the oil down works much more slowly in the cold arctic waters , at the same time the oil spreads out less so provides less surface area .
",
3624,0,," init was reported that more than two decades after the spill there were still 23,000 gallons of relatively un-weathered oil in prince william sound .
",
3625,0,," the second issue , as demonstrated by large scale experimentation in the 1970s is that the oil would interact with the polar ice to affect a far larger area than would normally be the case .
",
3626,0,," at the very least , it seems sensible to have a moratorium on sub-glacial drilling until the technology is available to deal safely and securely with a spill .
",
3627,0,," the opening up of the arctic ocean through climate change also opens up territorial claims as where there are resources at stake states are keen to make a claim so as to exploit them .
",
3628,0,," for example inrussia 's then president medvedev stated `` our first and fundamental task is to turn the arctic into a resource base for russia in the 21st century . ''
",
3629,0,," such competition for resources can lead to conflict as is increasingly being shown in the east and south china seas .
",
3630,0,," the antarctic treaty however freezes these territorial claims , as would our proposed treaty .
",
3631,0,," it also bans military activity so preventing any completion from getting out of hand .
",
3632,0,," the proposal would also ban the exploitation of the arctic 's resources so reducing the cause of any conflict .
",
3633,1,,"heathrow is london’s, and there the united kingdom’s, main airport.
",
3634,1,," it is the world’s fourth busiest airport and handles more international passengers than any other airport.
",
3635,1,," since 1950, a couple of years after heathrow first opened, the number of passengers passing through uk airports has increased a hundred fold.
",
3636,1,," and numbers are forecast to continue increasing, doubling again to reach 480million byso airports are becoming congested.
",
3637,1,," there is then a clear need to expand the existing infrastructure or build anew.
",
3638,1,," unfortunately this is not a simple proposition, expanding existing airports inevitably encounters local opposition due to the added noise it would cause.
",
3639,1,," simply building new airports ad hoc to meet demand is also not possible due to the need for airlines to mostly use hub airports so any new airport would need to be very large and would be a very long term project.
",
3640,1,,"hub airports are where airlines converge their flights on large airports in order to use that airport as a transfer point to enable their passengers to get to their intended destination.
",
3641,1,," a ‘hub’ airport essentially depends on two factors: 1) the ‘spokes’ of the hub, these are feeder airports that, lacking enough demand, do not keep open a large range of routes for efficiency reasons, instead sending passengers to the hubs to board onward flights, and 2) whether the ‘hub’ airport itself has the capacity to receive and manage the demand of its ‘spokes’, which is to say whether the ‘hub’ is big enough or not.
",
3642,1,," having an airport with a large capacity and a strategic situation, it is the case of london with regards to transatlantic exchanges, is the basis for having a ‘hub’.
",
3643,1,,"the argument about expanding heathrow, britain’s main hub airport, and how to meet increasing demand if not expanding heathrow, has been raging for several years with the government unwilling to come to a final decision.
",
3644,1,," in the debate the airlines, british airports association, and business more generally, are pitted against local communities and environmentalists in disagreements over the necessity of more runways and the impact those expansions will have.
",
3645,1,," the other side of the debate is less about whether expansion should occur at all but more over whether it should occur at heathrow or in other locations as gatwick, stansted, or in the thames estuary as proposed by london’s mayor boris johnson.
",
3646,0,," put simply heathrow is at the limits of its capacity so there needs to be expansion .
",
3647,0,," heathrow is already at% capacity and running so close to maximum capacity means that any minor problem can result in large delays for passengers .
",
3648,0,," london 's major rivals have four-runway hub airports paris , frankfurt , even madrid this means these cities have much greater capacity as they can take up to 700,000 flights a year compared to heathrow 's 480,000 .
",
3649,0,," britain does not want to be left behind , crumbling in the dust .
",
3650,0,," these airports therefore clearly have the capacity to take flights that would otherwise be going to heathrow .
",
3651,0,," heathrow needs to expand to maintain its competitiveness so that the airport retains its position the most popular place to stop-over in before catching a connecting flight .
",
3652,0,," colin matthews , the chief executive of heathrow , formerly baa , has argued that heathrow 's lack of hub capacity currently costs the uk # 14billion .
",
3653,0,," heathrow is in danger of falling behind continental rivals in frankfurt and amsterdam .
",
3654,0,," expanding heathrow would ensure many current jobs as well as creating new ones .
",
3655,0,," currently , heathrow supports around 250,000 jobs .
",
3656,0,," added to this many hundreds of thousands more are dependent upon the tourist trade in london which relies on good transport links like heathrow .
",
3657,0,," loosing competitiveness in front of other european airports not only could imply wasting the possibility to create new jobs , but lose some of those that already exist .
",
3658,0,," expansion of heathrow would also be building a vital part of infrastructure at a time when british infrastructure spending is very low as a result of the recession so helping to boost growth .
",
3659,0,," good flight connections are critical for attracting new business and maintaining current business .
",
3660,0,," this is because aviation infrastructure is important for identifying new business opportunities .
",
3661,0,," the uk 's economic future depends on trading not just with traditional destinations in europe and america but also with the expanding cities of china and india , cities such as chongqing and chengdu .
",
3662,0,," businesses based in these cities will be much more likely to invest in britain with direct flights .
",
3663,0,," flying is critical for business .
",
3664,0,," heathrow is well located for the people that will pick up the bill funding its expansion .
",
3665,0,," people need to be able to get to their homes and work easily from the airport otherwise it is impractical .
",
3666,0,," according to the civil aviation authority% of business passengers start their journey withinminutes of heathrow , far more than any other airport .
",
3667,0,," this demonstrates that the demand for heathrow 's services from the local area is real and pronounced .
",
3668,0,," heathrow is closer to london than its rivals gatwick and stansted and has better transport links through the piccadilly line and heathrow express .
",
3669,0,," a new airport could potentially be closer , but finding space within the m25 for a large airport without attracting the same kind of opposition that expanding heathrow has would be next to impossible
",
3670,1,,"dams have probably existed for about as long as humans have had agriculture, to control water flow and to use the hydraulic energy for a water mill.
",
3671,1,," since the 19th century, dams have also been used to convert the hydraulic energy into electricity.
",
3672,1,," there are several methods, but they all rely on the dam (in jargon called a hydroelectric power station) converting the energy of flowing water into electricity through a turbine and generator.
",
3673,1,,"there are all sizes of hydroelectric power stations, varying from ‘pico hydro’, which is usually just a few pipes diverting water from a river instead of a dam, to large and specialized industrial facilities.
",
3674,1,," the large dams generate a lot of energy but have also drawn a lot of criticism because they involve large-scale landscape restructuring.
",
3675,1,," this casefile takes a closer look into that debate, and ignores issues that might come into play around the smaller scale hydroelectric power stations.
",
3676,1,,"the largest hydroelectric power stations in operation as ofare the three gorges dam in china, itaipu, shared by brazil and paraguay, huri in venezuela, tcuruí in brazil and the grand coulee in the united states.
",
3677,1,," power from hydroelectric power stations inwas about 15% of total power production and is by far the largest renewable energy source in use, providing between 80% - 85% of total renewable energy production.
",
3678,0,," hydroelectric dams burn no fossil fuels so emit no greenhouse gasses at all in producing energy .
",
3679,0,," suppose we replace all coal fired power stations with hydroelectric power stations .
",
3680,0,," in, over% of global electricity production was produced through coal , accounting for over% of global carbon dioxide emissions .
",
3681,0,," since there is more than enough potential capacity for hydropower , we could hypothetically completely replace coal and even other fossil fuels for electricity , thus helping cut down greenhouse gas emissions massively .
",
3682,0,," in, about 1.4 billion people had no access to electricity .
",
3683,0,," hydropower provides a source of energy that is cheaper even than conventional coal .
",
3684,0,," large dams can last for over a hundred years and are easy to switch on and off according to demand , making them very cost-effective .
",
3685,0,," given that having no access to electricity makes work and study nearly impossible , alleviating global poverty by giving access to electricity is an important step to take .
",
3686,0,," the large water reservoirs created by hydroelectric dams can provide facilities for water sports and can become tourist attractions themselves .
",
3687,0,," the reservoirs can be used for irrigation to help farmers and can be a means for flood control .
",
3688,0,," a prime example of this is the tennessee valley authority , an organisation responsible for flood control , electricity generation , economic development and even fertilizer generation in the tennessee valley in the u.s. , spanning parts of alabama , mississippi , kentucky , georgia , north carolina and virginia .
",
3689,1,,"in 1930, there were between five and ten million wild african elephants; by 1990, when they were added to the list of critically endangered species, only about 600,000 remained1.
",
3690,1,," as part of the effort to combat this threat, in 1986, ivory trading was banned by the united nations convention on international trade in endangered species (cites).
",
3691,1,," by the mid-1990s, the population of african elephants was rising by an average of 4.5% a year, however bythe trend had again been reversed and the population stood at around 500,000.
",
3692,1,," asian elephants have fared just as badly, there numbers have dropped from 200,000 a century ago to around 40,000 today1.
",
3693,1,,"during the '90s, when elephant populations were increasing, cites allowed botswana, zimbabwe and namibia to sell ivory stockpiled by their governments' environmental agencies to japan, the centre of international demand for ivory, as a one-off measure.
",
3694,1,," insouth africa and other southern african states argued unsuccessfully at the cites convention in nairobi for the ban on ivory sales to be more generally relaxed.
",
3695,0,," in 2008, cite temporarily lifted the ban on the sale of existing stockpiles of ivory, generating much-needed income for african states2.
",
3696,0,,"poaching has been effectively eliminated in parts of southern africa through efficient game park management and the development of game tourism , which gives local peoples an incentive to protect wildlife as a long-term economic resource .
",
3697,0,," in kenya , tourism is the third largest contributor to their economy , and% of this is derived from wildlife , but it is still not enough1 .
",
3698,0,," the director of the association in kenya charged with elephant protection , the lusaka agreement taskforce , has admitted mobilizing adequate resources to combat the illegal wildlife trade is a challenge2 .
",
3699,0,," for this approach to be sustained the parks must generate greater income ; realistically , this can only be done through the sale of stockpiled ivory .
",
3700,0,," why should they not be able to profit from stockpiled ivory confiscated from poachers or dead elephants ?
",
3701,0,," ivory is expensive to store , and degrades over time .
",
3702,0,," it costs zimbabwe $million annually to secure its stockpile1 .
",
3703,0,," the wildlife authority in the country is now keen for the moratorium on the international sale of ivory to end inso that they can benefit from the stockpiling and recoup the costs of storage1 .
",
3704,0,," zimbabwe is also believed to be close to the limit of its storage space1 .
",
3705,0,," it is therefore sensible to allow its sale in order to recoup these expenses and to do so on a permanent , controlled basis , rather than through one-off schemes such as thesale to japan .
",
3706,0,," the elephant populations of southern african states are growing rapidly , placing a strain upon the resources of the national parks in which they live .
",
3707,0,," this has necessitated culls with the result that government environment agencies have built up large stockpiles of ivory , also acquired from animals that died naturally , which they are currently unable to sell .
",
3708,0,," relaxing the cites ban on trading ivory , subject to careful regulation , would bring much needed cash to the environmental programmes of these impoverished countries , helping them to safeguard the long-term survival of african elephants .
",
3709,0,," the relaxation of the cites ban in the late '90s was worth $million for bostwana , namibia and zimbabwe ; as regular income , such a figure would be invaluable for a struggling central african economy .
",
3710,0,," states that possess elephant populations that are currently growing would be eligible , under the new model , to sell their stockpiled ivory .
",
3711,0,," there would be no limit on the amount of ivory sold , provided that the growth rate of the population remained positive .
",
3712,0,," therefore , the confiscated ivory from poachers and small-scale culls would be eligible to be sold on the international market .
",
3713,0,," all sales would have to go through the environmental agencies of the states ' concerned .
",
3714,0,," a trading ban does not choke off demand for the ivory , but instead raises the price to exorbitant levels , encouraging poaching .
",
3715,0,," demand sincehas been depressed by japan 's economic problems , from which it is now emerging , while in china ivory is associated with prosperity and is a status symbol ; as the number of wealthy chinese increases , so too is the demand and price of ivory .
",
3716,0,," poachers are only going to be further encouraged to disregard the trading ban , whatever the costs1 .
",
3717,0,," legitimate , regulated sales would undercut the illegal market and drive the poachers out of business , ensuring elephant populations are protected and remain stable .
",
3718,1,,"the precautionary principle has no universally accepted definition, therio declaration on environment and development defined it as 'where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.'
",
3719,1,,"  shale gas is a term used to describe natural gas trapped as hydrocarbons within saturated rock formations, especially the sedimentary rock shale.
",
3720,1,," although quite widespread, until the past decade or so shale gas has not been much exploited as an energy source as it cannot be extracted easily and cheaply by traditional drilling techniques.
",
3721,1,," in recent years this has changed as higher energy prices have made investment in shale gas fields more worthwhile, and improved extraction techniques have meant that unconventional sources of energy can now be exploited more easily.
",
3722,1,," the main process involved in extracting shale gas is hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”), where a fluid is forced down a well to create a build-up of pressure in the rock below, forcing it to break up and allowing the gas contained within it to be recovered to the surface.
",
3723,1,,"shale gas formations can be found across much of the eastern and central parts of north america.
",
3724,1,," exploitation first took off in 2000; the number of wells in the barnett shales of texas grew from less thanto overin the eight years to 2008.
",
3725,1,," other deposits being exploited include the marcellus shales of new york and adjacent states, and the haynesville shales in louisiana and texas.
",
3726,1,," there is now interest in exploiting similar deposits across the border in quebec, as well as in poland and the uk within europe.
",
3727,1,,"proponents of shale gas argue that it can provide a vast new source of reliable and economical energy, as well as helping industrial economies move towards a lower-carbon future.
",
3728,1,," but sceptics doubt the economic viability of the sector, question its environmental impact, and raise serious safety concerns.
",
3729,1,," these voices are becoming increasingly influential in the usa, and are attempting to block the exploitation of shale gas in canada and europe.
",
3730,0,," the residents of areas where shale gas is found and drilling may occur have a right to maintain their health , something which drilling may affect .
",
3731,0,," dangerous chemicals are pumped into rock formations that are also the source of groundwater for millions of people .
",
3732,0,," ina hydrologist found benzene in a water well in wyoming above where fracking was occurring .
",
3733,0,," dramatic film of inflammable gas leaking through drinking water pipes underlines the risks posed by this uncontrolled experiment under our homes .
",
3734,0,," companies are in denial over these dangers , but their refusal to come clean about exactly what chemicals they are using is hardly reassuring .
",
3735,0,," while there is a chance that lives are at risk , either from water contamination or from gas explosions as a result of the fracking such risky methods of extracting natural gas should be banned .
",
3736,0,," given that some of the negative consequences from hydraulic fracturing processes may take many years to emerge , the precautionary principle should be applied .
",
3737,0,," applying the precautionary principle would mean changing the burden of proof from environmentalists having to prove that fracking does cause harm in each circumstance to it being the oil and gas firms who have to prove that fracking is safe .
",
3738,0,," as a result fracking should be stopped all together or at the very least greatly reducing the amount of fracking leaving only a few fields in operation so that the effects of the process can be studied and as a result sufficient legislation but in place to regulate the industry .
",
3739,0,," until it can be prove these methods are entirely safe , hydraulic fracturing should be stopped and the shale gas industry denied further drilling permits .
",
3740,0,," expanding shale gas extraction would be very damaging to the environment as the process requires a large number of small wells to be drilled in each gas field , ohio for example has 80,000 fracked wells , by comparison only 10,000 have been drilled in the uk part of the north sea since.
",
3741,0,," this means beautiful rural areas will be spoiled by the presence of many gas rigs , each with its accompanying pipes , buildings , tracks , etc, agricultural and amenity land will be lost and wildlife disturbed .
",
3742,0,," and heavy construction traffic will ruin roads and create noise pollution for nearby residents .
",
3743,0,," climate change is the biggest problem facing our planet and it requires urgent action for us to shift to a low-carbon economy .
",
3744,0,," shale gas is simply another fossil fuel , releasing carbon into the atmosphere when it is burnt to provide power .
",
3745,0,," as the tyndall centre warns `` while it is possible that shale gas could substitute for coal , within the uk , this would likely be counteracted by global use of coal and shale gas . ''
",
3746,0,," so rather than replacing even dirtier coal as a source of power , it is likely simply to augment it , feeding our wasteful society 's insatiable appetite for energy .
",
3747,0,," indeed , if shale gas lowers the price of fossil fuels , it may contribute further to the problem by encouraging a continued rise in energy consumption .
",
3748,0,," worse , by taking investment from renewable energy sources such as solar , tidal and wind energy , shale gas may postpone the necessary shift to a low-carbon economy .
",
3749,1,,"climate change and global warming are the result of massive emissions of ‘greenhouse gases’ such as co2, cfcs and nitrous oxide.
",
3750,1,," this has been a problem due to the exponential increase in the burning of fossil fuels throughout the industrial revolution which began in the 19th century.
",
3751,1,," climate change is a phenomenon which will have a global impact, although of course nations will be affected to different degrees.
",
3752,1,," although the problem is a global one, developed nations who are heavily industrialised usually release more greenhouse gases per capita than developing ones.
",
3753,1,," in attempting to address and solve global warming, many have asked whether developed nations - which led the industrial revolution and are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere - should bear a greater responsibility for combating climate change.
",
3754,1,,"this has been stimulated in large part by the kyoto protocol signed in 1992, which exempted developing nations such as china and india, from the same emissions-reductions obligations as developed countries.
",
3755,1,," the principle underlying kyoto is known as ""common but differentiated responsibilities"", which continues as a centerpiece principle for those calling on developed countries to assume a greater responsibility.
",
3756,1,," china, india, and other developing countries call for recognition of this principle, while many developed countries argue that conditions have changed as developing countries have begun to industrialize and pollute more rapidly in recent years.
",
3757,1,," there are many questions involved in this public debate.
",
3758,1,," the question of who should bear the burden of cutting emissions in order to prevent climate change has been a central reason for there being no new major binding agreement along similar lines to the original kyoto treaty.
",
3759,1,," the united nations climate change conferences at copenhagen and cancun did not live up to their billing and did not result in a renewal of kyoto or the creation of a replacement with agreements being in more minor areas such as creating a ‘green climate fund’ at cancun.
",
3760,1,," the most recent united nations climate change conference in durban was slightly more successful with agreement that kyoto would continue until a new agreement is finalized although not all original parties to the agreement are willing to sign up, canada for example has left the treaty.
",
3761,1,," more importantly there was agreement on the ‘durban platform’ from developing countries like china and india that they will be a part of a legally binding treaty to be negotiated by 2015.
",
3762,1,," this therefore opens the door to developing countries taking more responsibility to combat climate change.
",
3763,0,," it is the developed world that has the capability to combat climate change .
",
3764,0,," it is they that have most to cut per capita .
",
3765,0,," more importantly it is these developed countries that have the research capabilities to come up with the necessary technology to make the economy greener , to produce renewable energy , to mitigate against the effects of disasters .
",
3766,0,," moreover these same places are the countries that have the finance available to fund these activities ; not only funding the research into the solutions but also the financial resources to put them into action all around the world .
",
3767,0,," poor countries turn to the powerful financial centres such as london and new york to finance large projects , the same will be the case with projects to mitigate climate change .
",
3768,0,," finally these countries have the expertise to put these new inventions and projects into practice ; they have the experts to work out the best places to build , to advise on building , and make sure the project does not have unintended side effects .
",
3769,0,," as the nations with the greatest capability , developed nations have an increased responsibility to act .
",
3770,0,," the most developed nations are also the most powerful in the international community ; they have a duty to lead by example .
",
3771,0,," even if india and china are rapidly rising the developed countries between them are still the most powerful economies .
",
3772,0,," if developing nations perceive that more developed ones are not acting to combat climate change , they will have no imperative to act .
",
3773,0,," this is because some developing countries such as china or india want to maximize their development capacity in order to compete with developed countries .
",
3774,0,," they are only likely to cut carbon emissions if those developed nations they compete with do so first -- that way their attempt to compete is not jeopardised .
",
3775,0,," the climate change talks that have achieved relatively little have shown this to be the case -- china has only shown willing to do a deal if the united states commits itself first .
",
3776,0,," it is through heavy industrialisation that developed countries are developed -- since they contributed more to climate change , they have a greater obligation to resolve it .
",
3777,0,," climate change has largely been caused by long-term emissions by developed countries .
",
3778,0,," while china is now the world 's biggest co2 emitter and other developing countries emissions are rapidly rising historically the vast majority of emissions have been from developed nations .
",
3779,0,," fromtothe united states produced 314,772 million metric tonnes of co2 compared to china 's 89,243 million metric tonnes and while india now produces more co2 germany over the same period emitted three times as much .
",
3780,0,," as co2 can remain in the atmosphere for a long time , about% will be removed withinyears , but% or more may remain for thousands of years , the history of emissions is as relevant as current emissions .
",
3781,0,," since they contribute more of the damage , and since each nation has a responsibility for the harm it has caused , developed nations have an increased obligation to combat climate change .
",
3782,0,," developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita , inthe us emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to china 's 5.3 tons per person , and therefore a reduction from these nations is both easier and has a greater impact than from developing nations .
",
3783,0,," countries with high co2 emissions can reduce these emissions through lifestyle changes that do not reduce citizens quality of life , for example simply by reducing the amount they drive -- walking or going by bike when only going a short distance -- whereas for developing nations reductions either have to work out ways of doing things more efficiently or accept that living standards will be affected as most people 's lifestyles are already low carbon , the challenge is to keep it that way while improving quality of life .
",
3784,0,," developing nations need to be allowed to develop without the burden of emission restrictions .
",
3785,0,," developed nations have been allowed to industrialize at whatever pace they wished , and through industrialization produce emissions .
",
3786,0,," despite having been polluting the atmosphere as a result of industrialization since the early 19th century developed nations only began comprehensively limiting pollution after world war ii in order to reduce smog through regulation such as theair pollution control act andclean air act in the united states and many developed countries have yet to regulate their co2 emissions .
",
3787,0,," having had free reign to develop foryears the developed nations need to take responsibility for thoseyears of irresponsibility while giving the developing world longer to clean up its act .
",
3788,0,," the developing world at the same time has higher responsibilities that come first , for example to ensure that there is no one living in poverty .
",
3789,0,," in indiamillion people live on under $ 1.25 per day , it is absurd to suggest that india despite having higher co2 emissions than japan , indeed almost double , should have to reduce its emissions by a similar amount and at the same time industrialise to pull these millions out of poverty .
",
3790,1,,"global climate change, formally referred to as global warming, is the largest threat facing the long term survival of the human species.
",
3791,1,," the leading authority on climate change is the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), a scientific intergovernmental body tasked with reviewing and assessing the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change.
",
3792,1,," although debates in the media still rage over the causes of climate change, today the majority of climate scientists believe that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (ghgs), of which carbon dioxide (co2) is the best known, are building up in the atmosphere causing global temperatures to slowly rise.
",
3793,1,," the continued rise of atmospheric ghgs (measured in parts per million [ppm] of co2 equivalent) may have catastrophic consequences for earth and its inhabitants.
",
3794,0,," while some people hold out hope that new government policy, new technology, and/or greater individual action will reverse the pattern of rising annual ghg emissions, others are less optimistic and believe that by the time humanity recognizes the true costs of climate change, it will be too late mitigate the consequences.
",
3795,0,,"the ipcc 's fourth assessment report determined that atmospheric ghg emissions needed to stabilize at 450ppm in order to avoid a temperature rise of more than 2-2 .4 c. atmospheric ppm are currently atand are rising at a rate of aboutppm per year .
",
3796,0,," in order to stabilize atppm , the developed world would need to reduce its emissions by 25-40 % byand 80-90 % byalong with significant reductions in the emissions growth rate of developing countries.
",
3797,0,," only a handful of countries , all of them in europe , have achieved any reduction in annual ghg emissions despite promises to do so going back to thekyoto protocol .2 as a result , there is no evidence on which to reasonably conclude that atmospheric ghgs will be stabilized at 450ppm .

",
3803,0,," developing countries such as china and india are growing rapidly and causing massive increases in global ghg emissions through fossil fuel use and deforestation .
",
3804,0,," it took developed countries 100s of years to create a standard of living high enough for an environmental movement to develop .
",
3805,0,," it is more likely than not that developing countries will continue to increase their annual emissions for decades , greatly eclipsing any potential reductions in the developed world .
",
3806,0,," according to joseph romm , former us assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy , `` china 's growth in emissions could erode all other countries ' efforts to stabilize the world 's temperature ''.
",
3807,0,," as a result , atmospheric ghgs will continue to increase , causing greater climate change .
",
3808,0,," the kyoto protocol failed to reduce global ghg emissions and in the midst of an economic crisis , world leaders were unable to even agree to a replacement treaty when it expired .
",
3809,0,," there is no meaningful global emissions reduction treaty ready for ratification and no reason to be optimistic that one is forthcoming .
",
3810,0,," the developing world believes it has a legitimate right to expand economically without emissions caps because the rich world is responsible for the vast majority of emissions over the lastyears and per capita emissions in developing countries are still far lower than in the developed world .
",
3811,0,," as such , developing countries will only agree to a global accord that pays for their emissions reductions/abatement .
",
3812,0,," however , the developed world is unwilling to transfer wealth in exchange for a right to emit , particularly at a time when so many have large budget deficits.
",
3813,0,," given that the growth of annual emissions is being driven by developing countries , many developed countries , like the us , believe that any treaty that does not include developing countries , particularly china , would be fruitless .
",
3814,0,," increased ghgs in the atmosphere have numerous significant consequences : - glaciers , ice sheets , and perma frost will continue to melt .
",
3815,0,," this will increase water levels , release more ghgs , methane , which is twenty times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than co2 and co2 , and reflect less heat back into the atmosphere exacerbating climate change1 .
",
3816,0,," - the oceans , which are a natural carbon sink , are becoming increasingly acidic which will significantly damage ecosystems such as coral reefs .
",
3817,0,," additionally , changes in the chemistry of the ocean could affect the amount of co2 it can absorb and process annually .
",
3818,0,," - there will be increasing incidents of extreme weather such as hurricanes , floods , and record high/low temperatures .
",
3819,0,," extreme weather can destroy ecosystems that capture co2 such as forests and peat bogs leading to less natural co2 absorption .
",
3820,0,," these events will accelerate climate change making it more difficult for humans to reduce ghg ppms to a sustainable level .
",
3821,0,," once average temperatures are above 2.5 c , events will be triggered that will be irreversible and it will take 1000s of years of lower ghg emissions for the earth to return to normal.
",
3822,1,,"blasphemy is the act of showing contempt or speaking offensively about a deity or of persons and symbols regarded as sacred by the followers of a specific religion.
",
3823,1,," the concept of blasphemy is mostly associated with the abrahamic religions (christianity, judaism and islam) and many nation states which affiliate with one of these have, at one time or another, created laws against committing blasphemous acts directed at their dominant religious tradition.
",
3824,1,,"as the world in general becomes more liberal and secular however the need for such laws has come into question.
",
3825,1,," in a number of european states, blasphemy laws still exist in common law and statute, but are left dormant and unused.
",
3826,1,," censorship and classification bodies in western liberal democracies may be permitted to take account of statements or images that may be blasphemous when deciding whether films or broadcast media should be cut or certified.
",
3827,1,,"contrary to assertions that the idea of blasphemy no longer has a significant influence on free speech within western liberal democracies, inan attempt was made by a christian campaigning group to sue the producers of the music jerry springer: the opera for blasphemous libel.
",
3828,1,," jerry springer featured an appearance by a character strongly resembling jesus, who admitted to being “a little bit gay”.
",
3829,1,," onmarchit was announced that the film visions of ecstasy would be released on dvd in the uk, after the film was banned from cinemas by the british board of film classification in 1989.
",
3830,1,," visions, based on the life of the christian mystic st teresa if alvila, portrayed female actresses and an actor representing a crucified christ in a number of highly sexualized scenes.
",
3831,1,," following initial attempts to release the film, the conservative mp graham bright openly called for its negative print to be destroyed.
",
3832,1,,"although laws allowing prosecution of the producers of blasphemous material were repealed in the united kingdom in 2008, blasphemy laws are still strongly enforced in many muslim states.
",
3833,1,," the parliament of the small gulf state of kuwait voted in aprilto allow the death sentenced to be imposed on anyone successfully prosecuted of blasphemy in a kuwaiti court.
",
3834,1,," hamad al-naqi, a kuwaiti citizen was arrested earlier in the year for allegedly publishing blasphemous comments on the social networking site twitter.

",
3836,1,,"onmay a tunisian court is due to hand down a verdict in a blasphemy prosecution mounted against one of the arab states private television broadcaster, nessma tv.
",
3837,1,," the case followed the broadcast of the film persepolis, which recounts a young iranian girl’s perspective on the country’s islamist revolution of 1979.
",
3838,1,," politically engaged salafist tunisians perceived the broadcast of the film as an attack against islam and tunisian’s moderate ennahda political movement.
",
3839,1,," secular middle and upper class tunisians, many of whom were connected to the authoritarian regime of the country’s ousted dictator zine al-abidine ben ali, have portrayed support for the prosecution as an attack on free speech  and tunisian’s broadly liberal academic traditions.
",
3840,1,,"“ the philosopher j b bury referred to laws that instituted religious toleration as an “imperfect” form of liberty.
",
3841,1,," bury thought that imperfect or limited religious liberty was preferable in plural societies, as it limited possible conflicts between groups with competing religious claims.
",
3842,1,," religious tolerance is closely interlinked with blasphemy, as historical, moral, ethical, legal or cosmological claims made by one religion can often be seen as a direct attack on similar claims made by other religions.
",
3843,1,,"as noted above, many religions call for the persecution or, at the very least, condemnation of anyone who chooses to make a blasphemous statement.
",
3844,1,," allowing members of these religions to exercise a full range of religious liberty would entail allowing them to act against statements that they identified as blasphemous.
",
3845,1,," in a multi-cultural society that permits freedom of conscience, such a policy would inevitably lead to conflict.anti-blasphemy laws often manifest themselves in states that contain a majority population of individuals who actively practice a particular religion.
",
3846,1,," official recognition of blasphemy laws is often described as being derived from a popular mandate – states such as pakistan and saudi arabia claim that their citizens want to see blasphemy laws based on religious proscriptions enforced, and that their executive and judicial authorities are doing nothing more than carrying out citizens’ demands.
",
3847,1,," indeed, some forms of blasphemy law may do nothing more than recognize and regularize norms that already exist in certain societies.
",
3848,1,," but this position becomes problematic when these values and ideals are used to persecute groups who lie outside of the majority religion that enforces them.
",
3849,1,,"in novemberasia bibi, a christian pakistani, was sentenced to death for blaspheming against islam.
",
3850,1,," the accusation of blasphemy followed an incident during which ms bibi was attacked by a mob, following accusations that she had “dirtied” drinking water used by muslim women in her village.
",
3851,1,," a prominent pakistani cleric later announced an $8000 reward for her death.
",
3852,1,,"this, and similar cases, provide some of the most extreme examples of the chilling effect that laws which restrict speech can have on the development of a society.
",
3853,1,," although states may aim to give official recognition to blasphemy laws that may already exist in communities under their control as a means of regulating and tempering their use, official recognition often serves to do nothing more than strengthen zealots’ causes and justify acts of violence directed at non-conformists.
",
3854,1,," many religious scholars, such as al shaffi in the islamic tradition, and the christian theologian erasmus have openly espoused toleration for dissenters within a faith and for those “outside” a particular religion who profess alternative religious ideas.
",
3855,1,," both recognized that social stability and the progress and development of centralized and increasingly cosmopolitan societies could only be achieved by implementing religious tolerance of a form similar to the “recognition respect” described in timothy garton ash’s article on freedom of religious expression.
",
3856,1,,"often, recognition of this kind of freedom of expression can be influenced by external factors that affect the structure of particular societies.
",
3857,1,," as both garton ash and bury point out, freedom of religious expression and belief has been a frequent subject of debate throughout india’s history.
",
3858,1,," india- to this day- comprises a wide range of communities, ethnicities and religious traditions.
",
3859,1,," the durability of any monarch or ruling power within the sub-continent has always been contingent on official support for limitations on religions’ ability to react to perceived blasphemies or slights.
",
3860,1,,"historical experience has proven the efficacy of such policies.
",
3861,1,," with the world becoming increasingly plural, mobile and multi-cultural, now is the time to revisit and refresh these principles, and to position them prominently in public discourse.
",
3862,0,," - alexander cavellblasphemy can not be shielded by the rationale which is used to defend freedom of speech .
",
3863,0,," blasphemy constitutes an attack on the religion it is targeted at .
",
3864,0,," beyond its ability to shock and offend , blasphemy exposes religious believers to ridicule , and perpetuates lies and falsehoods about their faith .
",
3865,0,," moreover , blasphemy also drives conflict and exclusion within particular faiths , deepening schismatic divisions and encouraging believers to become more hostile to those who do not share their religion .
",
3866,0,," blasphemy occupies a distinctly different position in public debate and discussion than civil , respectful discourse about religion .
",
3867,0,," the forms of blasphemy law that were maintained in the legal systems of western liberal democracies throughout the twentieth century criminalised only the most extreme and intentionally provocative forms of religious expression -- images of religious figures involved in humiliating or sexualised scenarios ; statements about a religion that amounted to hate speech ; and words that were intended to mislead and deceive the naïve , credulous or doubting .
",
3868,0,," the english blasphemy case of r v boulter drew on the conclusions of the sixth report of the commissioners on criminal law , which had observed that a criminal charge could only arise when `` irreligion '' took the form of an `` insult to god and man '' .
",
3869,0,," the judge in the case remarked that `` if the decencies of controversy are observed , even the fundamentals of religion may be attacked with tout the writer being guilty of blasphemy . ''
",
3870,0,," ruling in the case of whitehouse v lemon , heard in, a senior english judge remarked that blasphemous libel , although thought to have fallen into disuse and irrelevance remained useful in safeguarding `` the internal tranquillity of the kingdom . ''
",
3871,0,," this principle appears to be an antecedent to the public order justification for hate speech legislation -- speech that spurs people to commit violent or disruptive acts should be curtailed to protect public safety .
",
3872,0,," that case restated the idea that `` it is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the christian religion , or to deny the existence of god , if the publication is couched in decent in temperate language . ''
",
3873,0,," this is the sense in which the proposition side will discuss the term `` blasphemous '' .
",
3874,0,," the proposition side does not intend to limit free speech , but has every intention of ensuring that free speech is not undermined or delegitimised by allowing the unobstructed broadcasting of hateful and provocative statements .
",
3875,0,," we protect freedom of speech in our society not as a good in and of itself , but because through debate of even the most improbable propositions , socially valuable ideas may emerge and concerns that might otherwise be hidden can be expressed .
",
3876,0,," by contrast , language aimed solely at offense has no redeeming value and does not contribute to any wider exchange of ideas and concerns .
",
3877,0,," blasphemy does not appeal to reason , and by being directly exclusionary and offensive , it limits that ability of believers and non-believers to engage in structured debate .
",
3878,0,," laws combating discrimination - such as the blasphemy law that the proposition side are advocating - promote social cohesion and stability , both important policy objectives in increasingly mobile and cosmopolitan societies .

",
3882,0,," too often the uncertainty that accompanies migrant life can serve to inspire to give too much credence to the views of zealots and fundamentalists .
",
3883,0,," to prevent communities deliberately isolating themselves from their neighbours ; to prevent communal violence , it is necessary for the state to create an environment in which disputes can be resolved by impartial and properly trained prosecutorial authorities .
",
3884,0,," discrimination laws are instrumental to building peaceful social realities .
",
3885,0,," they signify a welcoming society , in which it is unacceptable to offend entire segments of the population by debasing what they hold most precious .
",
3886,0,," blasphemous statements have a power that reaches far beyond `` ordinary '' hate speech .
",
3887,0,," acts covered by this law would include intentionally provocative publications such as the cartoons of the prophet mohammed that featured prominently in a danish newspaper in.
",
3888,0,," these images led to widespread protests and violence in both western states and majority muslim countries .
",
3889,0,," the offensive content of the cartoons gave credence and legitimacy to sects and clerics espousing absolutist ideas that have no space for compromise or understanding .
",
3890,0,," further , the protests also brought individuals who would ordinarily have considered themselves moderates into contact with violent extremists .
",
3891,0,," neither of these outcomes does anything to promote a culture of free and frank discussion within the societies affected .
",
3892,0,," the legal measures that side proposition supports do not oblige free thinkers to remain silent in the face of zealotry and bigotry .
",
3893,0,," however , they does require writers , journalists and artists to apply their reason and their sense to content that they want to publish for mass consumption .
",
3894,0,," much like laws that prevent the negligent operation of businesses , anti-blasphemy laws would set a minimal standard of responsible conduct in order to ensure that publications did not cause a dangerous level of offense to significant numbers ordinary and rational religious believers .
",
3895,0,," legal definitions and enforcement of standards of responsibility do not preclude individuals from pursuing dangerous or entrepreneurial business ventures or public works .
",
3896,0,," they need not prevent the creation of controversial and challenging forms of free expression either .

",

",
3902,1,,"during the last two decades, the musical genre known as hip hop has found itself at the forefront of this debate.
",
3903,1,," throughout the 1980s a trend towards realist lyrics that reflected the poverty and dispossession of the black communities from which hip hop emerged led to the creation of the “gangsta” rap genre, which fixated on gang violence and drug consumption.
",
3904,1,," feuds between commercially successful rappers during the 1990s culminated in shootings and deaths.
",
3905,1,," links between hip hop music and violence in inner city areas remain largely unexamined.
",

3909,1,," the form requires organisers to state the type of music being performed at their event.
",
3910,1,," up untilthe form asked organisers to give “demographic” details of an event’s likely audience, including their age and race.
",
3911,1,," “proposals of this type often tend to focus on one particular musical genre.
",
3912,1,," in the case of the example above, the genre targeted for increased regulation is hip hop.
",
3913,1,," many critics, from both inside and outside the hip hop industry have noted its increased focus on themes of gang violence, misogyny and aggressive materialism.
",
3914,1,,"those at the most extreme end of the critical spectrum claim that feuds between hip hop artists demonstrate that it is an art form that trades exclusively in images of cynical brutality, and that by equating thuggish behaviour with a glamorous lifestyle, it encourages other individuals to act in a similar way.
",
3915,1,," as noted above, this viewpoint is often used to make the case that hip hop’s fans are likely to engage in criminal behaviour.
",
3916,1,,"the use offorms to shut down urban music events or to justify intensified policing at concerts touches directly on many of the issues contained in principle 1.
",
3917,1,," plainly, closing down a musical event based on a tenuous connection between the style of the music that will be performed and the behaviour of the audience is denial of self-expression.
",
3918,1,," crucially, however, the disproportionate targeting of hip hop and associated musical forms by the police, taken alongside comments made by high ranking politicians such as david cameron also suggests that it is seen as an inferior form of speech, one that can be freely censored and displaced because it contains no socially valuable content.
",
3919,1,,"the capstone of this misleading approach to the sometimes violent and controversial content of hip hop music is the attitude of public authorities to those who consume and produce it.
",
3920,1,," broadcasters of hip hop music have been accused of encouraging knife crime and violent muggings; stickers advising ‘parental guidance’ are regularly attached to hip hop albums.
",
3921,1,," at the height of civil unrest in london duringthe prominent historian david starky commented that ‘a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion,’ and that ‘black and white, boy and girl operate in this language together.
",
3922,1,," this language, which is wholly false, which is this jamaican patois that has intruded in england [sic].’
",
3923,1,,"the result of such comments is the demonization of hip hop artists and the infantilisation of their fans.
",
3924,1,," both these trends are effective in obstructing free speech.
",
3925,1,," once again, they deny the veracity and authenticity of a particular type of free expression under the aegis of protecting the public from criminality.
",
3926,1,," in addition, such comments seek to portray the audiences that hip hop attracts as gullible and overly impressionable, adding an additional stereotype to a constellation of already damaging assumptions.
",
3927,1,,"reactionary attempts to shut down music venues and censor hip hop are no replacement for an equitable and even handed assessment of the content of hip hop music.
",
3928,1,," violence, even in its glamorised form, will always be part of popular culture, but it is telling that we only begin to find it objectionable when it threatens to bring the problems and realities of life at the margins of society into the mainstream – when fictional glamour reflects too closely on real-life social breakdown.”
",
3929,0,,"- alexander cavellwe should expect fans of an art form that is subjected to public criticism and vilification to leap to its defence .
",
3930,0,," some of these aficionados - whether the medium in question is cinema , fine art or pop music - make the case for the value of their favourite mode of expression by overstating its positive effects .
",
3931,0,," hip hop has long been the focus of controversies surrounding violent music .
",
3932,0,," hip hop is closely associated with low-level criminality , as noted above .
",
3933,0,," a number of highly successful hip hop artists have been attacked or killed as a result of feuds within the industry and links between managers , promoters and criminal gangs .
",
3934,0,," as the academic john mcwhorter has pointed out in numerous publications , the positive political and social impact of rap music has been massively overstated , as a result of highly charged media coverage of hip hop-linked violence .
",
3935,0,," as a result , attempts to address some of the hips hops most objectionable content - lyrics that are misogynist and blankly and uncritically violent - have been condemned as unjust assaults on the right to free expression .
",
3936,0,," attacks on negative content in hip hop have been made all the more emotive , because they appear to be an attempt to restrict the speech of members of vulnerable and marginalised communities .
",
3937,0,," side proposition agrees with mcwhorter that listening to music that contains violent themes will not , in the absence of other factors , cause individuals to behave in a violent way .
",
3938,0,," however , the content of rap , and its strong links with the youngest inhabitants of marginalised , stigmatised urban areas mean that it damages the developmental opportunities of teenagers and young people , and harms others ' perceptions of the communities they live in .
",
3939,0,," hip hop trades on its authenticity -- the extent to which it faithfully portrays the lived experience of the inhabitants of deprived inner city areas .
",
3940,0,," the greater the veracity of a hip hop track , the greater its popularity and cache among fans .
",
3941,0,," musicians have gained public recognition as a result of being directly involved in street crime and gang activities .
",
3942,0,," 50 cent , a high profile `` gansta '' artist owes his popularity , in part , to a shooting inthat left him withbullet wounds .
",
3943,0,," this supposed link to reality is the most dangerous aspect of contemporary hip hop culture .
",
3944,0,," unlike the simplistic make-believe of , say , action films , the `` experiences '' related by rappers are also their public personas and become the rationale for their success .
",
3945,0,," rap , through materialist boasting and sexualised music videos tells vulnerable young men and women from isolated neighbourhoods that their problems can be solved by adopting similarly nihilistic personas .
",
3946,0,," the poverty that affects many of the communities that hip hop artists identify with does more than separate individuals from economic opportunity .
",
3947,0,," it also confines the inhabitants of these communities geographically , politically and culturally .
",
3948,0,," it prevents young men and women from becoming aware of perspectives on the world and society that run contrary to the violence of main stream rap .
",
3949,0,," with television dominated by the gangsta motif , marginalised youngsters are left with little in the way of dissenting voices to convince them that hip hop takes a subjective and commercialised approach to the lives and communities that rappers claim to represent .
",
3950,0,," in effect , controversial hip hop is capable of sponsoring violent behaviour , when it is marketed as an accurate portrayal of relationships , values and principles .
",
3951,0,," under these circumstances , adolescents , whose own identity is nascent and malleable can easily be misled into emulating the exploits and attitudes of rappers .
",
3952,0,," side proposition advocates the control and classification of controversial forms of music , including but not limited to hip hop .
",
3953,0,," consistent with principlesand, classification of this type will follow similar schemes applied to movies and videogames .
",
3954,0,," assessments of the content of music will be conducted by a politically independent organisation ; musicians and record companies will have the ability to appeal the decisions of this body .
",
3955,0,," crucially , the `` ban '' on music containing violent lyrics will take the form of a categorisation scheme .
",
3956,0,," content will not be blocked from sale or censored .
",
3957,0,," instead , as with the sale of pornographic material in many liberal democratic states , music found to contain especially violent lyrics will be confined to closed off areas in shops , to which only adults , as defined in law , will be admitted .
",
3958,0,," its performance on television , radio and in cinemas will be banned .
",
3959,0,," live performances of restricted music will be obliged to enforce strict age monitoring policies .
",
3960,0,," online distributors of music will be compelled to comply with similar age restrictions and intentionally exposing minors to violent music will be punishable under child protection laws .
",
3961,0,," this approach has the advantage of limiting access to violent content only to consumers who are judged , in general , to be mature enough to understand that its `` message '' and the posturing of singers does not equate to permission to engage in deviant behaviour .
",
3962,0,," the enforcement of the laws proposed in this article will be fraught , complex and difficult .
",
3963,0,," however , the difficulty of administering a law is never a good argument for refusing to enforce it .
",
3964,0,," the censorship of the written word ended in england with the lady chatterley and oz obscenity trials , but this liberalisation of publication standards has not prevented the state from prosecuting hate speech when it appears in print .
",
3965,0,," it is clear that , although we have more latitude than ever to say or write what we want , no matter how objectionable , standards and taboos continue to exist .
",
3966,0,," we can take it that these taboos are especially important and valuable to the running of a stable society , as they have persisted despite the legal and cultural changes that have taken place over the last fifty years .
",
3967,0,," hate speech is prosecuted and censored because of its power to intrude into the lives of individuals who have not consented to receive it .
",
3968,0,," as pointed out in jeremy waldron 's response to timothy garton ash 's piece on hate speech , hateful comments are not dangerous because they insight gullible individuals to abandon their inhibitions and engage in race riots .
",
3969,0,," hate speech is harmful because it recreates - cheaply and in front of a very large audience - an atmosphere in which vulnerable minorities are put in fear of becoming the targets of violence and prejudice .
",
3970,0,," additionally , hate speech harms by defaming groups , by propagating lies and half-truths about practices and beliefs , with the objective of socially isolating those groups .
",
3971,0,," gangsta rap does all of these things , yet legal responses to the publication of songs containing such lyrics as `` rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome , '' have been timid at best .
",
3972,0,," even if we maintain our liberal approach to taboo breaking forms of expression , we can still link hip hop to many of the harms that hate speech produces .
",
3973,0,," gangsta rap gives the impression that african-american and latin-american neighbourhoods throughout the usa are violent , lawless places .
",
3974,0,," even if the pronouncements of rappers such ascent and nwa are overblown or fictitious they enforce social division by vividly discouraging people from entering or interacting with poor minority communities .
",
3975,0,," they damage those communities directly by creating a fear of criminality that serves to limit trust and cohesion among individual community members .
",
3976,0,," finally , violent hip hop is also defamatory .
",
3977,0,," it propagates an image of minority communities that emphasises violence , poverty and nihilism , whilst loudly proclaiming its authenticity .
",
3978,0,," it is completely irrelevant that these images of minority communities are produced by members of those communities .
",
3979,0,," it is on this basis , however protracted the process of classification must become , that the content of hip hop songs should be assessed and censored .
",
3980,0,," liberal democracies are prepared to go to great lengths to adjudicate on speech that could potentially promote racial or religious hatred .
",
3981,0,," the same standards should be applied to hip hop music , because it is capable of producing identical harms .
",
3982,0,," the intervention of the state is necessary in order to ensure that aggressive forms of hip hop remain accessible only to adults , especially in neighbourhoods and home environments that are not part of a cohesive , caring community .
",
3983,0,," some degree of public control over the content of hip hop will also help to preserve the diversity , accessibility of the genre in the face of commercial dominance by violent forms of rap .
",
3984,0,," mainstream success in hip hop has become synonymous with gangsta rap , and with artists who have backgrounds that lend veracity to their lurid verses .
",
3985,0,," however , many of these supposedly `` authentic '' experiences consist of little more than exaggeration and invented personas .
",
3986,0,," when being interviewed about the controversial content of her son 's single `` fuck tha ' police '' , the mother of rapper ice cube commented that `` i do n't see , him , saying those curse words .
",
3987,0,," i see him like an actor . ''
",
3988,0,," the existence of pornography attests to the market for forms of media that fulfil base and simplistic human fantasies .
",
3989,0,," much the same can be said for the violent and cynical content of rap singles .
",
3990,0,," unlike the relationship between cinema and pornography , however , many commentators appear to regard gangsta rap as being synonymous with hip hop -- a position as deceptive as a film critic claiming that all movies are inevitably tied to pornography .
",
3991,0,," the significant public profile and poor regulation of hip hop have meant that gangsta rap fans have become the genre 's dominant class of consumer .
",
3992,0,," the amount of money that fans are willing to spend on singles , albums , concert tickets and associated branded goods means that labels that cultivate relationships with gangsta rappers have become the gatekeepers of the hip hop genre in general .
",
3993,0,," `` conscious '' rappers , who do not glorify violence , along with musicians working in other hip hop genres must work with labels that promote acts containing violent lyrics in order to publish their own music .
",
3994,0,," either consciously , or by design , the terrain of contemporary hip hop is hostile to musicians who are not prepared to discuss `` guns , bitches and bling '' in their work .
",
3995,0,," this constitutes a significant barrier to rappers ability to communicate novel messages and listeners ' ability to receive them .
",
3996,0,," it could be called a market failure -- the pervasive public presence of gangsta rap has effectively denied an audience to other rappers .
",
3997,0,," classification has the potential to maximise the freedom and effectiveness of musical expression by hip hop artists who choose not to trade in brutality and misogyny .
",
3998,0,," the alternative is to allow hip hop to continue to be dominated by businesses such as death row records , low life records and machete music .
",
3999,0,," this will lead to hip hop as a medium becoming inextricably linked with violent lyrics and the dubious businesses practices of gangsta labels ' bosses .
",
4000,0,," popular disengagement is much more likely under these circumstances , and will actively deny a voice , and opportunities , to musicians with a different perspective on hip hop .
",
4001,1,,"to mark the 70th anniversary of the death of the turkish republic’s founder, kemal atatürk, in november 2008, journalist and documentary filmmaker can dündar set out to produce, “the complete story of atatürk [which] has been told neither to turkey nor to the rest of the world.”
",
4002,1,," showing the “complete story” on the silver screen meant showing atatürk in his full humanity, including his fondness for women and alcohol.
",
4003,1,," although some audiences argued there was nothing new about atatürk in the documentary, it attracted fierce criticism on the grounds that it was insulting the country’s founder atatürk, and indirectly “turkishness” – an offence punishable by law under articleof the turkish penal code.
",
4004,1,,"some urged the public to refrain from watching the documentary, and under no circumstances allow children to see it, as it would belittle atatürk’s image in their minds.
",
4005,1,," others argued that the documentary was part of a plot against turkish secularism, believing that kemalists would lose their attachment to a leader who was a “drunken debaucher”.
",
4006,1,," two doctors even went to court in the hope of getting the film banned on the grounds that it shows atatürk as a chain smoker – showing smoking on film and television is illegal in turkey.
",
4007,1,," although the film was not banned, and perhaps also due to the fierce debate in the media, it attracted a wide audience.
",
4008,1,," can dündar’s personal website was blocked in schools at the request of the ministry of education who argued its content was “unfavourable” for students and teachers.
",
4009,1,,"we think all sides of national heroes, be it their smoking or drinking habits should be discussed.
",
4010,1,," the human side of national heroes might sound insulting to some, but unless we learn everything about them, our impression of our leaders would be unbalanced and highly biased.
",
4011,1,," by criticising dündar to this extent, the turkish audience, particularly the devote kemalists, showed that any criticism of atatürk was taboo and would not be welcome.
",
4012,1,," consequently, this fierce criticism was an example of how legitimate and important debate about a national hero could be deterred and how national heroes can be turned into taboos.
",
4013,0,,"- irem kok and funda ustekno country is whiter than white , and often the creation of a country is a bloody event that involves mistakes , tragedy 's and outright massacres .
",
4014,0,," while it is wrong to cover up and not apologise when mistakes are made or horrifying acts are committed the results of this action are likely to have consequences .
",
4015,0,," these events may well be a sour point with neighbouring countries or even just those who feel that the country is not being honest about its past .
",
4016,0,," turkey is an excellent example of this .
",
4017,0,," almost everyone would agree that atatürk was a great leader and most would not consider that his habits make any difference to this .
",
4018,0,," nor are they likely to judge turkey on the basis of the foibles of a long dead leader .
",
4019,0,," however during the period just before atatürk became president the armenian genocide occurred , 1915-23 , which stains turkey 's foreign relations to this day , france has supported a law criminalising its denial , the us congress has several times had bills proposed highlighting the genocide and so damaging turkey 's relations with the u.s. and of course helping to freeze relations with armenia itself .
",
4020,0,," history is not something that it is worth sacrificing freedom of speech and expression for .
",
4021,0,," every individual should be free to voice their own views and this includes on areas that are important to the state such as its formation and national heros .
",
4022,0,," in these areas there can be no compelling reason for keeping secrets or discouraging open inquiry and scholarship , there are no national security interests at stake , for most countries the individuals involved are dead .
",
4023,0,," therefore the only thing being affected are individuals posthumous reputations and the state should not be protecting individuals reputations .
",
4024,0,," someone 's reputation should stand on all of their deeds and acts based upon fact not just a cherry picked and idealised image set forth by the state .
",
4025,0,," the foundation of islam is potentially an example of this .
",
4026,0,," some scholars such as tom holland have attempted to show that the arab empire gave birth to islam rather than the other way around as it is traditionally understood .
",
4027,0,," possible revisions of the early history of islam are extremely controversial but in light of the conflicts in the middle east and what is sometimes described as a clash of civilizations between the west and islam it is important that the period be studied .
",
4028,0,," holland suggests that the prophet may have been much more influenced by christianity and judaism than is recognised by islam ; if there were such links might unearthing them not help to heal divides today ?
",
4029,0,," history is important because of the way it shapes attitudes and identities .
",
4030,0,," nationalism scholar benedict anderson has dubbed nations ` imagined communities ' because `` members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members , meet them , or even hear of them , yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion . ''
",
4031,0,," this is the case with all large scale communities .
",
4032,0,," `` the nation is always conceived as a deep , horizontal comradeship '' a fraternity for which members are willing to kill and die .
",
4033,0,," this very willingness makes nationalism potentially dangerous and so it is much better to take a much more measured approach seeing the bad as well as the good .
",
4034,0,," yet because the nation is an imagined community so it is possible for that imagining to be altered as is needed .
",
4035,0,," turkey will not cease being the turkish nation simply because views of atatürk change as a result of some believing him to be a ` drunken debaucher ' .
",
4036,0,," other countries have come to accept negative parts of their history with little consequence for their conception of the nation such as the uk 's acceptance that imperialism was in large part negative it simply creates a more nuanced view of the past .
",
4037,0,," while the state may like to whitewash history to produce its own ` national history ' that sticks to one grand narrative that is about the state this is not history as it really is .
",
4038,0,," while a national history full of patriotism may be good for instilling a love of the nation it is not much use at teaching anything else .
",
4039,0,," in particular it is damaging to any attempt to teach analysis and the use of sources through history .
",
4040,0,," history is for the most part not useful in and of itself , there are for example very few jobs directly working with history .
",
4041,0,," rather teaching of history emphasises ` transferrable skills ' such as critical analysis , reasoning and argument all of which are suppressed if focused on one officially approved narrative .
",
4042,0,," moreover having the darker side of a nation 's past both makes history more interesting and more believable and so making it more likely that those being taught it will relate to it .
",
4043,0,," making the past look whiter than white simply makes it seem out of touch with reality .
",
4044,0,," it makes for a poor teacher as history needs to ` teach by example ' and if that example is not a complex character that can be related to it has little relation to every day experience .
",
4045,1,,"the british media has long resisted any formal regulation as an industry and many feel that there has been a tendency among some members of the profession to abuse this fact.
",
4046,1,," certainly the british tabloid press has a reputation worldwide for being more aggressive and invasive than many comparable publications around the world.
",
4047,1,," the scandal led to the closure of the sunday paper the news of the world (now) and has now engulfed the whole of news international, seeing both rupert and james murdoch facing questions from a parliamentary committee and arrest warrants being handed out to senior staff.
",
4048,1,,"proponents of greater regulation point not only to the excesses of the tabloid press- of which phone hacking is simply the most recent example- but to their obsession with celebrity gossip and the extents to which they will go to get it.
",
4049,1,," for example the paparazzi associated with the british tabloids were widely criticised for the pursuit of princess diana, actions which were believed by many to have led to her death.
",
4050,1,," it has also been alleged that they are quicker to publish stories than to retract them when they are demonstrated to be false.
",
4051,1,,"the issue is far from simple.
",
4052,1,," as alan rusbridger, editor of the left-liberal daily broadsheet the guardian, pointed out to the inquiry, it was an investigative journalist that broke the story of phone-hacking.
",
4053,1,," the right-wing daily mail also vaulted its role in bringing the murderers of stephen lawrence to book after extensive campaigning during and after the police’s investigation into the crime.
",
4054,1,,"an additional complicating factor was the involvement of senior figures in the british establishment- notably politicians and senior police officers- in varying degrees of collusion with the media.
",
4055,1,," this last factor is particularly difficult, as it raises the issue of who would be in a position to regulate the press.
",
4056,1,," it will clearly impact upon the ability of the media to root out corruption in either political circles or within the police force or judiciary if any of those bodies has direct control over them.
",
4057,1,," on the other hand they have proved spectacularly incapable of regulating themselves.
",
4058,1,,"on a practical note, it is tempting to commit a slippery slope fallacy in this debate – the idea that regulating the press is the first step on the road to a totalitarian state where the media is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the government.
",
4059,1,," there may well be some truth in this but it is important not to overplay it.
",
4060,0,," in the age of the internet and with no shortage of opposition politicians it would be hard to see how the tabloid press could be much more slavishly loyal to whichever party they may have chosen to back at a given time.
",
4061,0,,"the phone hacking scandal is simply a new low in the recent , tawdry life of the tabloid press .
",
4062,0,," as the leveson inquiry is discovering , the use of private detectives , bribing police officers , and trailing the children of celebrities all seem to be common tricks not just for the news of the world but for tabloid journalism as an industry .
",
4063,0,," the media increasingly resembles one of the drug addicts it is usually so keen to condemn .
",
4064,0,," as competition over dwindling advertising revenue becomes increasingly bitter , papers become ever more desperate for the next hit story -- normally represented by celebrity gossip or a minor scandal .
",
4065,0,," such content has nothing to do with bold investigative journalism and everything to do with muck-racking for salacious stories and - when that does n't work - simply fabricating them .
",
4066,0,," creating the impression that millie dowler was still alive was simply the most grotesque of a series of activities that put sales way ahead of truth .
",
4067,0,," in an age when any fool with a cell phone and a twitter account can snap a topless pop star on the beach , tabloid hacks are under greater pressure than ever to go the extra mile .
",
4068,0,," there is little reason to doubt that they will .
",
4069,0,," privacy is already one of the dominant legal issues of our age that looks likely to become ever more the case .
",
4070,0,," against that background , when a flat out lie can be broadcast around the world in seconds , clearly a different legal and regulatory framework is needed from the old days of print where an apology was actually relevant -- however begrudgingly given .
",
4071,1,,"the way that the rushdie issue has been handled by the indian government is shameful, and is representative of how all political parties in india pander to right-wing religious agendas just before any election (in this case, the up state elections starting in mid-february).
",
4072,1,," however, i feel that if a battle has to be fought for the right to freedom of expression, then the soldiers fighting that battle need to display some more courage than rushdie and the organisers of the festival managed to muster.
",
4073,1,," it was clear from the very outset that there was no credible threat to rushdie’s life, and that the security needed for his personal safety could have easily been arranged.
",
4074,1,," even though there was a real risk of the festival being disrupted by protesters, this was a risk which the organisers and rushdie should have taken in order to defend the sanctity of the right to freedom of speech.
",
4075,1,," by cancelling not just the visit, but also the video link, the organisers and rushdie have further emboldened the fanatical elements in india and sent them the message that these kind of scare tactics are indeed an effective way of pressurising people into silence.
",
4076,1,,"this issue is said to have ‘divided muslims from westerners along the fault line of culture’ and pits the western value of freedom of expression against the view of many muslims that nobody should be permitted to insult or malign the muslim faith.
",
4077,0,," society has a right to choose and structure its values as it sees fit and there is no reason why the western construction of values is right or should take priority over any other .
",
4078,0,," in muslim countries faith may be a more important aspect of life that it might be in western countries and it is entirely legitimate that those societies might choose to value protecting the dignity of their faith over absolute freedom of speech .
",
4079,0,," india 's post-independence history is one of partition along religious grounds with pakistan and then open warfare with that state over territory .
",
4080,0,," there is still a large muslim minority in india and there are deep underlying social tensions within the country on this basis , along with frosty relations with a nuclear-capable pakistan .
",
4081,0,," in this context , india 's leaders have a special reason to pay attention to the sensibilities of their minority populations .
",
4082,0,," if allowing the publication of the satanic verses would result in social unrest then on the balance of harms it is a rational choice to make a limited restriction on freedom of speech rather than see potential millions having their property and lives threatened .
",
4083,1,,"three days after the broadcast, radio producer antony pitts resigned, saying the bbc had flouted its own guidelines and brushed off complaints.
",
4084,1,," bbc director-general mark thompson stood by the corporation’s decision: “i am a practicing christian, but there is nothing in this which i believe to be blasphemous.”
",
4085,1,,"one organisation, christian voice, failed in its efforts to sue the bbc for blasphemous libel after two high court judges ruled that broadcasters and theatres could not be prosecuted under this offence.
",
4086,1,," they added that as a parody of jerry springer, the us chat show, and not of christianity, the programme could not be deemed blasphemous.
",
4087,0,,"- maryam omiditherefore , those who watched it made a choice to do so -- and it seems reasonable to consider that an informed choice .
",
4088,0,," a free society is predicated on the fact that adults have the right to make choices .
",
4089,0,," in turn that is based on the shared understanding that those choices have consequences ; which may , potentially , cause some degree of harm to the person making that choice .
",
4090,0,," having been warned that watching the broadcast may cause them offence , viewers still chose to and some , it seems , were duly offended .
",
4091,0,," it seems reasonable , therefore , to assume that the shock was either feigned or a matter of pretence .
",
4092,0,," which leaves the matter of blasphemy ; an offence against a belief system .
",
4093,0,," there was no secret that religious issues were likely to feature in the broadcast and no secret was made of the fact that those views were likely to be both critical and forthright .
",
4094,0,," tuning in , specifically to be offended by something that the viewer had been warned they might find offensive seems perverse .
",
4095,0,," by contrast , art lovers who wished to see the production - which had received four lawrence olivier awards among other tributes -- had the opportunity to experience a theatrical work they would have had a limited opportunity to witness had it not been broadcast nationally .
",
4096,0,," many perceive commonly held positions in the mainstream churches -- let alone more extreme sects -- to be offensive or reactionary and , in some cases , a cover for homophobic , illiberal or sexist opinions .
",
4097,0,," if religious opinion is to be granted this airtime for the benefit of a small , if vocal , minority then it seems both unfair and unprofessional for that broadcaster to be constrained by that groups views in relation to the rest of its output .
",
4098,0,," the bbc , like most major broadcasters , meets the challenge of divergent or conflicting views by providing some output that is considered likely to be of interest to each viewpoint .
",
4099,0,," the bbc is in an unusual position , simply because of its funding structure , to promote new or challenging works of art .
",
4100,0,," the licence fee means that it is freed of many of the pressures brought to bear by either commercial or political masters .
",
4101,0,," although it has never taken that to mean it has a carte blanche , it does allow for opportunities simply not available to many broadcasters in terms showcasing new works of art and encouraging creative development .
",
4102,0,," it seems reasonable to suggest that many of those millions follow the bbc because they trust the corporation 's approach of providing the widest possible range of output and opinion .
",
4103,0,," for such an organisation to capitulate to a prudish group -- who were outside bbc venues at the time so could n't have seen the broadcast -- would be a huge betrayal of that trust .
",
4104,0,," the bbc would quickly be left with a content either devoid of interest or of content were it to allow such a veto to become normative .
",
4105,0,," especially were it , as appears to be the case here , to offer such a veto to people who did n't watch the programme .
",
4106,0,," as a result , although some of the responsibility for avoiding offence lies with the broadcaster at least an equal share must lie with the viewer .
",
4107,0,," even at the more basic level of ` will i like this ' , responsibility lies with both parties .
",
4108,0,," the bbc undertakes to provide a diverse range of programming so that there is a reasonable chance that the overwhelming majority should be able to find something of interest but does so on the assumption that people will watch what they find interesting .
",
4109,0,," likewise , it is reasonable to assume that people will not go out of their way to watch things that they already expect to find offensive .
",
4110,1,,"human rights come from the need to protect individuals from the arbitrary power of the state.
",
4111,1,," human rights are “international norms that help to protect all people everywhere from severe political, legal, and social abuses.”
",
4112,1,," there have been attempts to codify human rights internationally through agreements particularly the universal declaration of human rights signed in 1948.
",
4113,1,," this listed a large number of political, social and economic rights that are supposed to be universally held.
",
4114,1,," despite this there is no universally followed list of rights and there is the possibility that more human rights may over time become recognised or become necessary where there was not the need before.
",
4115,1,," internet access is an obvious example of this; the internet was only invented inand the world wide web in 1989.
",
4116,1,," as the internet has become a vital conduit for information only in the last decade it could not have been considered a human right only a few decades ago.
",
4117,1,,"just as there is no definitive list of human rights that is universally recognised what exactly the criteria for what a right into a human right is open for dispute.
",
4118,1,," the human rights reference handbook characterises them as being:several other features of human rights may also be added to these.
",
4119,1,," they are based upon the relationship between government and the people rather than two individuals, and the responsibility for these rights primarily falls upon the government.
",
4120,1,," they are minimal standards; what we cannot fall below rather than what we would like to have.
",
4121,1,," as they are universal they need to have strong justifications that can apply everywhere so that they can be recognised in all cultures.
",
4122,1,," this potentially provides a high threshold for considering a right to be a human right.
",
4123,1,,"internet access might be considered a human right in and of itself in which case there is a need for the concept of internet access to meet the above conditions; however it could equally be argued that internet access is already a human right as a part of human rights that already exist, particularly the freedom of expression.
",
4124,1,,"“a human right to internet access is an interesting concept that needs to be explored.
",
4125,1,," it directly relates to how we fulfil the first draft principle “we – all human beings – must be free and able to express ourselves, and to receive and impart information and ideas, regardless of frontiers.”
",
4126,1,," the internet is the greatest tool of communication invented so far.
",
4127,1,," it is however becoming much more than this but a separate social sphere in itself.
",
4128,1,," a human right to internet access may well be necessary to ensure everyone is able to interact in this sphere.”
",
4129,0,," - alex helling access to the internet can be considered a separate human right in and of itself .
",
4130,0,," the un special rapporteur in junepublished a report that implied that access to the internet is a human right `` the special rapporteur remains concerned that legitimate online expression is being criminalized in contravention of states ' international human rights obligations . ''
",
4131,0,," the right to internet access can meet the necessary conditions to be a human right ; as a right is should be universal , everyone should have access not just a few .
",
4132,0,," the internet is becoming much more than just a tool but is becoming a fundamental part of society creating a new sphere of interaction that everyone has a right to have access to .
",
4133,0,," creating a right to internet access would be addressing a specific contemporary problem as with other human rights that are specific such as a right to basic schooling , enshrined in articleof the universal declaration of human rights .
",
4134,0,," not having access to the internet is similar to not having basic schooling ; it considerably narrows people 's options and their horizons .
",
4135,0,," as tim berners-lee , the founder of the world wide web , argues `` given the many ways the web is crucial to our lives and our work , disconnection is a form of deprivation of liberty . ''
",
4136,0,," in our traditional human rights there is a hole when it comes to a right to receive and be able to seek out information .
",
4137,0,," almost everyone would consider freedom of speech and freedom of expression to be human rights but these rights are not very effective if there is not a way for those who wish to access that information .
",
4138,0,," michael l best contends that articleof the universal declaration of human rights on freedom of expression implies some symmetry but that freedom of authorship is privileged over freedom of readership .
",
4139,0,," in short governments could allow freedom of expression while ensuring that those expressing dissenting views have a very minimal audience without breaking human rights .
",
4140,0,," a right to the internet is the perfect human right to fill this gap .
",
4141,0,," the internet is estimated to have overbillion web pages , and the most recent digital universe study estimates that 1.8 trillion gigabytes would be created in.
",
4142,0,," the sheer size of the internet means that it is the ideal medium for providing this right to access information .
",
4143,0,," the internet is also increasingly accessible to everyone making it possible to be considered universal ; it is no longer something that the poor can not hope to have access to .
",
4144,0,," there are already over 2.1 billion people using the internet worldwide includingmillion in africa .
",
4145,0,," freedom of expression and speech and freedom of information is a fundamental freedom and is articlein the universal declaration of human rights .
",
4146,0,," this is usually taken to have three parts for governments to uphold : a duty to respect , for the government not to interfere with the freedom to impart information , a duty to protect , preventing interference with lawful communications and , a duty to fulfil , a duty to provide government held information .
",
4147,0,," access to the internet falls within this .
",
4148,0,," the duty to respect means that governments can not block access for people wishing to use the internet to express themselves .
",
4149,0,," the duty to protect means government should prevent others from interfering with internet users and the duty to fulfil could easily be taken just a little bit further to having to provide access to the internet .
",
4150,0,," freedom of expression therefore covers a freedom to access the internet as it already provides for a freedom to access mediums to express ones ' self .
",
4151,1,,"free speech is a fundamental human right; everyone, everywhere has an inalienable right to give their opinions.
",
4152,1,," today the internet is the frontier where free speech and state attempts to control it collide.
",
4153,1,," as the internet is this frontier there are today questions of whether internet access may be a human right and whether states that are considered free should attempt to defend the principle of internet freedom against illegitimate encroachments in non-democratic countries.
",
4154,1,,"for a time the internet was the only uncensored outlet for criticism of governments that have the traditional media under their thumb however this rapidly changed as authoritarian governments recognised that to stay in power they need to control the internet.
",
4155,1,," many non-democratic regimes, as well as a few democratic ones, engage in censorship particularly over internal news relating to that country.
",
4156,1,," china’s ‘great firewall’ is the most notorious censorship system and employs forty thousand internet police to monitor the country’s millions of web users.
",
4157,1,," however many more countries have some form of censorship in operation, much of this involving blocking content that is perceived as being against the sitting government.anti-government protests in burma inand in iran during its“green revolution” showed the importance of the internet to protest movements with social media being used to get information out to the rest of the world as well as to organise protests.
",
4158,1,," even major news outlets and foreign diplomats gained much of their information on the protests from social networks.
",
4159,1,," attempts by these two governments to cut the flow of information and shut the internet down during these protests also stimulated efforts to develop tools to help protestors bypass government’s censorship efforts.
",
4160,1,," for example there was widespread coverage of a program called haystack that was created to provide a secure route to anonomise users identities and so provide a safe way to communicate with the world.
",
4161,1,," while haystack unfortunately did not work it did provide impetus to the idea that the response from the international community to human rights violations could in part be technological.
",
4162,1,," countries such as the united states and united kingdom are increasingly using their aid budgets to help freedom of expression on the internet.
",
4163,1,," in aprilwilliam hague, british foreign secretary, promised an additional £1.5 million specifically for this purpose.
",
4164,1,,"   “the second free speech debate principle is “we defend the internet and all other forms of communication against illegitimate encroachments by both public and private powers.”
",
4165,1,," leads to the question of how we defend the internet.
",
4166,1,," one of the options to defend freedom on the internet is creating software to help evade censorship so keeping the internet open to all.
",
4167,1,," human rights are a bread and butter issue for foreign aid and the internet is now one of the key battle grounds for freedom of speech.
",
4168,1,," activists are unlikely to be able to match their states on their own; foreign aid can help redress the balance.”
",
4169,0,," - alex helling articleof the universal declaration of human rights defines freedom of speech as `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . ''
",
4170,0,," it is something innate in humans to have opinions and to want to express them to others and within a few limits governments have a duty to allow this freedom of expression .
",
4171,0,," where governments are not allowing this freedom of information this affects not only those whose opinions are being suppressed but those who can not hear their opinions .
",
4172,0,," the right to the freedom to receive and seek this information is just as important as the right to voice these opinions .
",
4173,0,," moreover as stated in articlethis is `` regardless of frontiers '' ; those outside a country have just as much right to hear these opinions as those inside .
",
4174,0,," government aid programs from democracies in western europe and america are already concerned with promoting human rights including freedom of speech .
",
4175,0,," australia 's aid program for example has a human rights fund of $ 6.5 million per year that provides grants to among other things `` educate and/or train human rights victims , workers or defenders '' .
",
4176,0,," enabling victims of human rights abuse to get around their government 's censorship is the obvious next step .
",
4177,0,," the concept of the ` responsibility to protect ' introduced by the international commission on intervention and state sovereignty inprovided that when governments were unable or unwilling to protect their own citizens then that responsibility devolves to the international community and may ultimately lead to military action for particularly gross violations .
",
4178,0,," this responsibility to react should be `` with appropriate measures '' and for the breach of the human right of freedom of expression providing a method to enable those whose freedom of expression/speech is being violated to exercise this right is the most appropriate and proportional response .
",
4179,0,," if democracies are to provide money to help dissidents then this option of funding research into and distributing software to defeat censors is the easiest way in which to help these dissidents .
",
4180,0,," those who are trying to exercise their freedom of speech do not want help in the form of military intervention or diplomatic representations rather they want to have the space and capacity to exercise those freedoms .
",
4181,0,," the internet means that for the first time it is possible for external actors to provide that platform for freedom of speech without having to take those who wish to exercise these freedoms outside of the country that is violating those freedoms .
",
4182,0,," the internet is very important in the economies of many authoritarian regimes .
",
4183,0,," in china for example there aremillion online shoppers and the e-commerce market is worth almost $billion and could be worth over $billion by.
",
4184,0,," as a result authoritarian regimes ca n't easily just turn off the internet and ignore it so long as they want their economy to operate .
",
4185,0,," as a result except in extreme cases such as north korea or for particularly prominent dissidents who are locked up physical access to the internet is unlikely to be denied .
",
4186,0,," so long as there is physical access to the internet it will be possible to help by providing ways to avoid firewalls so that they can access information their state has banned and express opinions to both the outside world and their compatriots .
",
4187,0,," it is equally important to provide ways for these people to avoid being tracked by the authorities so as to prevent retaliation against them for evading censorship .
",
4188,0,," while haystack was a failure there have been other projects that are receiving state department funding that may be more successful such as ` intheclear ' which provides a `` panic button '' app for smart phones allowing contents to be quickly erased and prewritten texts sent so having the dual effect of making it more difficult for those making the arrest to find out what the user was doing and raising the alarm that this person has been arrested .
",
4189,0,," this technology helps meet a clear need ; egyptian democracy activists when asked what kind of technology they needed most said they wanted safer cellphones .
",
4190,0,," most government aid budgets are small and have numerous other important calls on their resources such as development aid .
",
4191,0,," betweenandthe united states congress funded the effort against internet censorship with $million .
",
4192,0,," while this may sound like a lot compared to the $million of aid to liberia and $million to unicef init is not a large commitment .
",
4193,0,," yet due to the nature of the internet small investments can have immense benefits .
",
4194,0,," money spent on food aid will buy enough food to feed a limited amount of people yet if a technology is developed that allows internet users to get around censors and not be tracked then hundreds of millions would benefit .
",
4195,0,," it would at the same time have the incalculable benefit of making it more difficult for authorities to track and crack down on those who are breaking the authorities ' censorship .
",
4196,1,,"mexican journalist carmen aristegui was fired for publicly calling on president felipe calderón to clarify rumours that he suffered from alcoholism, writes felipe correa.
",
4197,1,," allegations that politicians have problems with alcohol are common but rarely evidence-based, leading often to libel.
",
4198,1,," however, in the case that occurred in mexico it seems to me that the journalist was just commenting on an act that happened in the mexican congress, and asking for clarification from the president.
",
4199,1,," commenting on an event occurring in congress is different from claiming something in an investigative story.
",
4200,1,," in the case of rother, he did not report an event.
",
4201,1,," he did an investigation and wrote a story insinuating (giving no evidences, but rumours) that the brazilian president suffered from alcoholism.
",
4202,1,," in the case of aristegui, it is clear to me that it was not defamation and she shouldn’t have been dismissed- felipe correa debaters’ notethis is one specific example of a very common type of debate referred to as ‘public figures / private lives’.
",
4203,1,," it is also a huge issue in discussions about freedom of speech and the independence of the press.
",
4204,1,," if a politician is an alcoholic, or having an affair, or is gay, or takes drugs or a million other things does the public have any right to know?
",
4205,1,," more to the point in this case, if it is just gossip is there a public interest in it being more widely known that such gossip is taking place in political and journalistic circles?
",
4206,1,,"usually the issue comes down to whether;a)    the politician is being a hypocrite – backing homophobic legislation while at the same time living with a gay partner.
",
4207,1,,"b)    the issue is affecting the politician’s performance at work – missing meetings because she is drunk or hungover.
",
4208,1,,"c)    there is a possibility that the politician could be threatened with the release of the information – either though blackmail or internal political horse-trading.
",
4209,1,," it’s worth noting, the allegation doesn’t really need to be true for this to be a threat.
",
4210,1,,"d)    finally, can the journalist prove that there is a matter of public interest.
",
4211,1,," remember that the public interest is something much more than the public just being curious about a scandal – it means that there is a provable reason for revealing the information.
",
4212,0,,"in the light of this, these arguments have been kept deliberately broad but are set within the confines of the case set out above.
",
4213,0,,"the fact that by doing so she endangered not only her own reputation with the president 's office but that of the show and the company clearly makes it a disciplinary matter .
",
4214,0,," intruding on anyone 's private life unnecessarily is unpleasant invading the privacy of a figure with whom one is likely to need to work in the future is professional stupidity .
",
4215,0,," opposition parties in every democracy in the world produce stories or actions calling on those in power to do or say something ridiculous or making unfounded allegations just to get some coverage and damage their opponent 's credibility .
",
4216,0,," viewers and readers expect journalist to use their professional judgement in choosing where to give real stories the oxygen of publicity and when to ignore something as a publicity stunt .
",
4217,0,," unfurling banners in parliament is clearly the latter .
",
4218,0,," as a result journalists are able to present their audience with something they have good reason to believe is true .
",
4219,0,," instead aristegui , effectively , came up with `` well , some people said these , it might be true , it might not , someone should find out . ''
",
4220,0,," that ` someone ' should have been her .
",
4221,0,," by mentioning this at all on air , the rumour is given credibility that it did not deserve and the president 's reputation was unfairly sullied .
",
4222,0,," all of these things were well known by the journalists of their time but there was no need for the story to be revealed .
",
4223,0,," the allegation of the opposition was that calderón was a drunk , this then became a suggestion that he was an alcoholic -- they 're different things .
",
4224,0,," this rather suggests that now research at all was undertaken into the allegation but that a slur was repeated as though it were news .
",
4225,1,,"nimi hoffmandespite its limitations, the case of “penisgate” shows the high levels of public discussion and criticism in south africa, which are crucial to a deliberative democracy.
",
4226,1,," the question remains as to whether this case can be used to open the door to more constructive debates around gender equality, racial equality, and the politics of art.
",
4227,1,,"maryam omidicity press should not have yielded to the anc’s political bullying.
",
4228,1,," while i understand that the paper compromised a principle – in this case the right to free speech – for social harmony, i think it sets a harmful precedent.
",
4229,1,," it sends out the following message: intimidation can be used to chill freedom of expression.
",
4230,1,," the artwork may have been in bad taste, but this does not mean it should have been removed or banned.
",
4231,1,," provocative art challenges our commitment to free speech and we should tread carefully to ensure the right example is set.
",
4232,1,," if we dislike a creative work, we usually have the option of not hearing, viewing or reading it – as we did in this case.
",
4233,1,,"furthermore, through his art murray was making a political statement.
",
4234,1,," he was highlighting the corruption in zuma’s government – the artwork was part of an exhibition called hail to the thief – and making a judgement on the president’s controversial sexual relations, above all, the allegations of rape.
",
4235,1,," as president of the country, zuma should be open to a higher level of criticism and satire than the ordinary citizen.
",
4236,0,,"- nimi hoffmann and maryam omidia core principle of art is that it should be free from any form of inhibition , as the particular artwork is an expression of the particular views and ideals of the artist .
",
4237,0,," the subject matter in many instances is their own choice ; therefore they have the right to say what they want about the subject matter , safe in the knowledge that is their opinion alone being portrayed .
",
4238,0,," the artist that painted ` the spear ' , brett murray , created the piece as part of an exhibition that reflected his own discontent at the lack of major progress since the ruling african national congress took power in south africa after the end of apartheid in.
",
4239,0,," murray used his work to promulgate an idea that he has , allowing for others to see the art work for themselves and make up their own minds about president zuma and the anc .
",
4240,0,," art galleries have a right to display any artist they feel will attract visitors as well showcase the forms of art that they believe is suitable .
",
4241,0,," the goodman gallery saw no issue with murray 's work to the extent that they prevented any particular works from being displayed .
",
4242,0,," as it was their venue which was the setting for ` the spear 's display , the goodman gallery had the right to take decisions independently of external pressure .
",
4243,0,," the removal of the exhibit sets a dangerous precedent whereby government can unduly censor artworks , threatening the free actions of artists and the galleries that display their work in turn affecting plural , democratic discourse .
",
4244,0,," the removal of ` the spear ' from the goodman gallery and the city press also hints at a threat to pluralism , especially when one considers the political nature of the campaign to have such images removed .
",
4245,0,," while jacob zuma attempted to have the image banned in a personal capacity , the intensive campaigning by both the anc and the congress of south african trade unions , cosatu , against both the goodman gallery and city press hints at a dangerously political action taken by those with close access to power over the south african state .
",
4246,0,," this should be cause to worry .
",
4247,0,," chapter two of the constitution of south africa , in place since, protects freedoms such as freedom of speech and freedom of association .
",
4248,0,," the intimidation of art galleries and newspapers threatens the free exchange of ideas that occurs in these areas , as well sending an implicit image by its supports that criticism of the government can not be tolerated .
",
4249,0,," if neither the gallery nor city press removed the image of ` the spear ' from public view , then a clear message would have been sent that the principles of free speech , free association and freedom of intimidation outlined in the constitution is to be upheld at all times , regardless of who may take offence at what is being said .
",
4250,0,," it is important in the south african context to protect the right to criticise the government and voice opinions that vary from the ideals of the majority .
",
4251,0,," it is worrying what kind of message is sent by those close to the south african government that intimidation seems to be the appropriate response to criticism such as this rather than asking why such criticism is there in the first place .
",
4252,0,," some critics of ` the spear ' have criticised the artwork on the grounds that it ` dehumanises ' black people in general and president zuma in particular and criticises him based upon his personal life rather than policy , using vulgar means to do it .
",
4253,0,," this line of opposition is part of a dog-whistle tactic that the anc has consistently used against white critics of its government in the past .
",
4254,0,," anc criticisms of its white critics , including the opposition democratic alliance have made discreet reference to the injustices of the past as a means of creating distrust in the minds of poor , black voters who maintain anc support as a result .
",
4255,0,," some politicians within the anc , most notably the former president of its youth wing julius malema , have made incendiary statements that could be seen to stoke up hatred against whites .
",
4256,0,," it is against this back drop that the double standards over criticism of murray should be viewed .
",
4257,0,," murray , a white artist , has been criticised roundly for ` the spear ' , while black artists have created works that could be seen to denigrate president zuma in a similar manner to ` the spear ' .
",
4258,0,," a noticeable example is ` ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi ' , better a fool than a rich man 's nonsense , by ayanda mabulu , that carried a much more graphic depiction of the president and other leading politicians of the past and present with barely a murmur raised .
",
4259,0,," by bowing to the pressure exerted by the anc and its followers , the goodman gallery and city press have bowed to pressure , denying criticism of the government and accepting the implied view that white south africans are unable to criticise the government without seeking to re-assert any forms of superiority that had existed under apartheid .
",
4260,0,," whilst there may still be underlying problems of far-right activity in south africa , to smear anyone who criticises the government based on their race does nothing to help move the country on from autocracy and institutionalised racism .
",
4261,0,," the goodman gallery and city press should have stood by displaying the image as it represented the opinion of brett murray , free from intimidation or race based slander .
",
4262,1,,"(assange himself prefers the title “publisher and editor-in-chief who organises and directs other journalists”.)
",
4263,1,,"julian assange is a journalist, and should be treated as such.
",
4264,1,," the current debate rests on an archaic definition of the journalist and the news organisation, which has not adapted to the age of citizen journalists, tweets, leaks, links and re-posts.
",
4265,1,," we should expand our concept of what makes a “journalist” – and thus, who can take shelter under the umbrella of “media”.
",
4266,1,," we may need to interrogate the lines between “speaker’, “disseminator”, “source” and “reporter” of knowledge.
",
4267,1,,"otherwise, we risk obstructing the new media’s use of government sources.
",
4268,1,," and we risk applying the law in a lopsided fashion.
",
4269,1,," consider this: if we agree to prosecute assange – for endangering national security by leaking confidential government information – should we not also prosecute the editors of the new york times, der spiegel and the other traditional news outlets that re-published wikileaks material?
",
4270,1,,"on the other hand, we could draw the very valid conclusion that these flagship newspapers are already bound by editorial guidelines, ethics standards and professional journalism practices: like verification, fact-checking, placing in context, and anonymising names of those in danger.
",
4271,1,," in other words, these newspapers act professionally – and it is that which earns them the kinds of protection extended to other professional groups, such as lawyers and doctors.
",
4272,1,," if wikileaks does not act in accordance with journalistic standards, should it be able to seek refuge under journalistic privileges?
",
4273,0,,"- katie engelhartfew industries have been changed more radically by the advent of the internet than journalism .
",
4274,0,," the traditional role of the journalist , disseminating information to which they had special or privileged access , has changed beyond recognition .
",
4275,0,," now readers and viewers have direct access to much of that information and can access it at their own convenience and through their own choice of media .
",
4276,0,," sales of newspapers are in freefall and the stranglehold of a handful of broadcasters on political access has been lost forever .
",
4277,0,," there are still extraordinary journalists finding news and genuinely affecting the society around them .
",
4278,0,," for the most part , however , journalists increasingly comment on the news rather than directly collecting it .
",
4279,0,," in many ways , assange has taken journalism back to basics -- acquiring information to which most people do not have access and making it public .
",
4280,0,," the very fact that the powerful and the privileged dislike what he is doing so much could even be taken to suggest that he has to be doing something right as one of the roles of the fourth estate is to act as a check on government .
",
4281,0,," at a time when much of the traditional media seems to have lost its sense of what its role is , wikileaks is providing a timely reminder .
",
4282,0,," we know that most governments struggle with the idea of not having control over information and are suspicious of the media .
",
4283,0,," in a pre-internet age working with a handful of proprietors made controlling information far easier .
",
4284,0,," since the creation of the internet , the idea of controlling the media has become harder , now there are those who can broadcast themselves directly ; a mass of information and opinion that does n't rely on the patronage of publishers or political favour .
",
4285,0,," assange has simply taken a journalistic position that makes sense for the new media age .
",
4286,0,," in contrast to the opinion driven mainstream press and much of the blogosphere , wikileaks actually breaks new stories .
",
4287,0,," new media requires new skills and attitudes of its journalists because the relationship with their readers has changed dramatically but the core of the role , speaking truth to power , remains the same .
",
4288,0,," furthermore they do so in such a way as allows them to publish their source material and allow the reader themselves to make a judgement as to whether their story really reflects that material .
",
4289,0,," this ability , reflecting effectively limitless capacity for providing textual information , meets the frequently heard desire for news without spin -- routinely featured in research into people 's views on the press .
",
4290,0,," this may be a new approach , just as assange is a new type of journalist but he is still a journalist .
",
4291,0,," one of the things that the leveson inquiry has made all too apparent is that simply working for a newspaper or broadcaster is not a satisfactory definition of journalist .
",
4292,0,," in terms of maintaining a professional ethic , the difference between those who hacked into phones -- including that of murdered schoolgirl millie dowler -- and the journalists who broke the story , nick davies and amelia hill could not be starker .
",
4293,0,," equally many popular blogs that focus exclusively on opinion or areas of news far more specialist than has traditionally been considered the role of the daily media .
",
4294,0,," a more useful definition , it would seem , relates more to the ethics and aims of the individual or organisation involved .
",
4295,0,," this has the advantage of ruling out those organisations devoted to advertising , such as listings magazines or shopping channels , or those focused purely on entertainment .
",
4296,0,," a journalist should therefore have a commitment to revealing and disseminating information that is held by those with power to those over whom they wield that power .
",
4297,0,," this means that the journalist gains access to information through various sources and then publicises that information as a story .
",
4298,0,," anonymous sources such as those used by assange are a key part of journalism with many of the biggest stories such as watergate only being published because of anonymity .
",
4299,0,," by such a definition , assange would clearly qualify .
",
4300,0,," this was clearly felt to be the case by the new york times , the guardian , le monde and others who reprinted his original material and drew conclusions from it .
",
4301,0,," it would come as something of a surprise to such publications to discover they were not staffed by journalists .
",
4302,1,,"the drive to control all references to the olympic games is part of a global creep of intellectual property law that has led to a ""right of association"", writes teresa scassa.
",
4303,1,,"it is not surprising that the uk laws are among the most sweeping seen thus far; there is a general trend towards broader and more extensive anti-ambush marketing legislation from one olympic event to the next.
",
4304,1,," it is worth noting that when the law was debated in parliament, the minister for sport expressly admitted that the “right of association” was drafted in the broadest possible terms because there was no consensus as to what type of conduct it was meant to catch and because the future demands of the ioc for a legal response might change.
",
4305,1,,"major event organisers will insist that anti-ambush marketing laws are necessary to ensure fiscal success.
",
4306,1,," complex events such as the olympics have elaborate sponsorship regimes ranging from top sponsors to a web of official suppliers of particular wares or services.
",
4307,1,," top sponsors pay millions of dollars for sponsorship rights, and organisers maintain that these revenues are essential to properly fund the event.
",
4308,1,," the sponsor who pays such substantial sums of money wants a guarantee that the exclusivity they have paid for is respected; they do not want their competitors to be able to leverage the public excitement or interest around the event for their own purposes and without paying for the right to do so.
",
4309,1,,"“ambush marketing” is a term developed in business circles to describe a range of opportunistic marketing practices that have long been a major irritant for event sponsors.
",
4310,1,," an ambush marketer runs an advertising campaign that creates an association between their product and the major event.
",
4311,1,," it is not necessary for the advertiser to create confusion as to their status as a sponsor; it is the mental association the consumer makes with an event that is considered problematic.
",
4312,1,," for example, when visa was the sponsor of the barcelona olympics, a rival credit card company launched a series of ads that exhorted consumers to remember “that you don’t need a visa to visit spain”.
",
4313,1,," ambush marketing has been difficult to stop using traditional ip laws because ambushers are careful not to use the trademarks of either their rivals or the event itself.
",
4314,1,," although some argue that there is an unfair competition dimension to such activities, the actual harm is elusive.
",
4315,1,," it is not clear that consumers are confused about who is a sponsor and who is not; nor is it clear that consumers make choices based on sponsorship status.
",
4316,1,," it is also difficult to establish that the value of sponsorships is tied to the existence of this kind of legislative protection.
",
4317,1,," by contrast, research suggests that the value of a sponsorship is more closely tied to the sponsor’s own efforts to leverage the association for which they have paid through effective advertising campaigns.
",
4318,1,,"yet in spite of the existence of anti-ambush marketing laws, ambush marketing by the major competitors of event sponsors remains common.
",
4319,1,," major corporations have easy access to legal departments that can find the loopholes to effectively exploit in advertising campaigns.
",
4320,1,," for example, in the case of the vancouverwinter olympics, competitors of major sponsors determined that the legislation against ambush marketing did not limit displays of national pride.
",
4321,1,," they launched high profile advertising campaigns that played on this theme (go canada!)
",
4322,1,," to get their piece of the olympic spotlight.
",
4323,1,," while major corporations will find ways around legislation, it is the small and local businesses that are most directly affected.
",
4324,1,," the local restaurant that offers gold, silver or bronze breakfast specials during the olympics will be among those least able to fight the cease and desist letter they will inevitably receive.
",
4325,1,,"by creating property-like rights in major events, governments have further shrunk the already embattled public domain and have contributed once again to the creeping propertisation of just about anything.
",
4326,1,," major events are multi-stakeholder public spectacles.
",
4327,1,," there is something fundamentally important about the ability of these stakeholders – governments, community members, local businesses, taxpayers, citizens, athletes and amateur sporting organisations – to make reference to a public event that involves and impacts them in various ways.
",
4328,0,," by aiming to control event-related narratives in public and commercial spaces, ambush marketing legislation places a chill upon expression that extends far beyond what is genuinely needed to protect the value of sponsorships.
",
4329,0,,"nobody would challenge the right of sponsors to proudly promote their bought association with an event they are sponsoring and to use all of the means at their disposal to declare that association to the world , which they have done .
",
4330,0,," however , there is a world of difference between the positive right to proclaim a particular association and the negative right to prevent anyone else from proclaiming theirs .
",
4331,0,," of course sponsorship should provide bragging rights and privileged access but that is a world away from buying the silence of others .
",
4332,0,," smaller businesses and other organisations see their freedom of expression worst hit by laws that prevent them from associating themselves in any way with major events , to the detriment of their communities .
",
4333,0,," free speech is not relative or conditional and certainly should not be determined on the basis of the thickness of someone 's chequebook .
",
4334,0,," in this regard , freedom of information is a very real issue .
",
4335,0,," those organisations without access to huge legal departments are hardest hit , further disadvantaging them against corporations who can already outspend them on advertising .
",
4336,0,," free speech means that in the world of words and ideas , at least , there is an even playing field and undermining that runs against a sense of natural justice .
",
4337,0,," sponsors are simply using this to increase an already fairly unfair advantage ; many people supported britain 's bid for the games on the basis that it would offer great benefits to local businesses , legislation restricting their ability to use their geographical and cultural association with the event make that pledge look extremely hollow .
",
4338,0,," the major sponsors already went into this situation with massive advantages over small traders who had the sole advantage of the geographical proximity to the events .
",
4339,0,," the idea that , for example , coca cola can prevent street vendors in the olympic village from selling pepsi is absurd .
",
4340,0,," coke is n't planning to make their money back on direct sales of their product around venues but on the prestige it brings them as a global brand .
",
4341,0,," the idea that corporations can , effectively , buy words and phrases set a pernicious precedent similar to their ability to own genes .
",
4342,0,," there are certain things that , self-evidently , are the property of the people .
",
4343,0,," they are held in common and in trust for future generations .
",
4344,0,," they can not be sold because they are not owned .
",
4345,0,," attempts to evade that reality have , generally , been seen as pernicious by history -- even where they have not been rectified .
",
4346,0,," european settlers laying claim to land used by indigenous people would be one example .
",
4347,0,," who can reasonably be said to own , for example , the phrase `` london'' ?
",
4348,0,," if anybody could make such a claim , londoners living in the city inwould seem to be the obvious answer .
",
4349,0,," however , there is a far more satisfying answer that nobody does .
",
4350,0,," the fact that this is happening in relation to the olympics makes the precedent particularly troubling as the idea that the games are for all mankind is at the heart of the olympic ideal .
",
4351,0,," it is an aspiration of our common humanity and all that entails .
",
4352,0,," if chunks of that are for sale then it raises very real concerns about what else could go under the hammer .
",
4353,0,,"- dominic burbidgethere may be more militant forms of religious profession that would be inappropriate in a workplace but wearing a simple piece of jewellery causes no harm or offence to others .
",
4354,0,," as with the demonstration of any right , the fact that its exercise may not be convenient does not supersede its validity .
",
4355,0,," indeed the only way of demonstrating that a society is , in fact , a tolerant one is , by definition , when it tolerates the exercise of legitimate practices which are inconvenient .
",
4356,0,," christianity is an established part of the state , as shown by the monarch being head of the church of england .
",
4357,0,," so it is perverse for two national brands to accept attire that demonstrates an employee 's profession of other faiths but to reject one that is universally recognised as a symbol of christianity .
",
4358,0,," either legislation should respect that commitment in all faiths or it should not do so in any .
",
4359,0,," people of faith attest that those beliefs determine the nature of their own identity and their place in the universe .
",
4360,0,," in the case of nadia eweida , at least , the employer 's case was based on the idea that wearing a symbol of that faith might not enhance their uniform .
",
4361,0,," the difference between the significance of the claims could not be greater .
",
4362,0,," recognising rights when there is no inconvenience to anybody involved is verging on the irrelevant .
",
4363,0,," this is , perhaps , especially true , with freedom of expression .
",
4364,0,," if i recognise your right to express yourself freely - so long as i never have to see , hear or be aware of you doing -- rather misses the point .
",
4365,0,," likewise if the individual is free only so long as there are n't any rules saying they should n't be , goes somewhat against the grain of defending liberties .
",
4366,0,," indeed the history of the idea that people can exercise all the freedom they like as long as it 's out of sight , out of mind and does n't break any rules is not a noble one ; among other absurd forms of `` freedom '' , it was used to justify both segregation and apartheid .
",
4367,0,," although the effect and extent of the prejudice is clearly different here , the logic is the same : you are completely free to do whatever i think you should do .
",
4368,0,," the uk considers itself to be a tolerant country .
",
4369,0,," tolerance means accepting those declarations and statements that are inconvenient .
",
4370,0,," if the law is incapable of defending a statement as benign as wearing a small piece of jewellery , it is worrying to think how it would cope with something more forthright .
",
4371,1,,"the value derived from protecting the defamed overrides the interest of unconstrained editorial freedom.
",
4372,1,," democratic governments can provide parallel guarantees of freedom of the press while protecting individuals against press-related dangers to their human dignity.
",
4373,1,," being able to respond in one’s own words to reputational slurs should be one of the available options in other countries and contexts too.
",
4374,1,,"- maximilian ruhenstroth-bauerdebaters’ notethere is an obvious irony in debating the issue of whether both sides deserve to be heard.
",
4375,1,," that irony is ignored here and, in all likelihood, should make for nothing more than a joke or comment by one of the speakers.
",
4376,1,," as a policy, the issue is clearly debatable and protracted deliberations on whether a case is self-disproving because of the format used tend to be both futile and tedious.
",
4377,1,," it is however, worth noting that, in this instance, it is facts rather than opinions that can be challenged – and that goes to the heart of this debate.
",
4378,0,," the issue of what constitutes a fact – where evidence ends and comment begins – runs to the heart of this debate in particular and the philosophy of debate in general.
",
4379,0,,"it 's a grownup approach to publishing , it acknowledges that newspapers do n't get everything right and embraces the idea that the goal is to convey accurate information -- admittedly belatedly .
",
4380,0,," it 's inevitable that mistakes will be made in a world where newspapers are endlessly running up against deadlines and it is only possible to check so much as a result .
",
4381,0,," in many countries corrections or clarifications in newspapers are buried away in the depths of the middle pages and are unlikely to be spotted by anyone other than the most ardent reader .
",
4382,0,," not only does this defy natural justice but having the correction prominent hits a newspaper for making mistakes as it loses space for a story that would attract both readers and advertisers .
",
4383,0,," where mistakes are made and repeated from wire services or promoted as gospel in local -- often poorly resourced -- newspapers , the impact on someone 's reputation can be considerable .
",
4384,0,," it 's only fair that their megaphone correcting it should be just as large as that used in the first place .
",
4385,1,,"the proposal met with support from some celebrity magazine editors present at the hearing.
",
4386,1,," however, the idea was not received favourably by all.
",
4387,1,," the editor of celebrity magazine ok!
",
4388,1,,", lisa byrne, told the inquiry that the system would not work if all celebrities participated in it.
",
4389,1,," the editor of heat magazine, lucie cave, pointed out that such a register would help celebrities present themselves in way at odds with their private conduct, and that it was indeed in the public interest that such double standards are exposed.
",
4390,1,," speaking on the bbc, the chief executive officer of pr company outside argued that the register would be “unworkable and impractical” and could harm magazines.
",
4391,1,,"a privacy register is a bad idea for two reasons.
",
4392,1,," first of all, it just won’t work.
",
4393,1,," like super-injunctions, the privacy register would not stop internet users from reporting and finding out about those who wish to remain private.
",
4394,1,," moreover, if it did work, such a register would be a bad thing.
",
4395,1,," lucie cave is right: nobody has a right to commercialise their public image and have it protected by the state if it is totally at odds with their private behaviour.
",
4396,1,," if i make money and take to the limelight claiming to have a quality that i demonstrably don’t have, then i’m lying.
",
4397,1,," and responsible media have not only the right but an obligation to expose such lies.
",
4398,1,," it is in the public interest that they do.
",
4399,1,," i would hope that lord leveson’s remark was off-hand.
",
4400,1,," if he meant what he said, he’s not only about to recommend a bad policy – he’s also shown that he does not understand how the media works, and should work, in the 21st century.
",
4401,1,,"- sebastian huempfern.
",
4402,0,,"b. this will be subject to change once lord leveson publishes his report.
",
4403,0,,"the people who are having their private lives splayed over the tabloids and gossip magazines are not politicians or judges taking bribes , they are not police officers beating up suspects , they are not teachers offering grades in exchange for sexual favours or any other area of sensible journalistic investigation .
",
4404,0,," they are people who happen to work in the entertainment industries and their lives are being interrupted for the sake of prurience and curiosity that has nothing to do with a meaningful news agenda .
",
4405,0,," if , as some of those mentioned in the introduction suggest , the worst that happens as a result of such a register is that celebrity magazines vanish , then the proposition is quite relaxed about that .
",
4406,0,," so what if celebrities have double-standards ?
",
4407,0,," so do most people , none of who would appreciate that fact being pointed out on the front pages of the media .
",
4408,0,," a paparazzo 's shot of a second or third rate celeb doing something stupid , or something perfectly sensible but just not in makeup -- or clothes -- makes for an easy page lead .
",
4409,0,," anything that makes editors pause and consider whether they have something that might actually pass for news might do a great deal to pull large chunks of the british media -- along with the readers they claim to serve -- out of the gutter .
",
4410,0,," in recent decades anything with ` celebrity ' associations has been considered news as a sought of kneejerk reaction by editors .
",
4411,0,," even in the ` quality ' press there 's still plenty of coverage of vacuous , self-absorbed , talentless individuals who are famous , mostly , for being famous .
",
4412,0,," nobody is suggesting that this will transform the media overnight but readers moving away from publications that focussed exclusively on celebrity gossip to publications that , while containing some , also have much more news and analysis of real world events and issues certainly could n't hurt levels of social and political engagement .
",
4413,0,," the best way to encourage engagement is through education , which the media can provide .
",
4414,1,,"if depriving the visually-impaired of access to braille makes them less literate – and thus, conceivably, less expressive – can this dispute over library funding be cast as a free speech issue?
",
4415,1,,"free speech debate’s first principle states:we – all human beings – must be free and able to express ourselves, and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas, regardless of frontiers.
",
4416,1,," (emphasis mine.)
",
4417,1,,"we have, admittedly, not given adequate thought to this particular addendum: “and able”.
",
4418,1,," in many of our case studies, we use the “frontiers” to signify national or digital boundaries.
",
4419,1,," in the case of braille, “able” can be defined narrowly – and the “frontiers” of access are decidedly physical.
",
4420,1,,"broadly speaking, access to braille education is a free speech issue.
",
4421,1,," many who use braille insist that the reading code is integral to their literacy and, by extension, their expressiveness.
",
4422,1,," canada has a responsibility to provide its visually-impaired citizens with the particular resources they need to communicate effectively.
",
4423,1,,"on the other hand, critics may ask: won’t audio books do?
",
4424,1,," this is where the issue gets complicated – and not just for the visually-impaired.
",
4425,1,," technology has increased the ways in which we can receive and impart information.
",
4426,1,," each individual is apt to find some methods more useful than others.
",
4427,1,," this begs the question: to preserve free expression, must we safeguard each of these communication means?
",
4428,1,," might cutting of funding for traditional book-sharing facilities, for instance, be considered a strike against those who are not digitally-savvy?
",
4429,1,,"a consideration of this word “able” is particularly pressing as it pertains to those with disabilities.
",
4430,1,," in this case, the issue of “able” thrusts arguments about educational pedagogy into the more politicised realm of “free speech.”
",
4431,0,,"- katie engelhartwe know from the work of educational psychologists that different people acquire knowledge in different ways .
",
4432,0,," for example , some sighted language learners learn more effectively visually , other aurally .
",
4433,0,," the evidence mentioned in the introduction suggests that this is no less true for blind students with those without access to braille scoring less well in exams than those with it .
",
4434,0,," however , even if this were just a matter of preference , it would be odd not to treat this as a free speech issue ; allowing people access to information in a way that is not only possible but comfortable and convenient is at the heart of most forms of information distribution .
",
4435,0,," a majority of people receive their news online but newspapers still exist because some people prefer them .
",
4436,0,," it would be possible for readers to access information via microfiche but would be so inconvenient that it is rarely used .
",
4437,0,," it surely makes sense to see new delivery systems for information as an opportunity to expand , not reduce , the methods available for both imparting and receiving information .
",
4438,0,," whatever the reason for this enduring success , it has it and the latest set of doomsayers may well go the way of the rest .
",
4439,0,," perhaps the greatest reason for its enduring success is that the book is silent .
",
4440,0,," the reader gives voice to characters and charts their own way through fiction or selects their own phrases for emphasis in non-fiction .
",
4441,0,," there is nobody -- actor or director -- between the reader and the author .
",
4442,1,,"having said this, i can understand that someone who has suffered because of the kind of hatred and bigotry that mein kampf espouses would not want to be confronted with any excerpts from the text, and might find the laughter of other people tasteless and even hurtful.
",
4443,1,," it really is problematic when people laugh about the absurdity of racist and anti-semitic propaganda and conveniently forget that both racism and anti-semitism still exist in their own society as they do in germany, austria and switzerland.
",
4444,1,,"on balance, however, i think that the benefits of this kind of intelligent comedy outweigh its harmful side-effects.
",
4445,1,," its contribution to public debate and historical memory as well as the more abstract good of free artistic expression, in this case at least, outweigh the offence that may be caused by the show.
",
4446,1,," this is especially true because everyone can freely choose whether they want to attend somuncu’s shows or not.
",
4447,0,,"sebastian huempferdebaters’ notethere is no doubt that the book also has an iconic significance but that might also be said of das kapital and , more explicitly , the works of lenin and mao but they remain in print for both scholarly and popular consumption .
",
4448,0,," it seems sensible to treat mein kampf as just another book .
",
4449,0,," if this were a recently discovered autobiography by another significant historical figure , it would almost certainly be published - even if it was n't very good .
",
4450,0,," as long as mein kampf remained unavailable it acquired the inevitable allure of the unattainable .
",
4451,0,," the book could be presented as having a status far beyond what it is -- the ill thought-out and self-indulgent ramblings of a bad writer .
",
4452,0,," the issue is not access to the text ; it 's not even really about ownership of the book -- both of which are already possible -- but rather about how the book is treated .
",
4453,0,," not publishing or using the book up until now has simply maintained a situation that was put in place after wwii , which in some ways served a purpose , of saying there was no particular reason for a change at any particular time during that process .
",
4454,0,," however , as the seventieth anniversary of the end of the war comes into view , it seems reasonable that the book should be treated as exactly what it is ; an interesting historical artefact , to be examined as one might any other .
",
4455,1,,"a textbook entitled new history textbook (atarashii rekishi kyokasho) was published by a committee consisting of conservative scholars in 2000, and was approved as a social science textbook for junior high schools by the ministry of education in 2001.
",
4456,1,," this caused controversy and heated debates both domestically and internationally especially in relation to neighbouring countries, such as china and korea, affecting japanese diplomatic relations with them.
",
4457,1,," official approval of the textbook was seen as controversial, as it underplayed japan’s war-time aggression during the sino-japanese war and the second world war.
",
4458,1,," in practice however, the new history textbook was adopted by only a few schools in japan.
",
4459,1,,"in our japanese junior high school textbook in the 1990s comfort women did exist and japanese imperialism was an act of aggression.
",
4460,1,," what is presented by the textbook is far removed from our understanding of japan’s national history but others can contest its veracity much better than we can here.
",
4461,1,,"instead we want to think about how politics is always implicated in the writing or, in this particular instance, rewriting and not writing of the past.
",
4462,1,," it is not a trivial fact that the publication of the textbook was preceded by a period of instability, during which the long-incumbent liberal democratic party lost control over some of its right-wing members.
",
4463,1,," at the same time, the textbook was adopted by a very small minority of local school boards, not least, because a large enough number of concerned citizens spoke out against its use.
",
4464,1,," in that sense, a plurality of voices as well as the means to express those voices were present in japan, as they should be in a country with institutions that enable free speech.
",
4465,1,,"in response to this heated controversy, in 2002, japan, china and south korea formed a joint research committee on the content of history textbooks.
",
4466,1,," this committee was expected to be a forum for the three countries to exchange their views on history and the textbook.
",
4467,1,," controversy abated thereafter.
",
4468,1,," the committee continues its activities today and it has published several reference books of history drawn from discussions among experts and incorporating views from each country.
",
4469,1,," however, there are inherent obstacles in accurately reflecting voices from abroad in texts produced as a part of a school curriculum that is one of the sites for the diffusion of national historical narratives, all the more so when these conflict with the narratives of their neighbours.
",
4470,1,,"ultimately this controversy begs a fundamental question that goes to the heart of the nature of liberal democracy and the nation-state.
",
4471,1,," should a state be accountable to the voices of people beyond its national borders?
",
4472,0,,"- ayako komine and naoko hosokawathe japanese government is not forcing schools to teach japanese history in a way that whitewashes the japanese record in world war ii .
",
4473,0,," in japan the ministry of education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available .
",
4474,0,," schools are then allowed to select their textbook from a list of seven or eight textbooks that have been approved both by the ministry .
",
4475,0,," by making this choice schools are exercising their freedom of speech in deciding what should be taught in their classrooms .
",
4476,0,," in the case of the new history textbook , atarashii rekishi kyokasho , not a single state run junior high school adopted the textbook resulting in a mere 0.03 % of junior high school students using the textbook .
",
4477,0,," by contrast china 's textbooks and their misrepresentations are mandatory .
",
4478,0,," this shows that when the japanese people are given freedom of information on the issue they exercise this right responsibly .
",
4479,0,," to state the obvious there is an immense amount of history .
",
4480,0,," there is much more history than could ever be taught in school .
",
4481,0,," this means there needs to be some way to cut down everything in history into a sensible sized syllabus .
",
4482,0,," there are some obvious ways to cut down history to a manageable length ; such as concentrating on the history of the nation , focusing on certain key events , focusing on things of particular importance to today , or sometimes just on things that are considered fun and interesting .
",
4483,0,," in the uk there have been accusations , including by the current education secretary michael gove , that british history is neglected in favour of nazi germany and the american west -- something that then avoids britain 's less than comfortable imperial past .
",
4484,0,," it should therefore come as no surprise that japan does not highlight world war ii and in particular the bad parts of that conflict .
",
4485,0,," does china teach about its invasion of tibet ?
",
4486,0,," history is not about learning all history , it is not about learning particular bits of history , it is not even necessarily about learning a nations ' story , rather it is about encouraging students to think critically .
",
4487,0,," it has been regularly shown that stuffing children with facts turns them off a subject instead there should be interaction , discussion , analysing texts from the time and analysing bias .
",
4488,0,," the space in the textbook devoted to the issues is very limited and therefore what they mention does not matter particularly much .
",
4489,0,," what matters therefore is how the teachers teach the issues as they will have to supplement the textbooks with other works and there is a wide range to choose from .
",
4490,0,," what matters then is how the teachers expand on the issues within the textbook rather than the textbook itself -- the textbook could even be useful at studying the subject by providing a source to study bias on wwii .
",
4491,0,," to some the idea of a national story may be an anachronism but history is one of the things that bind a country together .
",
4492,0,," as benedict anderson argues nations are ` imagined communities ' as members of that nation will never know most of the members of that community or even hear about them but despite this there is conceived to be a comradeship between its members .
",
4493,0,," the creation of a national story from the history of the nation that helps create that common unit .
",
4494,0,," french historian ernest renan went so far as to argue that ` getting its history wrong is part of being a nation ' .
",
4495,0,," south korean president lee myung-bak himself has argued `` a textbook of modern history should be written in a way that does not hurt our national pride , '' when criticising a south korean textbook 's interpretation of the dividing of korea .
",
4496,0,," if this is the case it is difficult to see how there can be any objection to japan using the same principle .
",
4497,1,,"in october 2001, an evangelical christian preacher called harry hammond started preaching in a square in bournemouth, england.
",
4498,1,," he held up a placard saying, “stop immorality, stop homosexuality, stop lesbianism.”
",
4499,1,," the words “jesus is lord” were inscribed on each corner.
",
4500,1,," an angry crowd gathered around him, arguing, shouting and even throwing soil at him.
",
4501,1,," at one point, someone tried to pull away his placard, causing him to fall backwards.
",
4502,1,,"“this conviction was quite wrong.
",
4503,1,," hammond was expressing his beliefs.
",
4504,1,," these are offensive to many of us, but in a free and diverse society, no one has a right not to be offended.
",
4505,1,," he was not inciting violence.
",
4506,1,," the policeman should have warned and if need be arrested the person using force to pull the placard away from the preacher – not the preacher himself.
",
4507,1,," by tackling the wrong man the police officer was encouraging what in the us is called “the heckler’s veto”.
",
4508,1,," shout loudly enough, with menace, and you can close down legitimate debate.
",
4509,1,," this is a textbook example of how the law should not be used.”
",
4510,0,,"- timothy garton ash views on issues such as abortion , women , and what constitutes an acceptable family expressed by those who are extremely religious are simply bigoted views which are given credibility by being wrapped in a cassock .
",
4511,0,," it is in the nature of religious belief that any set of views can adopt a religious justification and there is no objective measure against which to hold the views .
",
4512,0,," for example the homophobic views which have common currency in many churches can be contrasted with a gay liberation trend discernible in others .
",
4513,0,," in the light of this , it makes sense to judge the views on their own basis , regardless of the religiosity surrounding them .
",
4514,0,," the views expressed by harry hammond , and others , need to be stripped of their religious veneer and shown that at their heart they are simply offensive .
",
4515,0,," there is absolutely no reason why lgbt people should have to endure vitriol and condemnation as they go about their daily lives .
",
4516,0,," it is a useful exercise to consider how we would respond to a secular speaker saying that the actions of two people who were in love with each other should condemn them to torment and suffering .
",
4517,0,," oddly however , the moment this is done in the name of god , it somehow becomes acceptable .
",
4518,0,," free speech must come second when there is the potential for that speech to cause harm .
",
4519,0,," the mantra of `` with god on our side '' has been used , and continues to be used , to justify massacre and barbarity throughout history .
",
4520,0,," although it is rarely the prelates and preachers who do the killing the certainty they promote gives surety to those who do .
",
4521,0,," the purpose of the act used in this particular case was an entirely practical one .
",
4522,0,," it 's main role was to tidy up existing legislation on rioting and public disorder but one section recognised that homophobic and racist language do lead to violence .
",
4523,0,," it is all well and good to talk of freedom of speech but the reality is that homophobic speeches , particularly those of a religious nature , may well lead to violence .
",
4524,0,," for example in new york there were a series of homophobic attacks after anti-gay statements by republican politicians .
",
4525,0,," preventing hate speech helps prevent that violence from occurring so justifying restrictions on freedom of speech .
",
4526,0,," homophobia is the last respectable prejudice and should be tackled with the same passion and force that others have been , and continue to be , confronted .
",
4527,0,," if the speaker had been condemning black people or women they would have been arrested for public disorder if they represented an organisation that was overtly racist , it would be quite likely to be banned .
",
4528,0,," for some reason churches that hold views on homosexuality that are comparable in their vitriol to those on race held by neo-nazi groups are not only tolerated but frequently supported by the state .
",
4529,0,," hatred is hatred and there is no reason why homophobia should be given a free pass that would not be given to racism or sexism .
",
4530,0,," all of the abrahamic faiths have , at their core , an authority focussed on maintaining ` the natural order ' .
",
4531,0,," from the fourteenth century on -- although interestingly less so before that point -- homosexuality has been singled out as one of the gravest of sins , with the catechism identifying it as one of four sins that `` calls out to heaven for vengeance '' .
",
4532,0,," that is not merely offensive but dangerous in a modern society .
",
4533,1,,"conspiracy to murder americans overseas was not the only crime of which mehanna was convicted.
",
4534,1,," additionally, the court found him guilty of a further crime: conspiring to “provide material support” to terrorists.
",
4535,1,," when mehanna returned from his unsuccessful trip to yemen, he launched a website on which he provided english translation of “pro-jihad” documents.
",
4536,1,," one such document,ways to serve and participate in jihad, explains the various paths muslims can take to defend their fellow muslims, from participating in wars against foreign aggressors to taking care of widows and children.
",
4537,0,,"- jeff howardnobody is suggesting that mehanna planted a bomb -- or even attempted to .
",
4538,0,," his crime , if it deserves such a word is to hold an opinion and to have expressed it .
",
4539,0,," that opinion was that current american military policy in the muslim world is wrong and to suggest that those living there should be opposition to the major powers of the age attempting to impose their will , through force of arms , on a people in a different country .
",
4540,0,," tarek mehanna did not justify , take part in , orchestrate , fund , supply , encourage or plan an attack on us personnel .
",
4541,0,," there is no case to answer .
",
4542,0,," mainstream politicians have called for an immediate withdrawal of american troops and the claims emanating from the right of the republican party that doing so ` gives succour to america 's enemies ' now sounds as shrill as they do bizarre .
",
4543,0,," yet none of them are in prison .
",
4544,0,," ministers of god , political activists and intellectuals have raised the issue of the loss of life among civilians in the muslim world and the questionable justification of those losses on the grounds of national security .
",
4545,0,," and yet they remain at liberty .
",
4546,0,," america 's allies around the world have questioned the continued presence of us troops in the region and , in many cases , withdrawn their own - and -- if removing troops from the fight is not aiding the enemy , it would be difficult to imagine what might be .
",
4547,0,," despite this , leaders of these nations are honoured guests when they visit the whitehouse .
",
4548,0,,"national security concerns around terrorism mean that it is necessary to have a deterrent that will help prevent the recruitment of terrorists .
",
4549,0,," terrorism is one of the biggest threats to western countries today and this is potentially an effective way of dealing with it .
",
4550,0,," traditional military responses to terrorism do not work due to terrorists ' underground nature and decentralised cell structure that operates throughout the world .
",
4551,0,," it is even questionable whether ` al qaeda ' as a group exists at all except as an identity for those wanting to attack the west to operate under .
",
4552,0,," efforts against terrorism therefore need to be aimed at preventing radicalisation and stopping individuals rather than attempting to destroy the whole group known as al qaeda .
",
4553,0,," this law not only deters people from becoming extremists through making them think twice about visiting extremist websites but it also helps to deter promoters of extremism through denying them an audience .
",
4554,0,," if punishing users of extremist websites prevents even a few people who would otherwise have visited these websites from doing so and setting out on a part of radicalisation that leads to terrorism then it will have been a success .
",
4555,0,," the internet may be a free for all where all ideas and viewpoints can be found but that does not mean that all users view all these views .
",
4556,0,," instead the internet acts as an echo chamber that encourages people to believe their own views are correct and so get more extreme rather than challenging them .
",
4557,0,," eli pariser author of a book called the filter bubble argues that the internet forces us to consume a very narrow range of views as search engines have been personalised with the intention of letting users find what they like so two people searching for the same thing on google can get very different results , for example when googling ` bp ' during the oil spill one person might be directed to information about the spill and its environmental consequences while another might get just investment information .
",
4558,0,," when this kind of filtering is added to people constantly interacting with extremists and on websites praise and incite terrorism it is clear that users of these sites will get caught in a confirmation bias and conformation bias tends to lead to people becoming more polarised .
",
4559,0,," it is therefore the right policy to punish users of extremist websites before they become too radicalised as it is only a very short step from believing an attack is praiseworthy to carrying out similar attacks .
",
4560,0,," regardless of whether as sarkozy claims mohammed merah would himself have been stopped earlier had this law been in place at the time this law will catch some terrorists in the future and stop them before they can do large amounts of harm .
",
4561,0,," punishing users of extremist websites will mean that the government can stop those who are on a path to radicalisation through their access to the internet and as a result this will help neutralise a key tool used by extremists to radicalise others .
",
4562,0,," there have already been examples of people being inspired to carry out violent jihad through material online such as roshonara choudhry who after watching some of anwar al awlaki 's sermons online attempted to murder labour mp stephen timms .
",
4563,0,," this kind of legislation would mean that he could be punished for the lesser crime thereby preventing him from being able to engage in much more damaging criminal activities .
",
4564,0,," simply put if extremists are behind bars they are not engaging in terrorist attacks that could kill many people .
",
4565,1,,"was punk band pussy riot’s anti-putin performance in a moscow church 'religious hatred hooliganism' or an artistic form of political dissent?
",
4566,1,," olga shvarova considers the case.
",
4567,1,,"there is another aspect to pussy riot’s case worth mentioning here.
",
4568,1,," the russian orthodox church seemed to endorse the government’s infringement of free speech and severe punishment for the band’s performance, which in effect was a political statement, offensive not to the church but to the head of state.
",
4569,1,," there was a blasphemous phrase in the lyrics of the song concerning god, a vulgar swear word, but one that is commonly used in everyday speech.
",
4570,1,," the church’s attempt to invoke blasphemy in this case looks more like support for the head of state than a response to any actual offence to religion.
",
4571,0,,"- olga shvarovathe very fact that this has become a cause celebre shows the extent to which those who able to step back from the situation recognise this for what it is ; a clear abuse of presidential power given the thinnest sheen of respectability by a compliant church .
",
4572,0,," such religious content as was contained in the protest fairly obviously relates to the setting and is not the main content of the song .
",
4573,0,," it 's a fairly straightforward artistic device .
",
4574,0,," it does , however , raise the question that if the intent of this song was to be blasphemous -- a necessary component of proving it to be so -- then why did they do such a bad job of it and spend so much their time going on about politics ; it would suggest somewhat incompetent activists .
",
4575,1,,"the sophistication of modern surveillance technology has increased by leaps and bounds in the 21st century.
",
4576,1,," governments have unprecedented power to watch their citizens, to see almost every aspect of their private and public lives.
",
4577,1,," by use of cctv, internet censorship and infiltration, wire-taps, and a multitude of other systems, governments have enormous power to control the populace.
",
4578,1,,"undemocratic regimes have become some of the best customers of western surveillance tech companies and governments, using the technology to develop a firmer grip on their citizens who might seek to challenge the state.
",
4579,1,," they have exploited the desire of democracies’ desire for profit and influence in order to make themselves even more unassailable to the forces of dissent.
",
4580,1,," since the start of the civil war in syria there has been criticism that there have been sales of surveillance equipment to bashar al assad’s regime.
",
4581,1,," france for example has investigated a technology company qosmos for a project that involved software that allowed the syrian government to monitor political opponents, often leading to their arrest.
",
4582,1,," human rights groups allege that this is “complicity in torture”, if so executives could face criminal charges.
",
4583,1,,"a debate has emerged regarding the culpability of democracies in the continued oppression of people abroad.
",
4584,1,," some states already limit their sales of surveillance technology to non-democratic regimes, such as canada and to a lesser extent the united states, though no universal bans are prevalent.
",
4585,1,," there have been recent attempts in the us congress to change this by passing a ‘global online freedom act’ which would prevent such sales to ‘internet restricting countries’, inthis failed to pass but has been reintroduced.
",
4586,1,," should democracies refuse to sell technology that could be used for ill to regimes abroad, or does it have more to gain from treating them as equally valid governments?
",
4587,1,," this question forms the core of this debate, and is explored in the following arguments.
",
4588,0,," high-tech surveillance technology has given repressive governments and police states a new lease on life .
",
4589,0,," now more than ever they can intrude into every aspect of people 's lives , ensuring that dissent is cowed for fear of the ever present threat of the security services .
",
4590,0,," the vision of orwell 'shas become a living nightmare for people all over the world .
",
4591,0,," their power has made it extremely difficult for movements for reform , government accountability , and democracy , which have foundered when faced with these sophisticated security apparatuses , valentino-devries  .
",
4592,0,," by dominating the flow of information states have the power to keep their people in check and prevent them from ever posing a threat to their repressive status quo .
",
4593,0,," thus china blocks access to the internet and to other forms of communications in tibet to `` ensure the absolute security of tibet 's ideological and cultural realm '' .
",
4594,0,," it cuts the tibetan people off from outside world so as to prevent any rerun of the instability that occurred in, which china blamed on the influence of the dalai lama from outside .
",
4595,0,," only external help in alleviating this censorship could allow activists to organize effectively and perhaps to one day bring about genuine reform and justice to their societies .
",
4596,0,," the surveillance equipment on which these regimes rely is often only available from firms and governments in the democratic world where , by and large , technology is generally far more advanced than in the non-democratic world .
",
4597,0,," without access to these technologies , the regimes would be far more hard-pressed to keep rigid tabs on their citizens , allowing for the seeds of dissent to take root .
",
4598,0,," only then can the forces clamouring for democracy hope to be able to organise networks of activists , and to have their views considered by the state .
",
4599,0,," it is common for western democracies to make sweeping statements about the universality of certain rights , and that their system of government is the one that should be most sought after in the world , that democracy is the only legitimate form of government .
",
4600,0,," as when obama in cairo proclaimed `` these are not just american ideas ; they are human rights .
",
4601,0,," and that is why we will support them everywhere . ''
",
4602,0,," they claim to work in the united nations and other organizations toward the improvement of rights in other countries and clamour about the need for building governments accountability around the world , using their liberal-democratic paradigm as the model .
",
4603,0,," yet at the same time democratic governments and companies sell technologies to non-democratic allies that are used to systematically abuse the rights of citizens and to entrench the power of those avowedly illegitimate regimes .
",
4604,0,," these hypocrisies read as a litany of shame .
",
4605,0,," a telling example is the blair government in the united kingdom selling weapons to an oppressive regime in indonesia for the sake of political expediency even after proclaiming an ` ethical foreign policy ' .
",
4606,0,," even if democracies do not feel it is a defensible position to actively seek to subvert all non-democratic states , and that non-democracies should be considered semi-legitimate on the basis of nations ' right to self-determination , they should still feel morally obliged not to abet those regimes by providing the very tools of oppression on which they rely .
",
4607,0,," to continue dealing in these technologies serves only to make democratic countries ' statements hollow , and the rights they claim to uphold seem less absolute , a risk in itself to freedoms within democracies .
",
4608,0,," respect for rights begins at home , and actively eroding them elsewhere reduces respect for them by home governments .
",
4609,0,," corporations are private entities that have the right to sell their services and to deal with agents foreign and domestic , including governments .
",
4610,0,," however , this right can be limited when those actions are oppositional to the aims of the home state in which they are incorporated .
",
4611,0,," the sale of surveillance technology to undemocratic regimes stands against the avowed aims of democracies and against their strategic interests in bolstering democracy abroad and maintaining a reputation for fair dealing .
",
4612,0,," for this reason it is perfectly legitimate for governments to ban the corporations within their borders from selling dangerous technologies to foreign governments .
",
4613,0,," such is already the case with many kinds of strategic technology , especially weapons technology .
",
4614,0,," the eu , for example , bans a range of arms sales to various oppressive states on these grounds , china in particular is an example where it would potentially be very lucrative to overturn the ban .
",
4615,0,," corporations benefit from the protection of democratic states , as they provide bases of operations that shield their right to property and ensure stability and the rule of law .
",
4616,0,," if corporations wish to benefit from these provisions they must be willing to accept the instructions of the states that house them regarding what can and can not be sold to foreign powers .
",
4617,0,," a ban on the sale of surveillance technology to non-democracies serves ultimately as a statement of disapproval .
",
4618,0,," it shows that the undemocratic regimes can not be trusted with the ability to spy on their people .
",
4619,0,," this signal has several effects .
",
4620,0,," an example of this international shaming affecting is the international bans on the use of landmines .
",
4621,0,," various states created a framework , the ottawa convention , in which their condemnation pressured nearly every other state , including authoritarian regimes , to follow suit .
",
4622,0,," domestically it serves to bolster people 's faith in the system of rights they value highly and enshrine in law .
",
4623,0,," they can point to this ban as an example of their government 's desire to make a better world and not to increase repression for the sake of power or profit .
",
4624,0,," in the undemocratic states themselves , the regime leaders will be faced with a significant public relations blow as they come under criticism .
",
4625,0,," this serves to embolden and empower holders of dissenting opinions and to spark pro-democratic discourse .
",
4626,0,," in the international community it makes an emphatic value judgement on the merit of certain systems of government , namely the superiority of democracy and government accountability to the people , principles most non-democracies still pay some form of lip-service to .
",
4627,0,," overall , this policy boosts the credibility of democracy , while undermining the influence of undemocratic states .
",
4628,1,,"the amendments passed onmayprevent internet service providers from blocking, hindering, or slowing down applications and services on the internet, save in specific circumstances such as to give effect to a court order or to preserve the integrity and security of the network.
",
4629,1,," in addition to providing for net neutrality, the amendments also restrict the situations in which isps can disconnect or wiretap their users.
",
4630,1,,"free speech debate’s second draft principle states: “we defend the internet and all other forms of communication against illegitimate encroachments by both public and private powers.”
",
4631,1,," the amendments approved by the senate of the netherlands onmay 2012, by limiting the situations in which isps can manage internet traffic, help to preserve an open internet in which individuals can access information and communicate freely.
",
4632,1,," while recognising that in certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for isps to block or slow down applications and services, these amendments signal that in order to protect freedom of speech and information on the internet, such activities should be the exception, and not the rule.
",
4633,1,,"- graham reynoldsdebaters notealthough this is, in reality a prop heavy motion, it’s not quite as cut and dry as the introduction would make it appear.
",
4634,1,," the issue for isps is primarily one of cost – although some proponents of the legislation have suggested that this is little more than price gouging on the part of isps.
",
4635,0,," there is also a more subtle issue of equality and access – that flat rate tariffs mean that light bandwidth users are paying for those using more capacity.
",
4636,0,,"the principle here is that the data being used is simply none of the isps business .
",
4637,0,," their job is simply to provide an agreed bandwidth , at an agreed price to the end user .
",
4638,0,," how the end user makes use of that band width is up to them .
",
4639,0,," if , for example , they 're choosing to skype from a mobile device -- one of the points of contention -- it 's hard to see what that has to do with the isp .
",
4640,0,," this is of concern both to end users and to the producers of content .
",
4641,0,," there are very real concerns here , as a result , about the impact this has on freedom of expression .
",
4642,0,," the best way to avoid censorship -- either commercial or political -- is to ensure that it remains impossible to achieve in the first place .
",
4643,0,," once it becomes possible to give preference to some forms of content or points of origin , then commercial censorship at least becomes a great deal easier .
",
4644,1,,"pakistan’s blasphemy law is problematic on a number of levels.
",
4645,1,," firstly, in its current manifestation, section 295-c of the penal code does not include in its clauses the intention of using derogatory words against the prophet muhammad.
",
4646,1,," thus, from the onset, the onus of proving oneself innocent is placed upon the defendant.
",
4647,1,," this violates one of the most basic principles of any modern justice system i.e. the accused is innocent until proven guilty.
",
4648,1,,"debaters’ noteas with many debates relating to belief, especially religious belief, it is easy for debates related to blasphemy to get sidetracked into an argument as to whether blasphemy is a meaningful term.
",
4649,1,," it’s worth avoiding this route, as we shall see there are jurisprudential issues that apply regardless of the actuality or otherwise of blasphemy.
",
4650,0,," many of these arguments also relate to debates of laws relating to other ‘thought crimes’.
",
4651,0,,"blasphemy , by its nature , is ` all in the eye of the beholder ' .
",
4652,0,," it is impossible , in most cases , to determine whether there was intent on the part of the accused and as a result it is difficult to codify in legislation .
",
4653,0,," equally , unless the law takes a particular theological position , one person 's blasphemous slur is another 's sacred profession .
",
4654,0,," it relies on the predicate that the person alleging blasphemy was offended or felt their faith was under attack .
",
4655,0,," of course these offences are very real and may at times be possible to codify but they can not be applied universally because the perceptions they necessitate are not universal .
",
4656,0,," in the light of this there may be many remedies for blasphemy but legislation in general and criminal sanctions in particular can not be appropriate .
",
4657,0,," in the case of blasphemy , such harm can not be demonstrated .
",
4658,0,," there is also an interesting point of whether god can be said to have been harmed and whether it is possible for a third party , other than the state , to act as a result of harm having been caused to another .
",
4659,0,," as a result , since harm can not be proven and neither , in most cases , as we have seen in the previous argument , can intent be proven , it is difficult to see how blasphemy is anything other than free speech .
",
4660,0,," it is far easier for other social groups -- sexual and political minorities , people of disabilities and others -- to prove both harm and intent of statements and actions but lack the legal protection given to religious organisations through blasphemy laws .
",
4661,1,,"access to information held by public bodies is a crucial component of freedom of expression and warrants a separate principle dedicated to it for several reasons.
",
4662,1,,"first, and most importantly, access to information held by public bodies, as well as by private entities that perform public functions or receive public funds, is essential if people are to be able to participate in informed debate; hold governments accountable; protect human rights, health, public safety, and the environment; and ensure access to public goods and services on an equitable basis.
",
4663,1,,"there are two broad categories of information that people need from the government.
",
4664,1,," we need information as consumers and users of government services, including how to access services and entitlements, and how to evaluate what services – hospitals, schools, means of transportation – are best for us.
",
4665,1,," the public, and especially the watchdogs, also need information about how government agencies are functioning – their budgets, their outputs, their policies, the salaries of officials, contracts for outsourcing, reports of oversight bodies – in order to evaluate whether agencies are providing value for money and complying with international law, and constitutional and statutory requirements.
",
4666,1,,"public agencies are particularly reluctant to make information available that the public could use to hold them, or key officials, accountable.
",
4667,1,," they may also not want to make some consumer information available simply because it’s cumbersome to compile and double-check, or because disclosure of the information could expose wrongdoing or mismanagement by entities that press for secrecy.
",
4668,1,," for instance, the us consumer agency for a long time resisted publishing complaints about products, citing the concern that some complaints might be ill-founded and that publishing the information could unfairly prejudice the manufacturer and/or lead to defamation actions.
",
4669,1,," the agency finally agreed to publish the information in junenoting that they would include a disclaimer.
",
4670,1,,"second, concepts such as the freedom to “receive and impart information and ideas”, mentioned in principledo not encompass the full meaning of  “access to information held by public bodies”.
",
4671,1,," the “freedom to receive and impart information”, set forth in the universal declaration of human rights and subsequent un and regional treaties, has generally been understood to apply only to the freedom of willing entities to exchange information free from government interference, but not to address the claims of citizens and others to get information from public bodies that those bodies don’t want to disclose.
",
4672,1,,"third, international and national experts, institutions and laws have only very recently affirmed that the right to freedom of expression includes a right of access to information held by public bodies.
",
4673,1,," for instance, only indid the un human rights committee declare that articleof the international covenant on civil and political rights embraces a right of access to information held by public bodies.
",
4674,1,," the committee, comprised ofexperts elected by un member states, is the body tasked with authoritatively interpreting and applying the covenant, a treaty that codifies parts of the universal declaration of human rights.
",
4675,1,," given the newness of the international recognition of this right, its importance, and the proclivity of governments to deny an obligation to make information available, a separate principle is warranted.
",
4676,1,,"accordingly, i would add a new principle, worded as follows:“we require information, including from public bodies, in order to be able to participate in informed debate; hold our governments accountable; protect our human rights, public safety, health and the environment; and ensure our access to public goods and services on an equitable basis.”
",
4677,1,,"that principle responds to the points above, and also implicitly makes two additional points.
",
4678,1,," first our need for information includes, but is not limited to, information held by public bodies.
",
4679,1,," the un human rights committee and numerous national laws recognise that people also need information from non-public entities that perform public functions, receive public funds, are substantially government-controlled or are established by law.
",
4680,1,," a few modern laws and constitutions, including south africa’s, recognise that people also may need information from any entity that impairs their rights.
",
4681,1,," second, the need for information held by public bodies is not limited to citizens; rather, it is a human right, which, as freedom of expression, has both an instrumental as well as an essential value.
",
4682,1,," it is as essential to our humanity and freedom to be able to make informed choices as it is to be able to express ourselves.
",
4683,1,," at the instrumental level, residents of a country (whether or not citizens), as well as individuals that are in other ways impacted by a government’s actions, certainly have a need and a right to information held by that government.
",
4684,1,,"finally, i also suggest that principleshould be expanded to expressly refer to freedom of information:“we must be free to challenge all limits to freedom of information and expression justified on such grounds as national security, public order and morality.”
",
4685,1,,"this addition makes clear that people must be allowed not only to express opinions that offend the government of the day, but also to challenge secrecy based on national security and related public interests.
",
4686,0,,"sandra coliverdebaters notenick bibbythe primary advantage of putting the duty on government to publish , rather than on citizens to enquire is that it does not require the citizen to know what they need to know before they know it .
",
4687,0,," publication en masse allows researchers to investigate areas they think are likely to produce results , specialists to follow decisions relevant to their field and , also , raises the possibility of discovering things by chance .
",
4688,0,," the experience of wikipedia suggests that even very large quantities of data are relatively easy to mine as long as all the related documentation is available to the researcher -- the frustration , by contrast , comes when one has only a single datum with no way of contextualising it .
",
4689,0,," any other situation , at the very least , panders to the interests of government to find any available excuse for not publishing anything that it is likely to find embarrassing and , virtually by definition , would be of most interest to the active citizen .
",
4690,0,," genuine transparency and accountability of government action is not only in the interests of those who also have the right to vote for that government or who support it through the payment of taxes .
",
4691,0,," the functioning of immigration services would seem to be a prime example .
",
4692,0,," maximising access to information relating to government decisions by dint of its automatic publication of information relating to those decisions ensures that all those affected will have recourse to the facts behind any decision .
",
4693,0,," required publication , by contrast , presents an even playing field to all parties .
",
4694,0,," rather than allowing legislators to determine how and to whom -- and for what -- they should be accountable , a presumption in favour of publication makes them accountable to all .
",
4695,0,," as a result , it is the only truly effective way of ensuring one of the key aims set out in favour of any freedom of information process .
",
4696,1,,"despite ongoing debates about cause and effect, the protest movements that began in tunisia and spread throughout the arab world have had one clear vehicle: freedom of assembly and expression.
",
4697,1,," the crowds of arab youth that have assembled in cities, towns and villages have forced authoritarian rulers to recognise them, their right to protest the status quo and their right to demand change.
",
4698,1,," while in some countries winning this right has been accomplished relatively easily and quickly, in other countries it has been difficult, dangerous and deadly.
",
4699,1,," yet protesters have continued to demand the right to voice their grievances against the powers that be.
",
4700,1,,"while demands have largely been aired using traditional means like word of mouth, demonstrations, marches and sit-ins and broadcast via satellite television channels, we have also seen an explosion of creative ideas and creative solutions.
",
4701,1,," from the use of colourful graffiti in libya to new and social media in egypt and syria, young arabs have made their voices heard through a variety of new platforms.
",
4702,1,,"yet one tool the majority of arab protesters have not used is radio.
",
4703,1,,"like many other traditional media tools, radio has been declared dead numerous times only to see its revival and novel usage in new settings and contexts.
",
4704,1,," but while the rest of the world, including many semi-closed regimes, has been tolerant of private and community radio, the arab world, including some relatively open societies, has limited radio licences to government organisations or the elite business entities that circulate within their orbit.
",
4705,1,,"there are historic reasons for this anti-radio policy.
",
4706,1,," as radio was experiencing its golden age, the post-colonial arab world witnessed repeated revolutions and coups in which military generals took over national radio stations along with presidential palaces.
",
4707,1,," the first communiqué announcing a new ruler was usually broadcast over radio, and all other government organs quickly fell in line.
",
4708,1,," these military dictators who took power by capturing the radio network would naturally oppose others using it to challenge their power.
",
4709,1,," in the arab world, the buildings that housed radio stations, and later television stations, often became the most heavily guarded pieces of real estate in the country.
",
4710,1,," media outlets were effectively turned into military installations with multiple forms of identification and body searches required for entrance.
",
4711,1,,"the programming broadcast by these stations was also entirely controlled by central governments.
",
4712,1,," a direct telephone line would connect the office of the radio or television director to the palace of the president or king.
",
4713,1,," even with the proliferation of satellite television and the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, radio licences remained limited to rulers’ most loyal and trusted friends.
",
4714,1,," when private licences were granted, station owners were given clear instructions not to deal with politics and news.
",
4715,1,," this system ensured that news coverage was sanitised of anything that might disturb or question the prevailing government narrative.
",
4716,1,," the stark absence of local news ensured that the public’s attention was diverted from pressing social, economic and political issues in their communities.
",
4717,1,,"this control over media sources was so entrenched that even when the arab uprisings managed to unseat ruling powers, little was done to change the prevailing media structures.
",
4718,1,," it became clear that changing rulers was easier than changing the media regulatory framework that had been built up over decades.
",
4719,1,,"the millions of protesters in tahrir square, alexandria and suez who succeeded in creating geographical zones free of security and police control were unable to even think about—let alone work towards—creating an equivalent on local radio stations through which they could propagate their revolutionary vision.
",
4720,1,," transmitter equipment was nowhere to be found and electrical engineers were not called on to create simple transmission systems.
",
4721,1,," decades of government intimidation had clearly had its effect on the psyche of everyday egyptians, tunisians and yemenis, leaving the airwaves uncontested by revolutionary voices.
",
4722,1,,"autocratic arab rulers who enforced national unity by the power of the gun were certainly not interested in media that encouraged and empowered local communities to celebrate their specific ethnicity, language, culture or religion.
",
4723,1,," to deny this basic communication capacity ensures that these populations remain forever ignorant, unable to educate themselves and therefore unable to fight for their rights.
",
4724,1,,"some powers wrongly claim that community-based media will exacerbate tensions between various ethnic and national communities, contribute to the break-up of countries and even spread civil war across the middle east.
",
4725,1,," the fact is that people living in the various countries that make up the arab league are diverse in a multitude of ways.
",
4726,1,," instead of denying this diversity and forcing people of different backgrounds to conform to a single cultural and national identity, a more humane approach would be to allow these diverse flowers to bloom within their national garden.
",
4727,1,," by embracing and empowering these different groups, the arab world’s new rulers will be planting the seeds for stable governing bodies that will better withstand both internal and external threats.
",
4728,1,," community radio would therefore be a saviour for these new regimes rather than an obstacle.communities, especially those outside the main metropolitan capitals of the arab world, have largely been ignored by autocratic powers.
",
4729,1,," now that these totalitarian power structures are being replaced by democratically elected governments, one would hope that new leaders will change their policies towards these communities for the better.
",
4730,1,," allowing community radio to thrive costs governments nothing and produces amazing results in communities, and therefore in nations.
",
4731,0,," creating a welcoming administrative and legal environment for community radio in the arab world should be a “no-brainer”—provided we have leaders that genuinely care about their communities.
",
4732,0,,"the events of the arab spring , and previous events such as the revolutions of, have shown that effective means of communicating are vital .
",
4733,0,," in a country where people have heard only one perspective , anything that can break the monopoly is to be welcomed .
",
4734,0,," as orwell put it , ` in an age of universal deceit , to tell the truth is a subversive act ' .
",
4735,0,," community radio can both encourage an initial outpouring of democracy and , just as importantly , ensure that a diversity of opinions means that one autocratic regime is not just replaced by another .
",
4736,0,," community radio relies on the power of its ideas and the thirst for those ideas among its audience .
",
4737,0,," it accepts the notion that it is the exchange of information and views , freely given and received , that is more important than the ideas themselves .
",
4738,0,," it does n't require massive budgets and radio waves can be received on equipment that costs pennies ; more importantly it can be shared .
",
4739,0,," autocracy has , at its root , the premise that only one perspective , or group of perspectives is legitimate .
",
4740,0,," certain assumptions are unquestionable , certain rules inviolable and , more often than not , certain voices unchallengeable .
",
4741,0,," it 's all too easy for that state of affairs to be normalised .
",
4742,0,," community radio offers another voice .
",
4743,0,," more to the point it offers many .
",
4744,0,," as well as the value of the messages themselves , the very fact that they are there and broadcast is a powerful statement against autocratic assumptions .
",
4745,0,," the process of establishing and running a community radio station is , in and of itself , a powerful fillip for community cohesion .
",
4746,1,,"as a gay man i’m biased.
",
4747,1,," as a journalist i’m not.
",
4748,1,," if an event is timely, happens locally, involves conflict and has significant impact, it’s a story.
",
4749,1,," events that fit this classic definition of news happen every day in the middle east and are reported as routine.
",
4750,1,," when stories involve critical elements considered culturally taboo like homosexuality, they are often ignored by state and independent media in an attempt to preserve cultural sensitivities.
",
4751,1,," news is news, and facts should be reported without biases.
",
4752,1,," al-jazeera english’s relatively balanced reports on regional gay issues do not give its arabic counterpart carte blanche to avoid or vilify the subject.
",
4753,1,," news is seldom pleasant.
",
4754,1,," just because some audiences in the middle east might be offended by homosexuality does not mean significant stories should be wiped from the evening news.
",
4755,0,,"- brian pellotjournalists and editors use their judgement all the time on what is acceptable to print or broadcast .
",
4756,0,," expletives or graphic images of violence or sex are routinely prevented because they would cause offence , giving personal details might cause distress and are omitted as a courtesy , and the identities of minors are protected as a point of law in most jurisdictions .
",
4757,0,," it is simply untrue to suggest that journalists report the ` unvarnished truth ' with no regard to its ramifications .
",
4758,0,," where a particular fact or image is likely to cause offence or distress , it is routine to exercise self-censorship -- it 's called discretion and professional judgement .
",
4759,0,," indeed , the news outlets that fail to do so are the ones most frequently and vociferously denounced by the high-minded intelligentsia who so frequently argue that broadcasting issues such as this constitutes free speech .
",
4760,0,," it is palpably and demonstrably true that news outlets seek to avoid offending their market ; so liberal newspapers avoid exposés of bad behaviour by blacks or homosexuals otherwise they would n't have a readership .
",
4761,0,," most journalists try to minimise the harm caused by their reporting as shown by a study interviewing journalists on their ethics but how they define this harm and what they think will cause offence differs .
",
4762,0,," western journalists may find it awkward that many in the arab world find the issue of homosexuality unpleasant or offensive but many of the same journalists would be aghast if they were asked to report activities that ran counter to their cultural sensibilities simply as fact .
",
4763,0,," many have argued that issues relating to homosexual relations are , fundamentally , a matter of privacy .
",
4764,0,," that we should respect the rights of individuals to live their lives as they see fit without having the views , actions and opinions imposed upon them .
",
4765,0,," it 's a reasonable position but must surely relate to viewers and readers as much as it does to the subjects of news stories .
",
4766,0,," if gay men and women have the right to live their lives free from the intervention of other traditions and beliefs then so do those communities -- religious and otherwise -- that find some of their demands offensive or objectionable .
",
4767,0,," if the rights to privacy and self-determination are supported by those who support gay rights , then it would be inconsistent to suggest that this does not generate a right to avoid offence on behalf of those receiving news .
",
4768,0,," ultimately all news outlets report that which is of interest to their viewers .
",
4769,0,," where there is no interest or , more frequently , an active lack of interest , news outlet do not - and should not -- impose a particular set of judgements or interests on their customers .
",
4770,0,," doing so would arguably be patronizing and certainly be financial suicide .
",
4771,0,," as a result they report what is both interesting and acceptable to those who consume the news and , for the vast majority of news outlets , the companies that advertise on the station , website or in the paper .
",
4772,0,," expecting news outlets to ignore those simple realities is asking them to self-destruct by ignoring their market .
",
4773,0,," it is a clear example of sacrificing the good in the name of the best -- in the example given , the writer mentions that al jazeera covers stories relating to gay rights but does so on its english language channels .
",
4774,0,," this exactly shows the market in action ; al jazeera english broadcasts mostly to a european audience who are not offended by reports on gay rights whereas `` al jazeera arabic is geared towards a middle eastern audience and does not challenge cultural values or orthodox religion '' .
",
4775,1,,"the caseour 10th draft principle suggests that we must be free to challenge limits to freedom of expression justified on grounds such as national security.
",
4776,1,," this obviously includes classifications of secrecy.
",
4777,1,," it is impossible to see how the arrest and long imprisonment of xu zerong can be justified in terms of legitimate concerns about national security.
",
4778,1,," the retrospective reclassification of the documents as “top secret” suggests very strongly that this is rather an example of the arbitrary, illegitimate use of state power.
",
4779,1,,"- timothy garton ashdebaters’ notethis motion expands from the egregious specifics of this particular case.
",
4780,1,," there is a very fine line over the point at which issues which may have once been sensitive on the grounds of national security cease to be.
",
4781,1,," how far can a nation go in terms of protecting information that they may wish to use again at some point in the future or preserving historical myth about great leaders of the past.
",
4782,1,," most nations have the capacity to prevent certain records from ever reaching the light of day but this is for the most part rarely used.
",
4783,1,," there is a general rule of thumb that, once all of the participants are dead, then everything is free game but is that a sensible rule or does it just act to protect former tyrants – or incompetents – from legitimate public scrutiny during their lifetime?
",
4784,1,," proposition would need to give a clear definition of these and other issues.
",
4785,1,," where is the debate set and how long can information be protected?
",
4786,1,," critically they need to decide who should decide when information can be released - political leaders tend to be reluctant to encourage prying into the actions of their predecessors, in case people get a taste for it.
",
4787,1,," for many states some historical incidents are so closely tied to the continuing interest of the state it is inconceivable that they would ever want them investigated too closely; this particularly means the revolution that created the state or, conversely, the defeated coup that allowed its continued existence.
",
4788,0,," wars a nation has won and underpin a national mythology can be uncomfortable to examine too closely for generations after the final shot is fired.
",
4789,0,,"all nations have moments in their histories that are unlikely to reflect that country at its best but we judge our own nations and others on a balance of the broad sweep of history rather than the grubby minutiae of particular events .
",
4790,0,," in a much more practical sense historical data may well breach national security .
",
4791,0,," they may well be instances , such as in the case given in the introduction , where governments may even be unaware that there were issues of national security involved until they are brought to light .
",
4792,0,," data that was not significant fifty years ago may become of great significance later on .
",
4793,1,,"the us supreme court's decision on citizens united raises a vital issue: should corporations have the same free speech rights as individuals?
",
4794,1,," brian pellot discusses the case.
",
4795,1,,"the casecitizens united v federal election commission (2010) was a us supreme court decision that in effect declared that first amendment free speech rights apply not only to individuals, but also to corporations and unions.
",
4796,1,," the case arose when the right-wing non-profit corporation citizens united was blocked from airing a documentary critical of hillary clinton before thedemocratic primaries.
",
4797,1,," the ruling overturned a provision set down in the bipartisan campaign reform act ofcurtailing corporation- funded ads that directly name federal candidates.
",
4798,1,," critics of the decision, including president barack obama, argued that unlimited political spending by rich corporations with political agendas would create huge inequalities in speech that could undermine democracy.
",
4799,0,,"- brian pellot corporate personhood is a challenging concept for liberal democracies .
",
4800,0,," on the one hand , the legal fiction that underlies personhood enables groups of citizens to quickly and efficiently join forces to make collective grievances heard and to use weight of numbers to match the influence of wealthier individuals .
",
4801,0,," however , corporations , particularly in the business context , can also be large and unaccountable organisations .
",
4802,0,," this proposition must address two issues .
",
4803,0,," first , whether acts of free expression engaged in by corporations generally should benefit from the same protection as acts of expression engaged in by individuals .
",
4804,0,," second , whether there should be more scrutiny of the membership and objectives of corporations -- or whether corporations should receive rights conditional on their activities .
",
4805,0,," if we follow the reasoning in the citizens united case , which radically changed the interpretation of corporate speech rights in american law , it is clear that acts of corporate speech should benefit from a high standard of protection .
",
4806,0,," corporations can take the form of churches , trades unions or political campaigning groups .
",
4807,0,," the fiction of personhood allows these organisations to operate more freely , ignoring many of the bureaucratic burdens associated with partnership organisations .
",
4808,0,," it also allows citizens to found non-profit making groups , such as pacs , without the risk of being made liable for the debts that those groups generate .
",
4809,0,," profit-led corporations may be used to publish examples of free expression , without necessarily wishing to influence or misuse the ideas expressed .
",
4810,0,," the publishers of political science textbooks , of annotated editions of kapital and of capitalism and freedom are still profit-led businesses .
",
4811,0,," in short , free speech in liberal democracies can not be exercised effectively without the ability to disseminate speech among a large audience , and without the ability to co-operate with others in order to do so .
",
4812,0,," for this reason , where a corporation is permitted to engage in free expression , the contents of its acts of expression should not be subject to restrictions that differ radically from those applied to individual acts of expression .
",
4813,0,," but what about the second issue ?
",
4814,0,," natural persons are allowed - as a general rule - a broad right to free expression .
",
4815,0,," this right is subject to certain caveats , but there is always a presumption that expression should be free and subject to as few limitations as possible .
",
4816,0,," should corporations benefit from the same presumption ?
",
4817,0,," no .
",
4818,0,," the proposition side suggests that corporations ' access to constitutional free speech rights should depend on their goals , objectives and membership .
",
4819,0,," corporations , unlike natural persons , are inflexible in their motives and influences .
",
4820,0,," free speech is preferable to conflict because it acts as a conduit for compromise , but before compromise can take place it must be possible for the participants and audience in a discussion or an exchange of views to be influenced by their opponents ' arguments .
",
4821,0,," profit-led corporations owe a very specific duty to their shareholders - the individual who support and constitute the corporation .
",
4822,0,," under the corporate-laws of almost all liberal democracies , business corporations must act in their interests , and this invariably means generating profit and increasing the value of the equity that each shareholder has in the business .
",
4823,0,," because this duty is a legal one , and failure to uphold it can be cause to remove corporate decision makers , directors and executives , from their jobs and even to bring them to trial .
",
4824,0,," this behavioural imperative is absolute .
",
4825,0,," were a business corporation to announce that it would no longer operate with profit as its core priority , it would collapse .
",
4826,0,," even if this process might not be inevitable in the real world , it still informs corporate culture to a significant degree .
",
4827,0,," natural persons are flexible and pragmatic ; at the very least they have the potential to be so .
",
4828,0,," profit-led corporations are not .
",
4829,0,," free speech rights exercised by a profit-led corporation will always be exercised in the service of the profit motive .
",
4830,0,," the content of public speech is informed as much by the ideas and convictions of individuals engaged in free expression as it is by the concurrent acts of expression engaged in by other individuals .
",
4831,0,," free speech is a product of society and the processes driving the development and growth of society .
",
4832,0,," the environment in which free speech is currently exercised is characterised by pervasive acts of expression -- television commercials , billboards , spam email and advertisements on social media sites .
",
4833,0,," each of these forms of media is aimed at influencing opinions and behaviours .
",
4834,0,," active engagement with a book or a movie is often a prerequisite if an individual is to be influenced by its content , the audience for the content contained in an advert does not necessarily choose to engage with its message .
",
4835,0,," as a result of this , adverts are uniquely placed to bring issues and perspectives to the attention of individuals who might otherwise have been unaware of them .
",
4836,0,," advertising is a powerful political tool .
",
4837,0,," for this reason the manner in which political causes can be advertised and the amount of funding spent on those adverts is , almost without exception , strictly regulated in most liberal democracies .
",
4838,0,," commercial content carried by for-profit organisations such as newspapers and television channels is expensive .
",
4839,0,," the prominence of a message is affected by the amount of money that can be spent on increasing its length , rebroadcasting it and showing it to new audiences .
",
4840,0,," when it comes to political speech , spending money is the best way to increase the efficacy and persuasiveness of a message .
",
4841,0,," irrespective of the qualities of a particular campaign , the qualifications of its candidates or the evidence underlying its policy proposals , its effectiveness will still be measured in the amount of money that it is able to spend on advertising .
",
4842,0,," legal restrictions on political spending are intended to prevent political speech from becoming a battle of budget rather than ideas -- campaign finance laws are designed to protect the integrity , quality and efficacy of speech .
",
4843,0,," in the usa the bi-partisan campaign reform act achieved this goal by preventing corporations from funding `` electioneering communications '' withindays of a caucus ordays of a general election .
",
4844,0,," `` electioneering communications '' were defined by the acts as publications that named a federal candidate , a candidate for a presidential election , for example .
",
4845,0,," the act prevented interest groups indirectly affiliated with particular candidates from spending money to support a candidates ' message .
",
4846,0,," although there are limits on the income that a politician can directly receive from donors , different rules apply to organisations that are not directly affiliated with that politician .
",
4847,0,," and although a politician may receive criticism for receiving corporate money , corporations can contribute to causes indirectly , by providing funds of issue groups .
",
4848,1,,"should yale university refuse to operate in singapore where human rights and free expression face significant restrictions?
",
4849,1,," katie engelhart weighs the arguments for and against.
",
4850,1,,"the caseand yet on balance, i support yale university’s decision to launch yale-nus.
",
4851,1,," some engagement with singaporean students and the city-state itself, however limited, is indeed better than none.
",
4852,1,," educational exchanges have long been conduits for cultural exchange.
",
4853,1,," isolation has not.
",
4854,1,," and miller’s lamentation that yale did not instead open a campus in a city like paris seems out of touch.
",
4855,1,,"as yale university’s president richard levin explained: “we undertook this partnership to advance in asia both the development of liberal arts curriculum and pedagogy encouraging critical inquiry.
",
4856,1,," these in themselves are objectives worthy of a great american institution.”
",
4857,0,,"- katie engelhartthe growth of universities as beacons of free speech has been a fundamental part of their history in the west ; notably during the renaissance , reformation and enlightenment .
",
4858,0,," the democratisation of that process with the expansion of the university sector in recent decades is merely the latest stage in an ongoing process .
",
4859,0,," employers and others expect certain degrees to mean certain things ; they are more than just an expensive badge .
",
4860,0,," in the case of elite western universities part of what that means is a critical approach to the world and the willingness to challenge ideas , regardless of the authority that holds them .
",
4861,0,," part of their exclusivity derives from their admission standards , partly from the academic rigour of their scholars and partly from the simple fact that there are only a relatively small number of graduates .
",
4862,0,," in other areas universities are all too aware of selling their reputation -- impartiality , avoiding plagiarism and so forth -- the same should be true here .
",
4863,0,," if a degree from a western university does not mean that it recognises issues such as creativity and free thinking then it devalues the degree itself .
",
4864,1,,"from the point of view this debate, the status of alternative medicine raises a number of problems, as is always the case with defining terms in the negative.
",
4865,1,," it may be relatively easy to criticize the medical value of “crystal healing”, “psychic surgery” or a laying of hands, but aromatherapy, massage, chiropractic treatments and, notably, homeopathy are slightly harder to attack.
",
4866,1,," however, there is a vibrant debate in all of these areas.
",
4867,1,," in the same way that there are certain areas that prop needs to leave off limits for the debate to work at all the same applies, for op, to some ‘holistic’ treatments that realistically could be prescribed by a mainstream practitioner such as good diet and regular exercise or removing smoking and drinking – whether these are called pathogens or negative forces is, frankly, incidental.
",
4868,1,," as a result this debate will focus on those areas that are contentious.
",
4869,1,," critically, it needs to focus on the extent to which some of the treatments currently on offer are simply an expensive scam.
",
4870,1,," another common criticism is that practitioners who promote their approach as, genuinely, an alternative, rather than a compliment to contemporary medicine can be taking risks with their patients’ health, hopes and even lives.
",
4871,1,,"despite the sheer scale and duration of longitudinal studies conducted by the national centre for complementary and alternative medicine in the us (nccam) not a single study has provided firm proof for the effects that many popular alternative therapies are claimed to have.
",
4872,1,," arguably, of course, the moment science backs something up, it ceases to be alternative.
",
4873,1,," perhaps in the light of this arnold relman, former editor in chief of the new england journal of medicine commented, “there really is no such thing as alternative medicine – only medicine that has been proved to work and medicine that hasn’t”.
",
4874,1,,"on a word of caution it’s easy for this debate to degenerate into either anecdotal evidence or a squabble about the psychosomatic benefits of one therapy or another.
",
4875,1,," generally both are best avoided, after all if op proves the benefits of a placebo it’s not exactly something that is new to science which has been using them since its foundation and the fact that aunt bertha’s hip is much better now that she’s using reflexology is not really a point that lends itself to open debate.
",
4876,0,," there are good reasons why new therapies are tested in scientific trials first , rather than just released on the public that it might work .
",
4877,0,," the first is to weed out side-effects but the other is that if you give most people a medicine they will , not unreasonably , expect it to make them better .
",
4878,0,," an entire industry has grown out of alternative medicines .
",
4879,0,," no doubt many alternative practitioners are well meaning , but this does not change the fact that people are making money out of something that , as far as anyone can determine , is basically snake oil .
",
4880,0,," the national centre for conventional and alternative medicines has spent over $ 2.5 bn on research since.
",
4881,0,," the dutch government funded research betweenand.
",
4882,0,," alternative therapies have been tested in mainstream medical journals and elsewhere .
",
4883,0,," not only have thousands of research exercises failed to prove the medical benefit '' alternative '' treatments for severe and terminal diseases , serious peer-reviewed studies have routinely disproved them .
",
4884,0,," it 's all well and good to pick at mistakes in individual studies .
",
4885,0,," indeed , this tactic often forms the mainstay of pleas for legitimacy made by members of the alternative medical community .
",
4886,0,," however , the odds against such consistently negative results would be extraordinary .
",
4887,0,," by contrast , conventional medicine only prescribes medicines and treatments that are proven , and vigorously proven , to work .
",
4888,0,," equally , the impact of other treatment which may have been used by patients eager to credit complementary and alternative medicines with curing their conditions , tend not to get a look in , neither do the relative successes of conventional medicine .
",
4889,0,," the food supplements industry alone is worth $a year worldwide , with little examination of the medical impact of merrily shoving things into your system that were bought at walmart or tesco .
",
4890,1,,"the cloning of ‘dolly’ the sheep inby ian wilmut and his colleagues at the roslin institute in edinburgh generated a spontaneous worldwide reaction.
",
4891,1,," dr. richard seed, an american geneticist, claimed he would be able to clone human beings within a year.
",
4892,1,," a korean doctor was reported to have created, and killed, the first human clone, but was subsequently found to have fabricated his results.
",
4893,1,," president clinton ordered research into the ethics of human cloning, which subsequently became the shapiro report.
",
4894,1,," the united states has imposed a moratorium on human cloning and a ban on federal funding of cloning research that will be reviewed every five years.
",
4895,1,," one bill to make human cloning lawful and another demanding its prohibition were both rejected by congress in 1999.
",
4896,1,," in britain human therapeutic cloning is legal but requires licenses, reproductive cloning is however illegal.
",
4897,1,," germany, switzerland and several american states have passed laws expressly forbidding human cloning, whereas canada and ireland have no relevant legislation at present.
",
4898,1,," the opposition of international organisations towards human cloning seems clear.
",
4899,1,," the european parliament, the council of europe, unesco and the who have all passed resolutions asserting that human cloning is both morally and legally wrong.
",
4900,1,," there is a clear distinction between ‘reproductive cloning’ and ‘therapeutic cloning’.
",
4901,1,," reproductive cloning relates to the use of the technology with the intention to produce a foetus identical to its parent.
",
4902,1,," the technique used to produce dolly is known as ‘nuclear transfer’, whereby the nucleus from a somatic cell was fused with an unfertilised egg from which the nucleus had been removed.
",
4903,1,," this method of procreation is ‘asexual’, as it does not require one person of each sex in order to produce a child.
",
4904,1,," a single mother or a lesbian couple, for example, could produce a child genetically related to them both, without the necessity for a male gamete.
",
4905,0,," the technology is unsafe .
",
4906,0,," the nuclear transfer technique that produced dolly requiredembryos , from which only one healthy and viable sheep was produced .
",
4907,0,," the other foetuses were hideously deformed and either died or were aborted .
",
4908,0,," even today , cloning animals through somatic cell nuclear transfer is simply inefficient .
",
4909,0,," the success rate ranges from 0.1 percent topercent , which means that for everytries , only one toclones are made .
",
4910,0,," or you can look at it astofailures intries .
",
4911,0,," moreover , ian wilmut and other commentators have noted that we can not know whether clones will suffer from premature ageing as a result of their elderly genes .
",
4912,0,," dolly the sheep herself suffered from premature arthritis .
",
4913,0,," there are also fears that the reprogramming of the nucleus of a somatic cell in order to trigger the cell division that leads to the cloning of an individual may result in a significantly increased risk of cancer .
",
4914,0,," cloning is playing god .
",
4915,0,," it is not merely intervention in the body 's natural processes , but the creation of a new and wholly unnatural process of asexual reproduction .
",
4916,0,," clerics within the catholic , muslim and jewish faiths have all expressed their opposition to human cloning .
",
4917,0,," however , this objection to cloning is not specifically theological .
",
4918,0,," david hume , the eighteenth-century scottish moral philosopher , warned us to heed our feelings as much as our logical reasoning .
",
4919,0,," leon r. kass of the university of chicago has stated in relation to human cloning , that mere failure to produce scientific reasons against the technology does not mean we should deny our strong and instinctive reactions to it .
",
4920,0,," as he states , there is a `` wisdom in repugnance '' .
",
4921,0,," reproductive cloning harms the integrity of the family .
",
4922,0,," single people will be able to produce offspring without even the physical presence of a partner .
",
4923,0,," once born , the child will be denied the love of one parent , most probably the father .
",
4924,0,," several theologians have recognised that a child is a symbolic expression of the mutual love of its parents , and their hope for the future .
",
4925,0,," this sign of love is lost when a child 's life begins in a laboratory .
",
4926,0,," reproductive cloning is contrary to human dignity .
",
4927,0,," ` donum vitae ' , the declaration of the catholic church in relation to the new reproductive technologies , holds that procreation outside the conjugal union is morally wrong .
",
4928,0,," many secular organisations , such as the who and unesco have issued statements that similarly find cloning violates human dignity .
",
4929,0,," assisted reproductive technologies might all be seen as challenges to human dignity , including ivf and sperm donation .
",
4930,0,," however , human cloning is a completely artificial form of reproduction , which leaves no trace of the dignity of human procreation .
",
4931,0,," cloning treats children as objects .
",
4932,0,," children will be manufactured by an expensive technological process that is subject to quality control .
",
4933,0,," the gulf between an artisan and an artefact is immense .
",
4934,0,," individuals will be able to have a child for the sake of having children , or as a symbol of status , rather than because they desire to conceive , love and raise another human being .
",
4935,0,," cloning will not only allow , but actually encourage , the commodification of people .
",
4936,1,,"in the united kingdom, the percentage of children who have had already at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination by their second birthdays was 88.2 % in– 2010.
",
4937,1,," a much higher number than in 2008-2009 (84.9 %) or in 2003-2004 (79.9 %).
",
4938,1,," the who (world health organization) suggests, that for a successful protection of the community% of children need to have the jab.
",
4939,1,,"vaccines represent one of the most successful and effective interventions in medicine and a lucrative business opportunity for many pharmaceutical companies.
",
4940,1,," by vaccinating people, society has been able to eradicate numerous diseases that caused millions of deaths before.
",
4941,1,,"a dramatic example is smallpox, which was responsible for some of the most formidable epidemics of humankind.
",
4942,1,," init was the cause ofmillion deaths; a decade later it was totally eradicated from the planet by a concerted global vaccination program.
",
4943,1,," many countries have thus made it compulsory for people to be vaccinated against various diseases.
",
4944,1,,"as ofchildren in the us, australia, spain and greece must have proof of vaccination before entering the public school system, although it is becoming easier in many states for parents to gain exemptions from this requirement.
",
4945,1,," in the uk there is no such requirement (currently).
",
4946,1,,"prior to a vaccine for polio, between 13,000 and 20,000 cases were reported in the usa annually.
",
4947,1,," in 1988, the world health organization decided to try and eradicate polio worldwide with vaccination, and as of today, the disease has been removed from the usa, western pacific and europe.
",
4948,1,," only four countries (afghanistan, nigeria, india and pakistan) are endemic, and there are justcases reported worldwide annually as of 2009.
",
4949,1,,"but by stopping vaccination before the disease is widely eradicated leaves countries susceptible to future unexpected outbreaks.
",
4950,1,," another common disease – measles, affected nearly everyone in the united states prior to the vaccination being introduced.
",
4951,1,," betweenand 1963, there weredeaths each year from the disease.
",
4952,1,," currently in the us, three of everypeople who contract measles will die, whilst in the developing world, one inwill die.
",
4953,1,," it is estimated that 90% of people who are exposed to the virus will get infected if not vaccinated against it.
",
4954,1,," inaccording to the who, there were 900,000 measles related deaths worldwide.
",
4955,1,," measles can spread rapidly amongst unvaccinated populations, and if vaccinations were stopped, the who estimate there could be 2.7 million measles related deaths worldwide annually.
",
4956,1,,"type b meningitis was prior to the vaccine the most common form of bacterial meningitis in us infants, with 20,000 annual cases, with one inproving either fatal or leaving the child with some form of disability.
",
4957,1,," since the vaccine became available in 1987, the number of cases has reduced by 98%, with fewer than ten fatalities a year.
",
4958,1,," these are just a few examples of how vaccines can prevent and eradicate diseases that have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths throughout the past century.
",
4959,1,," although some may argue that with diseases such as polio wiped out in most of the world a vaccine is not necessary.
",
4960,1,," however any reduction in the number of people vaccinated against the disease would leave a window of opportunity for the disease to rear its head up once again.
",
4961,1,,"even though benefits are much greater if everyone is vaccinated than if not, some people choose not to be vaccinated, and have concerns about certain vaccines.
",
4962,1,," simultaneously the number of people vaccinated rose as did the movements against the notion of compulsory vaccination, such as the society of anti vaccinations (1798) and the anti- vaccination league (1853).
",
4963,1,,"there should be as few obstacles as possible to such a program in order to save as many lives as possible.
",
4964,1,," some might argue that, that the government should not be able to force someone to have a needle stuck into them?
",
4965,1,," they might also say that if they wish to take the risk of not having the vaccine that is their choice.
",
4966,1,," however many claim, that because the risks do not just affect them, but the people around them, people should not be allowed to choose vaccines on their own.
",
4967,1,,"  so, this essentially this debate boils down to personal liberty vs. the good of the entire society.
",
4968,0,," if an age group is protected , that results in a better health conditions for the whole society .
",
4969,0,," in an industrialized country such as the usa , those choosing exemption from statutorily compulsory vaccination were 35-times more likely to contract measles than vaccinated persons ; in developing countries where these viruses are still endemic , the risk would be considerably higher .
",
4970,0,," those who wish to opt-out of vaccination , often on behalf of their children , who have no say in the matter , are classic free riders , hoping to benefit from the more responsible behavior of the rest of society .
",
4971,0,," as it is assumed that most of society see it as a responsibility and a duty to protect others .
",
4972,0,," after a scare about possible side effects of the mmr jab , inthere was a drop in voluntary vaccinations in a part of london , lewisham .
",
4973,0,," in that part of london only 64.3 % of children were vaccine and in that year the district accounted one third of all south-east london measles cases .
",
4974,0,," unless there is a% vaccination , there is a great threat to public health of infection outbreaks .
",
4975,0,," it is therefore the role of the state to understand these issues and possible treats and provide a duty of protection and care , in this case , in the form of immunization .
",
4976,0,," another example of the need to protect is also given by the example of voluntary vaccination against the flu , because of its impacts on the whole population is given by pediatric studies : '' in several studies , results indicated that a% vaccination rate among health care personnel in acute care settings triggered a% decline in risk of influenza among patients .
",
4977,0,," this decrease appeared even higher --% -- among nursing home patients . ''
",
4978,0,," so by giving up some of the individuals freedoms and the feeling of duty to protection , the community is much more protected and benefits from the vaccination of the community .
",
4979,0,," as articleof the united nations convention on the rights of the child states , `` state parties shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to health services . ''
",
4980,0,," each year millions of children worldwide die of preventable diseases before the age of five .
",
4981,0,," the argument presented here is that the state needs to protect the child and immunize him or her from preventable diseases as obviously the child does not have the capabilities at this stage to make informed decisions of their own .
",
4982,0,," the united nations right to liberty and security of the person treaty , article 6.2 supports this view - state parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child .
",
4983,0,," it is up to the state to decide if a child is to be immunized , as overall it will be the state who would benefit from having the vast majority of its citizens vaccinated , and it will be the state who will have to pay for any treatment needed to treat a preventable disease .
",
4984,0,," whilst a child 's parents have to a certain degree the right to decide what is best for their child 's future , poor decision making in this area could result in serious medical issues for the nation .
",
4985,0,," in this extremely important area , the state must have authority over the rights of the parent .
",
4986,0,," commonly-used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health , compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease .
",
4987,0,," in the u.s. during the year, routine childhood immunizations against seven diseases were estimated to save over $billion per birth-year cohort in overall social costs including $billion in direct health costs , and the societal benefit-cost ratio for these vaccinations was estimated to be 16.5 billion .
",
4988,0,," another aspect is also , that productivity rates remain high and less money is earmarked for social and health transfers because people are healthier .
",
4989,0,," this is also supported by a who study , that claims : `` we calculate that the average percentage increase in income for the children whose immunization coverage increases through will rise from 0.78 per cent into 2.39 per cent by.
",
4990,0,," this equates to an increase in annual earnings per child of $by.
",
4991,0,," the total increase in income per year once the vaccinated cohort of children start earning will rise from $million into $ 1.34 billion by, at a cost of $million inand $million in. ''
",
4992,0,," this study based on economic and health indicators is part of the world immunization program gavi .
",
4993,1,,"a generic drug is ""a drug product that is comparable to brand/reference listed drug product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality and performance characteristics, and intended use""1.
",
4994,1,," india, brazil, thailand, south africa and even smaller african countries such as zambia, ghana, tanzania, uganda and zimbabwe produce generic drugs2.
",
4995,1,," the production of generic drugs is a controversial issue due to the existence of patent protections on most pharmaceutical products that current law considers to be the property of the firms that produced them.
",
4996,1,," proponents of generic drugs point out the extremely high prices charged for brand name drugs as compared to generics when they are permitted, as well as the needs of the developing world for cheap drugs in their battle with various life-threatening diseases as reasons to circumvent conventional patent law and to permit the production of generics generally.
",
4997,1,," opponents of generic drugs hold that the patent rights are essential in order to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new and better drugs and that generic drugs are potentially harmful.
",
4998,0,," debates center around the issues of the inviolability of patents, the needs of the developing world for drugs and how best to meet them, and whether generic drugs can be a suitable and cheaper alternative to conventional brand name drugs.
",
4999,0,,"the current drug patent regime is largely designed to benefit and shield the profits of large pharmaceutical companies .
",
5000,0,," this is due to the fact that most of the laws on drug patents were written by lobbyists and voted upon by politicians in the pay of those firms .
",
5001,0,," the pharmaceutical industry is simply massive and has one of the most powerful lobbies in most democratic states , particularly the united states .
",
5002,0,," the laws are orchestrated to contain special loopholes , which these firms can exploit in order to maximize profits at the expense of the taxpayer and of justice .
",
5003,0,," for example , through a process called `` evergreening '' , drug firms essentially re-patent drugs when they near expiration by patenting certain compounds or variations of the drug1 .
",
5004,0,," this can extend the life of some patents indefinitely ensuring firms can milk customers at monopoly prices long after any possible costs of research or discovery are recouped .
",
5005,0,," a harm that arises from this is the enervating effect that patents can generate in firms .
",
5006,0,," when the incentive is to simply rest on one 's patents , waiting for them to expire before doing anything else , societal progress is slowed .
",
5007,0,," in the absence of such patents , firms are necessarily forced to keep innovating to stay ahead , to keep looking for profitable products and ideas .
",
5008,0,," the free flow of ideas generated by the abolition of drug patents will invigorate economic dynamism .
",
5009,0,," many developing countries are fraught with terrible disease .
",
5010,0,," much of africa and asia are devastated by malaria , and in many parts of africa aids is a horrendous scourge , infecting large percentages of many countries populations .
",
5011,0,," for example , in swaziland ,% of the adult population is infected with the virus1 .
",
5012,0,," in light of these obscenely high infection rates , african governments have sought to find means of acquiring enough drugs to treat their ailing populations .
",
5013,0,," the producers of the major aids medications do donate substantial amounts of drugs to stricken countries , yet at the same time they charge ruinously high prices for that which they do sell , leading to serious shortages in countries that can not afford them .
",
5014,0,," the denial of the right to produce or acquire generic drugs is effectively a death sentence to people in these countries .
",
5015,0,," with generic drugs freely available on the market , the access to such drugs would be facilitated far more readily and cheaply ; prices would be pushed down to market levels and african governments would be able to stand a chance of providing the requisite care to their people2 .
",
5016,0,," under the current system attempts by governments to access generic drugs can be met by denials of free treatments , leading to even further suffering .
",
5017,0,," there is no ethical justification to allow pharmaceutical companies to charge artificially high prices for drugs that save lives .
",
5018,0,," furthermore , many firms that develop and patent drugs do not share them , nor do they act upon them themselves due to their unprofitability .
",
5019,0,," this has been the case with various treatments for malaria , which affects the developing world almost exclusively , thus limiting the market to customers with little money to pay for the drugs3 .
",
5020,0,," the result is patents and viable treatments sitting on shelves , effectively gathering dust within company records , when they could be used to save lives .
",
5021,0,," but when there is no profit there is no production .
",
5022,0,," allowing the production of generic drugs is to allow justice to be done in the developing world , saving lives and ending human suffering .
",
5023,0,," the sale of generic drugs invariably reduces costs to consumers .
",
5024,0,," this is due to two reasons .
",
5025,0,," it may be the case that an individual or firm with a patent , essentially a monopoly right to the production of something , may not have the ability to efficiently go about meeting demand for it .
",
5026,0,," patents slow , or even stop the dissemination of the production methods , especially when a patent-holder is unwilling to license production to others1 .
",
5027,0,," such an outcome is deleterious to society , as with no restrictions on drug production an efficient producer , or producers , will emerge to meet the needs of the public , producing an amount of drugs commensurate with demand , and thus equilibrating market price with that demand2 .
",
5028,0,," this market equilibration is impossible under conventional patent laws , as it is in the interest of firms to withhold production and to engage in monopolist rent-seeking from consumers3 .
",
5029,0,," this leads firms to deliberately under-produce , which they have been shown to do in many cases , as for example the case of miacalcic , a drug used to treat paget 's disease , in which its producer deliberately kept production down in order to keep prices high4 .
",
5030,0,," when a firm is given monopoly power over a drug it has the ability to abuse it , and history shows that is what they are wont to do .
",
5031,0,," by allowing the production of generic drugs , this monopoly power is broken and people can get the drugs they need at costs that are not marked far above their free market value .
",
5032,0,," patent regimes cause firms to inefficiently allocate resources .
",
5033,0,," one such inefficiency arises from the duplication of effort by firms seeking to develop the same or very similar drugs , though only the first to do so may profit from it due to the winner-takes-all patent system .
",
5034,0,," this leads to brutal races and excessive expenditure of resources to be first over the line and to monopolize the production , at least for a time .
",
5035,0,," these races can thus lead to efforts by firms to steal research from one another , thus resulting in further wastes of resources in engaging and attempting to prevent corporate espionage .
",
5036,0,," another serious inefficiency arises in the production of similar products to existing ones , seeking to get around existing patents .
",
5037,0,," such has been the case for years in the pharmaceutical industry , which has succeeded , for example , in curing erectile dysfunction dozens of times .
",
5038,0,," an overemphasis on such spinning off of similar products is the result of patent-generated inefficiency.
",
5039,0,," the inefficiency does not end with production , however , as firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecuting offenders , all of which generates huge costs and little or no return.
",
5040,0,," furthermore , the deterrent effect to patent piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .
",
5041,0,," clearly , in the absence of patent protection for pharmaceuticals , markets and firms will behave more efficiently .
",
5042,0,," this is shown by the introduction of generic antiretroviral drugs for treating aids where the introduction of generic drugs forced the price of the branded drugs down from $to $in september/october3 .
",
5043,0,," an individual 's idea , so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden , belongs to him .
",
5044,0,," when he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public , it becomes part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it .
",
5045,0,," if individuals or firms want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product .
",
5046,0,," one should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has , since no such ownership right exists1 .
",
5047,0,," no one can own an idea .
",
5048,0,," thus recognizing something like a property right over something like a drug formula is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their asset .
",
5049,0,," physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .
",
5050,0,," ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once spoken , enters the public domain and belongs to everyone .
",
5051,0,," this should apply all the more with vital drugs that are fundamentally for the public good by improving health .

",
5056,1,,"as our knowledge of surgical and diagnostic techniques has increased with time, so has the success rate of organ transplants.
",
5057,1,," however, the number of patients who require organ transplants exceeds the number of organs available, particularly if the patient has a rare blood type or belongs to an ethnic minority where organ donations are even lower than normal.
",
5058,1,," for example, although black people are three times more likely than the general population to develop kidney failure, and the asian community has a particularly high demand for organs, organ donation within these groups is relatively low.
",
5059,1,," it is important for the donor and recipient to have the same blood type and similar genetic make-up in order to minimize the change of the receiver’s body rejecting the organ.
",
5060,1,," more than 10,000 people in the uk currently need a transplant, and 1,000 people die every year while on the waiting list.
",
5061,1,," in the us, over 100,000 people are still on the waiting list.
",
5062,1,," although these figures are astonishing in themselves, the genuine figure is probably higher, inflated by the deaths of patients who are never waitlisted for a transplant.
",
5063,1,," some patients are never placed on the waiting list because they have certain habits – such as smoking – and the precious few organs available are prioritised for patients who fit recipient categories.
",
5064,1,,"the sale of human organs offers a possible solution to this crippling shortage of organs.
",
5065,1,," there is already an established black market trade in organs.
",
5066,1,," entrepreneurs offer british and western patients the opportunity to receive privately financed transplants in countries such as india and malaysia.
",
5067,1,," in 2006, investigators discovered that chinese hospitals were providing organ transplants using the organs of executed prisoners.
",
5068,1,," in 1983, dr. barry jacobs requested that the us government should create a fund to compensate the families who donate the organs of their deceased relatives.
",
5069,1,," he also proposed a business plan to buy kidneys from living donors to transplant to american patients.
",
5070,1,," however, these is still plenty of opposition to these ideas, and the national organ transplantation act ofstill prohibits the sale of human organs from both dead and living donors.
",
5071,1,,"the proposition line could argue that organs are the property of the donors, and so they have a right to do with them as they wish.
",
5072,1,," in this case of buying human organs, it is much easier to argue that the profits would go to the donor rather than (for example) hospitals or governments which may not have a vested interest in those concerned.
",
5073,1,," it would be useful to outline in the mechanism that these organs will be transferred through a unique medical group or business which has the technology available to match up donors to potential recipients and so avoid potential medical complications as far as possible.
",
5074,1,," after this, it would be like any other financial transaction.
",
5075,1,," this will focus on the united kingdom, but the arguments would be relevant to most countries considering this policy change.
",
5076,0,," the ethics of private healthcare are not in question here ; indeed , the uk government has stated that as many people as possible should be encouraged to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resources .
",
5077,0,," critics have understood this as the government prolonging waiting lists until the patients ` remove themselves ' either by going private , or dying .
",
5078,0,," there is , however , a general understanding that the nhs in the uk is overburdened and that increased private healthcare would help to balance this .
",
5079,0,," meanwhile , in the us , private healthcare is the norm .
",
5080,0,," allowing the sale of organs is merely an extension of this principle and provides utilitarian benefit .
",
5081,0,," not only would those who are able to pay for an organ enjoy a much better chance at recovery , but there would be more time , space , and resources for the people who could not afford to do this privately .
",
5082,0,," legalisation can help to eliminate the corruption currently associated with the organ market .
",
5083,0,," it can also make it easy to regulate , and so safer .
",
5084,0,," given the mystery of the black market , medical complications are much more likely ; it is necessary to match the donor and recipient together , but this can not be easily done when every step of the organ collection and donation must be hidden for fear of prosecution .
",
5085,0,," legalisation could also stop the ` theft ' or organs and abuse of people like chinese prisoners who are currently exploited for their organs -- authorities will become accountable to a publicly recognised and enforced system .
",
5086,0,," the proposition is not concerned with live people trying to donate their hearts , or other vital organs which they can not live without .
",
5087,0,," no matter how impoverished that person might be , they will not choose certain death for a cash payoff .
",
5088,0,," however , organs like kidneys , and sections of liver , can be and often are donated from a live donor without significant lasting damage .
",
5089,0,," it is patronising to forbid an individual to sell or donate an organ when it is possible for them to live without it .
",
5090,0,," similarly , the family of a deceased relative , as next of kin , should have the right to receive financial remuneration from their organs .
",
5091,0,," given that the doctors , nurses and surgeons who work around organ transplants are all paid , it is nonsensical that the donor , the most important figure in the organ transplant , should be left out .
",
5092,0,," the united states already allows markets for sperm , blood , human eggs and surrogate wombs .
",
5093,0,," there is no good reason why organs should be excluded when these other human products are not ; there is no moral difference between a kidney and an ovum .
",
5094,0,," moreover , organ donation is a lifesaving process , whereas sperm and egg donation are not .
",
5095,0,," simply put , incentivizing donations through payment will save the lives of many patients in need .
",
5096,0,," the payment from these organs could also hugely improve the quality of life of the donors by lifting them out of debt , or allowing struggling individuals , such as students , to improve their career potential by paying for their university fees .
",
5097,1,,"teenage pregnancy rates are on the rise, and contraceptives are often hailed as the underlying cause.
",
5098,1,," however, few people agree on why contraceptives might be causing an increase in pregnancy rates.
",
5099,1,," some believe that a lack of contraceptives has led to more unprotected sex among young girls who choose to take that risk; others claim that the availability of contraceptives encourages young girls to underestimate the emotional and physical impact of having sex at a young age.
",
5100,1,," it is very difficult to reach an absolute conclusion either way because of the difficulties of gathering data about whether underage girls have engaged in sexual activity.
",
5101,1,," they may refuse to tell, or falsely say that they have been sexually active as a result of peer pressure to have sex.
",
5102,1,,"            a high teenage pregnancy rate damages to the girls’ career or life prospects, and for society it often creates a financial and social burden to support the children and young mothers.
",
5103,1,," while doctors are bound by the principles of medical ethics to aid their patients as far as possible, providing contraceptives to under-age girls can be seen as undermining the purpose of the law against under-age intercourse because it provides a ‘safe’ way for them to break that law.
",
5104,1,," it can also put doctors in an uncomfortable position if they feel that the girl will have intercourse without contraception if they refuse to prescribe it, at which point they may feel that they are failing to help the patient to avoid physical and mental health issues which could potentially result from unprotected sex.
",
5105,1,,"            the mechanism for this debate is that doctors should be able to prescribe contraception to young girls, even if they have not yet reached the legal age of consent, as long as they satisfy certain conditions already laid out by medical authorities such as the british medical association.
",
5106,1,," in this case, under the rules for informed consent, the patient must be ‘aware of’ and have ‘genuinely understood the hazards and benefits of various methods of contraception.’
",
5107,1,,"  doctors must also ‘make sure that patients are able to use the chosen method properly and can recognise and cope with side effects.’
",
5108,1,," this mechanism does not impose an absolute limit to contraceptive prescriptions based on age, but rather assesses each patient as an individual to ascertain whether that personally are ready for a sexual relationship.
",
5109,1,," this upholds medical ethics in that the doctor’s concern should be ‘the welfare of the patient concerned’ – basing individual prescriptions on individual need – rather than imposing a uniform age restriction.
",
5110,0,," refusing to prescribe contraceptives for girls below the age of consent assumes that no under-age girls can make an informed decision to choose a sexual relationship .
",
5111,0,," medical advice and prescriptions should be given on an individual , rather than uniform , basis .
",
5112,0,," as long as these girls meet the requirements for consent laid out by the relevant medical authority , there should be no reason for contraceptives should be denied to them .
",
5113,0,," the decision of whether an individual is ready to engage in a sexual relationship is a purely personal one ; refusing contraceptives places them at unnecessarily medical risk , both physically and mentally , and does not adhere to the duty of care by doctors for their patients .
",
5114,0,," although it is almost impossible to absolutely prevent underage sex , as already shown by rising teen pregnancy rates in the us , the uk and across europe , it is possible to encourage safe sex .
",
5115,0,," sex education programmes which teach abstinence rarely seem to deter sexual activity or prevent teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections .
",
5116,0,," however , studies researching the effect of providing contraceptives in schools have found that there was ` no increase in sexual activity ' .
",
5117,0,," if this principle was extended to include the many different types of contraception available by prescription , this could feasibly help to lower high teenage pregnancy rates ; for example , the prescribed pill has a higher efficiency rate than condoms , which are often available in schools or clinics but used inefficiently .
",
5118,0,," devices like the iud also remove any problems of girls forgetting to take their pills on time .
",
5119,0,," allowing under-age girls to be able to talk to a doctor and receive the form of contraception which is best fitting for them would actively tackle rising teen pregnancy rates .
",
5120,0,," the decision to have sex is an incredibly subjective one .
",
5121,0,," some girls might be ready at, others may not be ready until they are in their twenties or older .
",
5122,0,," in fact , the age where girls enter puberty has become progressively younger ; so , whereasmight be considered an average age to begin puberty , some girls can begin puberty as young asyears old .
",
5123,0,," however , in either case or early or of late development , the subjective decision of sexual maturity should not be permitted or outlawed by a system which takes no personal account of the individual ; the only person who can judge if they are ready is the girl herself .
",
5124,0,," disallowing doctors to prescribe contraceptives to young girls impedes their duties of medical ethics .
",
5125,0,," the principle of beneficence instructs that doctors should do good for their patients .
",
5126,0,," if a young girl is in danger of an unplanned pregnancy and the potential medical complications which accompany it , a doctor should not deny her help if she asks for it and is medically suitable for the contraceptives .
",
5127,0,," for example , she must be within the parameters for weight and blood pressure to take the combined pill , without undue likelihood of blood clots and other potential risks .
",
5128,0,," it is contradictory to give doctors the right to judge their patient 's best interests , but simultaneously prevent them from acting in their professional capacity .
",
5129,0,," by visiting the doctor , young girls have more access to information which they might not get from their school sex education .
",
5130,0,," given that , in the united states , there is ` no federal mandate to teach sex education ' in public schools , and ` less than half of all public schools ... offer information on how to obtain birth control ' , it is patently clear that the current educational system fails to address the needs of young adolescents in this respect .
",
5131,0,," a doctor 's surgery or clinic is a more private environment for young girls to ask for clarification , without intimidation from male or female peers , which encourages education and makes sure that the girls are more fully informed before they have sex .
",
5132,0,," this would allow resources to be focused on the big killers other than tobacco -- including hiv aids .
",
5133,0,," a ban on smoking in public places would help reduce the rates of people smoking , by making it appear socially unusual -- people will have to leave enclosed public places to smoke , each time they want to smoke .
",
5134,0,," this is particularly important in africa which is at an early stage of the tobacco epidemic where it can be prevented from ever coming to be seen as being normal .
",
5135,0,," a ban on smoking in public places at this stage would stop tobacco gaining the widespread social acceptability that caused it to thrice in the 20th century in the global north .
",
5136,0,," the solution is to get the solutions in now , not later .
",
5137,1,,"on march 23rd 2010, u.s. president barack obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act, an act the new york times calls “the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades”.
",
5138,1,,"the law’s purpose is to insuremillion more americans by expanding medicaid and introducing federal subsidies aimed at lower-income citizens to aid them in buying private health insurance.
",
5139,1,," it will also prohibit insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, create a panel of experts to reduce government reimbursements under medicare and create incentives for better, bundled services.
",
5140,1,,"however, not all share this vision of the bill and the idea it stands for.
",
5141,1,," including the successful vote for repealing the legislation in the house, there have been numerous legal challenges launched against it, charging it with being unconstitutional, splitting judges’ in addition to politicians’ opinions down ideological lines.
",
5142,1,,"additionally, vermont has recently adopted legislature with the aim of introducing a single-payer form of healthcare, a system where a single provider, usually the government, by 2017, provides all the financing.
",
5143,1,,"with the legislature and the judiciary involved with their arguments, there weremillion uninsured americans in 2010,million new on account of unemployment, making the need for such a policy more necessary than ever.
",
5144,1,," yet on the other hand, the economic downturn shows no signs of abating, thus making the adoption of 930bn dollar bill a costly enterprise for the government and, therefore, for the average taxpayer.
",
5145,0,," with universal health care , people are able to seek preventive treatment .
",
5146,0,," this means having tests and check-ups before they feel ill , so that conditions can be picked up in their early stages when they are easy to treat .
",
5147,0,," for example in a recent study% of women with health insurance knew their cholesterol level , while only% of uninsured women did .
",
5148,0,," in the end , people who do not get preventive health care will get treatment only when their disease is more advanced .
",
5149,0,," as a result their care will cost more and the outcomes are likely to be much worse .
",
5150,0,," preventative care , made more accessible , can function the same way , reducing the costs further .
",
5151,0,," in addition , a single-payer system reduces the administrative costs .
",
5152,0,," a different way of charging for the care , not by individual services but by outcomes , as proposed by obama 's bill , also changes incentives from as many tests and procedures as possible to as many patients treated and healed as possible .
",
5153,0,," we thus see that not only does universal health coverage inherently decrease costs because of preventative care , much of the cost can be avoided if implemented wisely and incentivized properly .
",
5154,0,," american health insurance payments are very high and rising rapidly .
",
5155,0,," even employer-subsidised programs are very expensive for many americans , because they often require co-payments or high deductibles , payment for the first part of any treatment .
",
5156,0,," in any case employee health benefits are being withdrawn by many companies as a way of cutting costs .
",
5157,0,," for those without insurance , a relatively minor illness or injury can be a financial disaster .
",
5158,0,," it is unfair that many ordinary hard-working americans can no longer afford decent medical treatment .
",
5159,0,," moving to a system of universal health care would reduce the burden on human resources personnel in companies .
",
5160,0,," at present they must make sure the company is obeying the very many federal laws about the provision of health insurance .
",
5161,0,," with a universal system where the government was the single-payer , these regulations would not apply and the costs of american businesses would be much reduced .
",
5162,0,," the two crucial dimensions of the topic of introducing universal health care are morality and the affordability .
",
5163,0,," paragraphof articleof the universal declaration of human rights states the following : `` everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care and necessary social services , and the right to security in the event of unemployment , sickness , disability , widowhood , old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control . ''
",
5164,0,," analyzing the text , we see that medical care , in so far , as it provides adequate health and well-being is considered a human right by the international community .
",
5165,0,," in addition , it also states , that this right extends also to periods of unemployment , sickness , disability , and so forth .
",
5166,0,," despite this , why should we consider health care a human right ?
",
5167,0,," because health is an essential prerequisite for a functional individual -- one that is capable of free expression for instance -- and a functional society -- one capable of holding elections , not hampered by communicable diseases , to point to just one example .
",
5168,0,," universal health care provided by the state to all its citizens is the only form of health care that can provide what is outlined in the declaration .
",
5169,0,," in the us the only conditions truly universally covered are medical emergencies .
",
5170,0,," but life without the immediate danger of death hardly constitutes an adequate standard of health and well-being .
",
5171,0,," additionally , programs such as medicaid and medicare do the same , yet again , only for certain parts of the population , not really providing the necessary care for the entire society .
",
5172,0,," further , the current system of health care actively removes health insurance from the unemployed , since most ,% , of americans are insured through their employers -- thus not respecting the provision that demands care also in the case of unemployment .
",
5173,0,," but does insurance equal health care ?
",
5174,0,," in a word : yes .
",
5175,0,," given the incredible cost of modern and sophisticated medical care -- a colonoscopy can cost more thandollars -- in practice , those who are not insured are also not treated .
",
5176,0,," it is unconstitutional to require individuals to buy private insurance , and penalize them for not doing so , that is , penalizing their non-act , their omission to purchase insurance .
",
5177,0,," as david b. rivkin jr. and lee a. casey argue : `` ... can congress require every american to buy health insurance ?
",
5178,0,," in short , no .
",
5179,0,," the constitution assigns only limited , enumerated powers to congress and none , including the power to regulate interstate commerce or to impose taxes , would support a federal mandate requiring anyone who is otherwise without health insurance to buy it . ''
",
5180,0,,"  the congressional budget office believes `` a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action .
",
5181,0,," the government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the united states . ''
",
5182,0,,"  an individual mandate would have two features that , in combination , would make it unique .
",
5183,0,," first , it imposes a duty on individuals due to them being members of society .
",
5184,0,," second , it requires the purchase of a specific service on pain of tax penalties if that product is not purchased .
",
5185,0,,"  as noted by sen. john ensign , a nevada republican : `` anything we have ever done , somebody actually had to have an action before we could tax or regulate it . ''
",
5186,0,,"  as robert a. levy and michael f. cannon of the cato institute argue : `` congress ' attempt to punish a non-act that harms no one is an intolerable affront to the constitution , liberty , and personal autonomy .
",
5187,0,," that shameful fact can not be altered by calling it health-care reform . ''
",
5188,0,,"  the individual healthcare insurance mandate would , for the first time , mean the government setting uo a monopoly or a cartel with which every citizen of the us would be compelled - by a statutory power - to do business .
",
5189,0,," this destroys any pretence of individual market freedom , individuals would be required to contribute money out of each and every pay check they earned to either a government entity which would be staffed and/or controlled by political appointees or to a cartel made up of companies that would owe their continued existence on the cartel list to the acquiescence of political overseers .
",
5190,0,," either way , the reduction in individual autonomy and freedom over health care choices would be dramatically decreased and inevitably politicized .
",
5191,0,," this has obvious worrying possibilities for corruption , the party in power would favour those who donate to the party .
",
5192,0,,"  enforcing the mandate may also intrude on constitutional rights .
",
5193,0,," sherry glied , ph.d. , assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the u.s. department of health and human services has warned , `` , d , eveloping a system to promptly identify and penalize scofflaws , people who flout the law , will take effort and ingenuity , particularly in our diverse and mobile country .
",
5194,0,," it may require a degree of intrusiveness and bureaucracy that some will find unpalatable . ''
",
5195,0,,"  this is likely to mean much more intrusive inspection , for example hospitals having to report to the government patients they have who do n't have health insursnce ,  this is why a majority of the states , and numerous organizations and individual persons , have filed actions in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate , and several courts have already struck it down on constitutional grounds .
",
5196,0,,"  for all these reasons it is clear that for congress to try to penalize a non-act is an unprecedented and unconstitutional power grab , and so the individual mandate is unconstitutional .
",
5197,0,," it has been argued that the individual healthcare mandate is authorised by the constitution 's empowerment of congress to `` regulate interstate commerce '' , known as the `` commerce clause '' , however this is not true and the commerce clause does not authorize health insurance mandates .
",
5198,0,," as the congressional research service has written : `` despite the breadth of powers that have been exercised under the commerce clause , it is unclear whether the clause would provide a solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a requirement to have health insurance .
",
5199,0,," whether such a requirement would be constitutional under the commerce clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal , as it is a novel issue whether congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service . ''
",
5200,0,,"  the most obvious reason for this is that an omission to buy health insurance can in no way be termed ` interstate commerce ' , as there is no activity or commerce going on .
",
5201,0,," this is not in keeping with the commerce clause , unlike other previous federal healthcare laws .
",
5202,0,," there is no doubt that congress can regulate an entire array of economic activities , large and small , inter - and intra-state .
",
5203,0,," thus , for example , there is no problem , constitution-wise with having congress regulate health care insurance purchase transactions .
",
5204,0,," the problem with an individual insurance purchase mandate , however , is that it does not regulate any transactions at all ; it regulates human beings , simply because they exist , and orders them to engage in certain types of economic transactions .
",
5205,0,,"  while most health care insurers and health care providers may engage in interstate commerce and may be regulated accordingly under the commerce clause , it is a different matter to find a basis for imposing commerce clause related regulation on an individual citizen who chooses not to undertake a commercial transaction .
",
5206,0,," the decision not to engage in affirmative conduct is arguably distinguishable from cases in which commerce clause regulatory authority was recognized over intra-state activity : growing wheat , for example , wickard v. filmore , or , more recently , growing marijuana , gonzales v. raich .
",
5207,0,,"  in the case of a mandate to purchase health insurance or face a tax or penalty , congress would have to explain how not doing something -- not buying insurance and not seeking health care services -- implicated interstate commerce .
",
5208,0,,"  therefore , it is clear that congress is not empowered to regulate the choice not to buy healthcare , as it lacks constitutional authorisation to interfere in this aspect of individual americans ' private lives .
",
5209,0,," the vertical separation of powers , under which the federal government possesses limited and enumerated powers , while the states wield general powers , including the right to operate their own police forces , is a key part of america 's constitutional architecture .
",
5210,0,," far from being an 18th century affectation , these structural limitations on government powers were designed to protect individual liberty .
",
5211,0,," in the framers ' view , limiting the ability of the federal government to exercise authority was core to ensuring that no single government entity would grow too powerful .
",
5212,0,," this is because , under the supremacy clause , any constitutionally compliant federal legislation trumps exercises of individual state 's powers .
",
5213,0,," therefore , an infinitely capacious commerce clause , which would be produced if the mandating of healthcare were to be allowed , would rob states of any remaining authority .
",
5214,0,,"  when any choice or non-action which has economic impacts becomes termed as `` economic '' , every aspect of consumer behaviour , or , for that matter , any aspect of individual behaviour , would become an economic activity , and thus nothing would fall outside of congress ' power to regulate under the commerce clause .
",
5215,0,,"  the individual health insurance mandate would set dangerous precedents for federal power .
",
5216,0,," the congressional budget office acknowledged the unprecedented nature of an individual mandate when assessing the clinton health care reform proposal of: `` a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action .
",
5217,0,," the government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the united states .
",
5218,0,," an individual mandate has two features that , in combination , make it unique .
",
5219,0,," first , it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society .
",
5220,0,," second , it would require people to purchase a specific service that would have to be heavily regulated by the federal government . ''
",
5221,1,,"tobacco is one of the most widely-used recreational drugs in the world; mainly in the form of cigarettes, but also in cigars and pipes, and in combination with cannabis and marijuana in 'joints'.
",
5222,1,," although most countries put age restrictions on its use, over a billion adults smoke tobacco legally every day, and supplying this demand is big business.
",
5223,1,," as well as having serious health consequences for smokers themselves, the pollution of other people's atmospheres with cigarette smoke also makes this an environmental issue.
",
5224,1,," attitudes have changed rapidly over the past twenty years.
",
5225,1,,"in the developed world, public opinion has shifted against smoking.
",
5226,1,," by the 1990s, the sheer weight of evidence had forced major tobacco companies to admit that their products are both harmful and addictive.
",
5227,1,," many governments have substantially increased taxes on tobacco in order to discourage smoking, and often to alleviate the economic costs of smoking-related illness.
",
5228,1,," however, while smoking has declined amongst some groups, it has increased amongst others - particularly young women.
",
5229,1,," meanwhile restrictions on the industry in the developed world have seen a new emphasis on developing nations, and new markets.
",
5230,1,," governments have decided on imposing many strategies to reduce the number of smokers.
",
5231,1,,"key questions for this debate are: is it the proper role of government to legislate to protect citizens from the harmful effects of their own lifestyle decisions?
",
5232,1,," does tobacco advertising increase tobacco consumption?
",
5233,1,," do health warnings, however much of the cigarette packet they cover, reduce consumption?
",
5234,1,," what would be the effects of banning smoking in all public places, or even completely?
",
5235,1,,"this focuses on the question, what is the best strategy regarding consumption of tobacco.
",
5236,1,," does the state need a mechanism to prevent tobacco consumption at all?
",
5237,0,," is the number of affected people and budget expanses better controlled by a ban or by other measures?
",
5238,0,,"this argument is built on the premise that a ban or higher taxation in practice will lead to less smokers , especially protecting the families of smokers and other non-smoking citizens from potential health risks and premature death .
",
5239,0,," smoking also has wider effects , not simply restricted to smokers themselves .
",
5240,0,," so-called ` passive smoking ' is becoming an important issue : in a smoke-filled environment , non-smokers are also exposed to the risks associated with tobacco .
",
5241,0,," especially when it comes to homes and families there is a high likelihood of `` passive smoking '' .
",
5242,0,," research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer , even if they do not use tobacco products .
",
5243,0,," recent research even shows , that according to the journal archives of pediatrics , children living in households of smokers are more prone to mental illness , depression and attention deficit disorder , adhd ,.
",
5244,0,," so because restrictions on smoking prevent harm risks to families of smokers and third parties we should highly regulate or ban them .
",
5245,0,," a ban or high restrictions is a good measure to diminish the effects of smoking in society , because unlike the spreading of information , which is usually done by schools / clubs , governmental restrictions or a total ban will ensure the access of measures to the whole population .
",
5246,0,," through a ban on advertisement or higher taxation those citizens not involved in active educational structures get educated about the problem .
",
5247,0,," studies on the ban of advertisements show that bans actually contribute great amounts to the reduction of smokers .
",
5248,0,," `` the tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug , '' said dr douglas bettcher , director of who 's tobacco free initiative .
",
5249,0,," `` but comprehensive advertising bans do work , reducing tobacco consumption by up to% in countries that have already taken this legislative step .
",
5250,0,," ``so because these measures can drastically decrease smoking when other measures have failed , the state is right to impose bans on advertisement , higher prices or any other measures .
",
5251,0,," there is little doubt that smoking tobacco is extremely harmful to the smoker 's health .
",
5252,0,," in the us , for example , research by the american cancer society suggests that tobacco causes up to 400,000 deaths each year1 - more than aids , alcohol , drug abuse , car crashes , murders , suicides , and fires combined .
",
5253,0,," world-wide somemillion people die from smoking each year2 - one every ten seconds - which estimates suggest will rise tomillion by.
",
5254,0,," smokers are up totimes more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers , and smoking can lead to a host of other health problems , including emphysema and heart disease .
",
5255,0,," in a democracy the people elect leaders and trust them with a term , where their duty is solely to look after the wellbeing of the country and its citizens .
",
5256,0,," the politicians , having the resources and time , are well equipped to make a better and more informed decision on activities dangerous to the individual , others and the society .
",
5257,0,," therefore one of the principles is , that elected representatives have to make sure their citizens get the best possible protection in society .
",
5258,0,," even if this infringes on some of their rights .
",
5259,0,," that is why taking hard drugs and breaking the speed limit are also illegal .
",
5260,0,," it would therefore be reasonable to ban smoking or limit with different means the usage of tobacco - an activity which kills millions of people each year .
",
5261,0,," precedent is that if a company produces food that is poisonous or a car that fails safety tests , the product is immediately taken off the market .
",
5262,0,," since all cigarettes and other tobacco products are poisonous and potentially lethal , they should all be taken off the market .
",
5263,0,," in short , smoking should be banned or very harshly regulated .
",
5264,1,,"health professionals agree that high levels of alcohol consumption are bad for individuals and society.
",
5265,1,," individuals who drink heavily may become alcoholics, dependent upon alcohol and unable to function effectively in society.
",
5266,1,," they are likely to suffer liver damage and other illnesses, and binge drinkers (those who drink a lot of alcohol at one time) put themselves at increased risk of potentially-fatal blood poisoning and accidents.
",
5267,1,," society also pays a heavy price through increased health-care costs to care for those damaged by alcohol, and through the higher rates of anti-social behavior (including domestic violence and drunk-driving) associated with heavy drinking.
",
5268,1,," such concerns have been around for generations, but in recent years problems associated with alcohol have been increasing in a number of societies.
",
5269,1,," the uk in particular is seen to have an alcohol problem, with binge drinking common among younger people (including those below the legal age of purchasing alcohol at 18)1.
",
5270,1,,"in order to address the health and public order problems associated with heavy drinking, there have been calls over the past few years for governments to set a minimum price for each unit of alcohol (a unit is roughly half a pint of beer, a small glass of wine, or a single measure of spirits, but this can vary greatly depending on the alcoholic strength of the specific drink)2.
",
5271,1,," this would force supermarkets and discount stores to increase the price of their cheapest drinks, preventing them from selling some at a loss in order to attract more trade3.
",
5272,1,,"some canadian provinces already have such a pricing policy, known there as social reference pricing, and a proposal to introduce this in scotland was seriously debated in the scottish parliament inbut ultimately failed to pass.
",
5273,1,," inthe new coalition government in the uk announced that it will set a minimum price per unit of alcohol in england and wales by banning the sale of alcohol below the cost of the excise rate and value added tax upon each bottle (currently aboutpence per unit for beer andpence per unit for spirits)4/5/6.
",
5274,1,,"this proposal has attracted both support and criticisms; some object to the whole idea, while health campaigners have pointed out that it would set the minimum price at such a low level that it will make almost no difference in practice to the cost of alcohol.
",
5275,1,," for an effective debate, it will probably be best for the proposition to propose setting a minimum price at a level that will genuinely affect the cost of much of the alcohol sold.
",
5276,0,," a variety of international studies have found that increasing the cost of alcohol reduces its consumption , along with the health and social harms associated with it .
",
5277,0,," in australia , after the introduction of a higher taxation towards alcohol , in 2008/2009 , the overall consumption of alcohol dropped by 1.5 per cent and the number of teen-alcohol drinkers dropped inyears from the introduction of the policy forper cent1 .
",
5278,0,," further on , a study conducted by the harvard school of public health concerning the relationship of price increases and drinking among college students shows , that `` students faced with a $increase above the $ 2.17 average price for a drink will bepercent less likely to make the transition from being an abstainer to a moderate drinker , or from being a moderate drinker to a heavy drinker . ''
",
5279,0,," this supports the theory that drinking can be prevented by a higher tax2 .
",
5280,0,," the proposition would not claim that this is the only government policy that should be pursued to reduce the harms associated with alcohol , but it is a vital measure alongside other policies such as education initiatives , programs to help alcoholics overcomes their addiction , proof-of-age schemes , etc, and unlike these , it has the advantage of being in itself a very cheap intervention ; there is not even the cost associated with collecting a tax .
",
5281,0,," it is the government 's responsibility to promote the health and wellbeing of its citizens .
",
5282,0,," taxpayers are forced to pay for the cost of alcohol related ill-health and anti-social behavior .
",
5283,0,," this is a waste of money that be being spent on other government priorities .
",
5284,0,," this is an effective policy to deal with this issue .
",
5285,0,," free markets suffer from externalities -- costs , such as pollution , that are created by only a few actors , but which everyone has to pay .
",
5286,0,," so our whole society pays for the harms resulting from the ridiculously cheap alcohol associated with below-cost marketing and aggressive promotions .
",
5287,0,," families suffer terribly when a husband , mother or son is an alcoholic or violent drinker .
",
5288,0,," residents suffer from the anti-social behavior and crime associated with binge-drinking .
",
5289,0,," business loses millions of productive days ' work each year ; according to the institute of alcoholic studies , each day around 200,000 british workers turn up to work hung over from the night before .
",
5290,0,," high proportions of hung over workers report problems such as lack of concentration and the inability to work at normal pace .
",
5291,0,," inthere was an attributable 1.2 billion pounds attributed to the loss in economy , in the uk , based only on alcohol attributed absence from work.
",
5292,0,," all of this impacts the society , by losing overall economic wealth , through loss of productivity , and having to pour money to alcoholics ' health treatments .
",
5293,0,," if these individuals in society do not want to stop with their activities , they should at least give back financially .
",
5294,0,," in the state of washington , we see that the state 's beer , soda and bottled water tax gave the state $million in revenue in, helping to close a $ 2.8 billion deficit .
",
5295,0,," california could raise around $ 1.4 billion a year with a marijuana tax.
",
5296,0,," if the people can not stop with their actions , they should reimburse others by paying a higher price for goods to reduce their harm to state finances this measure will be good for public houses and bars , licensed premises , which have been struggling in recent years in comparison to supermarkets and discount retailers , off-licenses , that can sell alcohol much more cheaply .
",
5297,0,," this is because they do not have the same overheads and can take advantage of economies of scale .
",
5298,0,," pubs often sell alcohol at rates that would be higher than any minimum price .
",
5299,0,," clubs and pubs which offer happy hours and other irresponsible drinks deals would be the only ones affected by this proposal1 .
",
5300,0,," not only are pubs community centers that help to bring people together , they also have a good record in promoting sensible drinking and reducing hazardous activities
",
5301,0,,"there are realistic ways a policy of denying healthcare access to smokers could be carried out .
",
5302,0,," insurance companies already ask lots of health-related questions , often including whether their client is a smoker , when assessing life insurance premiums .
",
5303,0,," in these cases , you are required to give details of your lifestyle by law .
",
5304,0,," of course , some people do not , however this is to be expected since no law is one hundred per cent effective .
",
5305,0,," sanctions exist to discourage dishonest behaviour .
",
5306,0,," a similar model could be put in place requiring a declaration of smoker status to the health authority .
",
5307,0,," indeed , many doctors already enquire about their patients ' smoking statuses on an informal basis .
",
5308,0,," it is also particularly hard to lie about being a smoker for two reasons .
",
5309,0,," first , other people inevitably see you smoking .
",
5310,0,," this means an abundance of witnesses in the case of a dispute , and thus a disincentive to lie .
",
5311,0,," second , people require doctors to undertake detailed examinations for treatment purposes , thereby allowing them to see obvious outward signs of smoking : tar deposits , tar in cough , yellowed fingernails , etc, smokers contribute a disproportionately large amount to the cost of healthcare .
",
5312,0,," they are a drain on resources .
",
5313,0,," in the uk it is estimated that up to 9,500 beds are blocked daily by smokers , and that up to eight million doctor consultations are required on their behalf each year .
",
5314,0,," a well-informed smoker , unable or unwilling to quit , might assume an increased risk for himself but he would also be indirectly increasing the likelihood of others being unable to access necessary healthcare and this is not fair .
",
5315,0,," allowing smokers to take scarce beds or organs needed for transplants - that could otherwise go to those suffering from genuine misfortunes - is an unjust allocation of resources .
",
5316,1,,"loosely speaking, ""smoking bans"" mean it is illegal in that country to smoke tobacco in workplaces and other public places, e.g., in hospitals or hotels, to prevent the health problems that can arise as a result of accidentally inhaling other people's cigarette smoke.
",
5317,1,," however, of the countries that have smoking bans, there is wide variation in what public places are actually included.
",
5318,1,," for example, smoking is banned in all restaurants in berlin, but in austria large establishments are allowed to have separate rooms for smokers1.
",
5319,1,," in japan, only some companies (like mcdonald's) ban smoking in their buildings2, whereas in china a ban introduced inmeans smoking is illegal in all enclosed public spaces3.
",
5320,1,,"as well as these differences between countries that do have smoking bans, there are some countries where there are not yet any restrictions on smoking in public places.
",
5321,1,," these countries include costa rica4 and jamaica5, where bans are still only in consideration.
",
5322,1,,"because of this variation across the globe, it is important to discuss the reasons for and against having smoking banned in public places, and what kinds of places should be included.
",
5323,0,," however, for simplicity's sake, this debate will discuss whether smoking should be banned in all enclosed public places.
",
5324,0,,"the universal declaration of human rights , a list of rights to which the united nations has declared that all human beings should be entitled , states that `` everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family ``.
",
5325,0,," more thanstudies carried out worldwide have found that people are at an increased risk of lung cancer if they work or live with somebody who smokes2 .
",
5326,0,," given these very serious health risks , it goes against people 's human rights to be exposed to second-hand smoke when they have not chosen to breathe it in .
",
5327,0,," to avoid this happening , smoking should be banned in public places , so that non-smokers can be sure that they will not have to breathe in second-hand smoke .
",
5328,0,," the health problems that smokers experience cost taxpayers , where healthcare is provided by the government , or the individual , for private healthcare , a lot of money .
",
5329,0,," decreasing the number of smokers -- as a result of a reduction in both `` social smokers '' , those who smoke when out with friends , and `` passive smokers '' , those who do not smoke themselves but are exposed to the second-hand smoke of others , -- will lead to a decrease in these healthcare costs .
",
5330,0,," this has been reported -- for example -- in arizona , where a study found that hospital admissions due to diagnoses for which there is evidence for a cause by smoking have decreased since the statewide smoking ban , and that costs have thus decreased .
",
5331,0,," not being able to smoke in public will make it more difficult for smokers to keep up with their habit .
",
5332,0,," for example , if they are no longer able to smoke in the pub , smokers would have to go outside -- possibly in the rain or other uncomfortable weather -- and be away from their non-smoking friends every time they wanted to have a cigarette .
",
5333,0,," so , a smoking ban would encourage smokers to smoke less frequently and maybe even give up .
",
5334,0,," this can be seen in countries already with smoking bans .
",
5335,0,," for example , a study in england found that in the nine months after the smoking ban was introduced , there was a 5.5 % fall in the number of smokers in the country , compared to the much lower fall of 1.6 % in the nine months before the ban .
",
5336,0,," this can only be a good thing , since giving up smoking decreases the risk of death , even for those suffering from early stage lung cancer .
",
5337,0,," a ban in all public places would be no more difficult to introduce than existing bans preventing smoking in only some public places .
",
5338,0,," as long as people are given plenty of notice of changes , as was done in airports in saudi arabia , and the rules are made clear and readily available1 there should be few difficulties in introducing this ban .
",
5339,1,,"anorexia nervosa (an) is an eating disorder defined as severe, self- inflicted starvation leading to body weight at least 15% below that expected for the individual’s sex and height and age.
",
5340,1,," according to the 10th edition of the international classification of diseases (icd-10) of the world health organization (who) an is a mental illness.
",
5341,1,," it should not be confused with bulimia nervosa (cycles of bingeing and vomiting or other compensatory behaviour) although these mental disorders have a lot in common and may occur in the same person both sequentially or concurrently.
",
5342,1,," body image disturbance is a symptom of an.
",
5343,1,," an is much more common in teenage girls and young women compared to male individuals and in other age groups, affecting up to 1% of female adolescents in industrialized countries (with money to spend on epidemiological field studies to acquire such knowledge about a- regarding the whole population - rather rare disorder).
",
5344,1,," however, it is a serious disorder with a high mortality between 5% and 18%, and especially considering the young age of those afflicted.
",
5345,1,," unrealistically slim media portrayals of the female body may increase the risk of developing an, patients who are dangerously thin are sometimes force-fed using a naso-gastric (through the nose) or transdermal duodenal tube (peg).
",
5346,1,," normally, medical treatment cannot be administered without the consent of the patient.
",
5347,1,," however, mentally ill patients may not have the mental capacity to make a choice.
",
5348,0,," despite this, medical ethics, pragmatics and human rights call the treatment into question.
",
5349,0,,"life is more important than dignity , many medical treatments are unpleasant or painful but they are necessary to preserve life .
",
5350,0,," without force feeding the anorectic patient will often die .
",
5351,0,," in australia aboutper cent of all anorexic children required hospital admission , fromcases , and of those ,per cent required tube feeding as a life-saving measure to manage starvation .
",
5352,0,," when a patient requires emergency treatment doctors should do what is necessary to save the patient 's life .
",
5353,0,," psychological problems can only be treated if the person is alive .
",
5354,0,," treatment for the psychological problem should be considered to go hand in hand with saving the patient 's life as in the b vs. croydon health authority where force feeding was ruled to be complemented the use of other methods to treat her psychiatric problems .
",
5355,0,," anorectic patients are typically treated under mental health legislation , e.g. the ukact .
",
5356,0,," they do not make a free choice because they are not rationally able to weigh up decisions and consequences , they ` feel ' fat when they obviously are not and are irrational as they are willing to starve themselves to the point of death when suicide is not their intent .
",
5357,0,," the patient is not `` capable of forming unimpaired and rational judgements concerning the consequences '' , british medical association.
",
5358,0,," there have been court cases that have confirmed that force feeding should be allowed when a patient is considered mentally ill .
",
5359,0,," for example the case of `` b vs. croydon health authority '' init was judged , that b , a borderline personality disorder patient , which involves suffering from an irresistible desire to inflict-self-harm , can be force fed , even though she did not give consent to the treatment .
",
5360,0,," the court explained that because she was not aware of the seriousness of her condition and she had found it difficult to break out of the cycle of self-punishment , she was deemed unfit to make decisions about her nutrition .
",
5361,0,," a healthier body weight is necessary to be able to treat the patient 's psychological problems .
",
5362,0,," studies in minnesota show that when normal volunteers were starved , they began to development anorectic patterns .
",
5363,0,," they over-estimated the sizes of their own faces by approximately% .
",
5364,0,," this shows the impact of starvation on the brain .
",
5365,0,," medical ethics say that a doctor has a responsibility to keep the patient alive to administer treatment .
",
5366,0,," in the uk diana pretty was denied the right to die by the house of lords even though she consistently requested it .
",
5367,0,," the israeli courts ordered the force - feeding of political hunger strikers arguing that in a conflict between life and dignity , life wins .
",
5368,0,," india prosecuted a physician who allowed a hunger striker to die .
",
5369,0,," the medical profession take their responsibility for life very seriously on a global level .
",
5370,0,,"sometimes we must accept those dangers , as they come in the course of necessary medical procedures .
",
5371,0,," but with elective surgery -- procedures people do n't need , but rather merely want -- the risks ca n't be justified .
",
5372,0,," these risks apply both to the surgery itself , and to the long term .
",
5373,0,," for example , leaking silicone breast implants have been a widespread problem and can lead to death .
",
5374,0,," silicone gel can leak from the implant into healthy breast tissue and go other parts of your body , such as the lungs and lymph nodes , where it could be impossible to remove.
",
5375,0,,"studies published inby scientists at the national cancer institute raised questions about the long-term safety of breast implants .
",
5376,0,," one study found that women who had breast implants for at least eight years were twice as likely to die from brain cancer , three times as likely to die from lung cancer or other respiratory diseases , and four times as likely to commit suicide , compared to other plastic surgery patientsa second study found that women with breast implants for at least eight years were% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to other women their age .
",
5377,0,," there is also the risk that the person having the surgery will be dissatisfied with the results .
",
5378,0,," only those that can pay for it get it .
",
5379,0,," the most popular surgeries include breast augmentation , liposuction , nasal surgery , eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty .
",
5380,0,," there surgeries cost between # 3,000 and #, between # 2,500 and # 6,000 , between # 3,500 and # 4,000 and between # 2,000 to # 6,000 respectively .
",
5381,0,," so if it has the advantages the opposition claims , the rich will look good , and the poor will not .
",
5382,0,," there is considerable evidence that women 's attractiveness is judged more harshly than men 's .
",
5383,0,," for example , in a study by adams and huston  participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of photographs of people of varying ages .
",
5384,0,," they found that although attractiveness ratings of both men and women declined with age , the rate of decline for women was greater .
",
5385,0,," researchers report that women 's magazines have ten and one-half times more ads and articles promoting weight loss than men 's magazines do , and over three-quarters of the covers of women 's magazines include at least one message about how to change a woman 's bodily appearance -- by diet , exercise or cosmetic surgery .
",
5386,0,," these views about appearance are damaging because it leads to seriously unhealthy lifestyles that women think they need to look beautiful .
",
5387,0,," for example , in, teen magazine reported thatper cent of girlstoyears old have been on at least one diet , and thattoper cent of normal weight girls believe they are overweight .
",
5388,0,," cosmetic surgery sends the message that the prejudices some have about appearance are valid .
",
5389,1,,"transcanada keystone pipeline filed an application infor a presidential permit with the department of state to build and operate the keystone xl project.
",
5390,1,,"the proposed keystone xl project would consist of a 1,700-mile crude oil pipeline and related facilities that would be used largely to transport western canadian sedimentary basin crude oil from an oil supply hub in alberta, canada to delivery points in oklahoma and texas.
",
5391,1,," the project would also be capable of transporting u.s. crude from places like north dakota and montana to those delivery points.
",
5392,1,," the project could transport up to 830,000 barrels per day and is estimated to cost $7 billion.
",
5393,1,," if permitted, it would begin operation in 2013, with the actual date dependant on the necessary permits, approvals, and authorizations.
",
5394,1,," the project has generated significant debate in the united states regarding the extraction and use of oil from alberta's tar sands, which generally results in greater environmental issues and greenhouse gas emissions than conventional reservoir extraction.
",
5395,1,," pipelines are also fairly vulnerable to spills.
",
5396,1,," but, supporters argue it will create 100,000 jobs and strengthen us energy independence from sources in unstable and unfriendly regions of the world.
",
5397,1,,"since the application was filed, the project has followed a confused bureaucratic path.
",
5398,1,," favoured by national republicans and pennsylvania democrats as well as labor unions, it has been opposed by the obama administration which held up approval of the project through the fall of 2011.
",
5399,1,," as of december of 2011, congressional republicans were looking to attach a bill approving the project to an extension of the payroll tax cut.
",
5400,1,," on the 18th januarythe state department denied the keystone xl pipeline a permit saying it had not had time to review the plans but at the same time the transcanada is allowed to resubmit the proposal with route changes.
",
5401,0,," currently , the united states imports nearly two-thirds of its petroleum , with the leading suppliers including nations such as nigeria , venezuela and saudi arabia .
",
5402,0,," due to political instability and the difficult us relations with these nations , us supplies can not be considered secure , and with the results of research into alternative sources of energy being decades away from fruition the united states needs alternative sources of oil today .
",
5403,0,," one option is canada , which is individually already the united states ' single largest energy supplier .
",
5404,0,," canada 's known reserves totalbillion barrels , placing it third behind saudi arabia , but some estimates have put its total at as high astrillion barrels .
",
5405,0,," the xl pipeline project would help bring this oil overland into the united states .
",
5406,0,," on the canadian end , the increased market access would lead to rapid development , which in turn would increase canadian capacity to the level to which it could reach a much greater portion of us demand .
",
5407,0,," furthermore , the united states enjoys close relations and an open border with canada , meaning that this oil will likely arrive without the strings attached that come from buying from venezuela or the middle east .
",
5408,0,," in the case of the latter the pipeline would allow the us to disengage from the region to a degree .
",
5409,0,," even if hypothetically canadian relations were to turn frosty , the existence of the pipeline would nevertheless ensure that the us would remain the only viable market .
",
5410,0,," the xl pipeline project has the potential to create a large number of jobs , both in its construction , and in refining and processing at its terminal points within the united states .
",
5411,0,," keystone pipelines has produced a report which indicates that the pipeline should create 118,000 jobs , with as many as 250,000 in total after spinoffs have been counted .
",
5412,0,," labor unions have accepted this line and are aggressively lobbying for the pipeline , even though it means siding with republicans and against their own party .
",
5413,0,," furthermore , politicians ranging from jon huntsman to bob casey have embraced the job-creating p  otential of the project .
",
5414,0,," canada 's oil reserves will be of major strategic value in the next century .
",
5415,0,," currently the united states is canada 's preferred trading partner and strategic ally , both because of a history of past cooperation , and because the us is both more willing and able to support canadian claims to the arctic than china .
",
5416,0,," the pipeline would consolidate this relationship , ensuring that the development of canada 's reserves would occur with the american market in mind , because once built , it would be far more expensive to build a second pipeline than to simply use the existing one .
",
5417,0,," the united states , is not however , canada 's only option .
",
5418,0,," canada is determined to sell the oil one way or another , and an american refusal will not save the environment .
",
5419,0,," what it will do is make canada look elsewhere .
",
5420,0,," the canadian government publicly floated a joint-canadian-chinese pipeline proposal which would bring the oil to the pacific after the obama administration delayed consideration of the project until after.
",
5421,0,," just as the keystone pipeline would lock canada into the us market , a decision to develop canadian reserves with the chinese market in mind would be difficult to reverse , and undermine the energy independence of the united states rather than secure it .
",
5422,1,,"detention on the grounds of mental health aims to provide treatment and safety for those who are deemed unable to make an informed decision about their situation due to their mental state.
",
5423,1,," the current process in the uk means that two doctors or a doctor and a social worker have to declare that it would be in the interest of the patient and society for the patient to be 'sectioned' (meaning detained in hospital).
",
5424,1,," this usually lasts forhours, but can be extended by the doctor for up todays (full details in scrapbook).
",
5425,1,," a similar process is carried out in countries such as australia, the usa (although the specifics vary between states) and the netherlands.
",
5426,1,," in other countries such as germany, detention is only carried out if a guardian wishes it.
",
5427,1,," yet historically, such a method of detention has been abused by governments such as soviet russia using these mental health laws to detain political prisoners1.
",
5428,1,," many mental health awareness groups oppose this policy.
",
5429,0,," this aims to discuss the positive and negative aspects and effects of detention on the grounds of mental illness, with particular reference to dspd (dangerous severe personality disorder).
",
5430,0,,"as a society we should put effort into helping those suffering from mental illness and detention is one way of being sure that they are receiving and maintain treatment .
",
5431,0,," this also means that doctors are able to keep an eye on patients so that if the patient is no longer a risk , they can be let out .
",
5432,0,," if patients are detained then doctors will have a better idea of their patient 's usual behaviour and therefore be better at reading their symptoms .
",
5433,0,," the public is at risk from people with known dangerous mental health problems .
",
5434,0,," two people are killed every month by care in the community patients in the uk , care in the community described in scrapbook .
",
5435,0,," jonathan zito was stabbed to death by christopher clunis in; jason mitchell beheaded his father and strangled two pensioners in; stephen laudat killed his grandfather in, believing him to be the gang leader ronnie kray ; john rous stabbed care worker jonathan newby to death in; michael stone killed lin and megan russell in a field near their home in.
",
5436,0,," all of these killers had diagnosed mental illnesses but could not be detained under uk law , yet if they had been detained many lives would have been saved .
",
5437,0,," currently , people with mental health problems who have not committed an offence may only be detained for the purposes of treatment , and may avoid treatment if they can argue that they will receive no benefit from it .
",
5438,0,," there is no known effective treatment for dangerous severe personality disorder , dspd .
",
5439,0,," this means that people with dspd fall through a gap between the criminal justice system and the healthcare system -- they can not be treated , so they never get less dangerous , but they can not be detained , so the public can not be protected from them .
",
5440,0,," furthermore it seems it is not unreasonable to detain people who you have good grounds to suspect could be dangerous as we already detain potentially dangerous people who do not have mental health problems anyway , if authorities believe they may be terrorists .
",
5441,0,," people who are mentally ill are significantly more of a danger to themselves than to others with only% of homicides being committed by people with mental illness .1 detention is one way of preventing people suffering from mental illness to harm themselves or anyone else , and this must be in the best interest of the patient .
",
5442,0,," some people who are mentally unwell may attempt to commit suicide or get caught up in a cycle of self deprecating thoughts .
",
5443,0,," however , patients in detention can be monitored ; therefore similarly to the issue of argument one , it seems important to detain patients in order to save them from themselves .
",
5444,0,," thebritish mental health act1 was actually created partly in order to update the mental health actso that it conforms to current human rights law .
",
5445,0,," the process of sectioning ensures this by having two separate doctors diagnose the patient as both mentally ill and a threat to themselves or others ; these diagnoses are then presented to an independent amp , approved medical practitioner , who makes the decision about whether or not the individual can be detained .
",
5446,0,," if a doctor or amp believes this should be extended todays , then the process is repeated again independently .
",
5447,0,," therefore they should be no concerns about these detentions violating anyone 's human rights .
",
5448,1,,"alcohol has been part of the culture of recreation for thousands of years, it is also a dangerous substance.
",
5449,1,," as such, almost all countries place an age restriction on it.
",
5450,1,," the few exceptions where there is no minimum drinking age include albania, vietnam and cambodia.
",
5451,1,," while the us and uk have comparatively high drinking ages ofandrespectively, some european countries allow drinking at a younger age; usually around(at least for beer, if not for spirits).
",
5452,1,," the purpose of a minimum drinking age is to act as a deterrent from drinking alcohol, as young people face legal punishment if they break the law by drinking underage.
",
5453,1,," supposedly, this deterrent helps to preserve the overall health and safety of young people until they reach an age where they are considered responsible enough to regulate their own drinking.
",
5454,1,,"    however, underage drinking remains a problem.
",
5455,1,," the law is often difficult to enforce if people drink in their own homes, rather than in a public place.
",
5456,1,," though establishments such as bars or supermarkets often have a policy to ask for identification when selling alcohol in the uk, levels of sales to minors are still not considered to be low enough.
",
5457,1,," so far, the minimum drinking age in the uk and the us has failed to stop some minors from obtaining alcohol.
",
5458,1,,"            the mechanism for this debate is simple: passing a law to change the legal drinking age.
",
5459,1,," for the us, this could be changing fromto 18; for the uk, fromto 16; for other european countries, considering thatis now a common drinking age,would also be suitable here.
",
5460,1,," in any of these particular settings, the principle arguments remain the same.
",
5461,1,,"            the proposition might also choose to tie in extra conditions to the mechanism, for example raising tax on harder forms of alcohol like spirits, or on youth-targeted alcoholic drinks like alcopops, to deter excessive drinking by young people after the law is passed.
",
5462,1,," studies have also found that higher taxes on alcohol can noticeably reduce the number of accidents and violent incidents.
",
5463,1,," another mechanism tie-in would be to state that tax money gained from the sale of alcohol to young people who can now legally drink will be funded back into educational schemes to promote responsible drinking, or in worst case to cover the costs of medical treatment or criminal damage committed.
",
5464,1,," it may be useful to point out the analogy to smoking.
",
5465,1,," though smoking results in a lot of medical conditions (and a hefty economic strain on the nhs in the uk), the tax money from cigarettes ‘more than pays for’ the cost of healthcare for people who get cancer from smoking.
",
5466,0,," by imposing a high drinking age in the us and the uk , illegal drinking is seen as even more attractive because it is exclusive .
",
5467,0,," for many teenagers , underage drinking is seen as a way to gain respect from their peers and appear ` cool ' , or to feel ` more at ease in social situations ' .
",
5468,0,," the very fact that it is illegal makes it a target for teenagers to gain social status by drinking , as is true for other illegal substances such as marijuana .
",
5469,0,," because it is harder to get , when young people do manage to obtain alcohol they tend to have high rates of binge-drinking .
",
5470,0,," lowering the drinking age would remove this illicit appeal and encourage people to drink more moderately when they do drink .
",
5471,0,," if the drinking age were lowered , the perceived ` need ' to binge drink would be removed too .
",
5472,0,," asurvey showed that , in the us , there was a higher rate of binge drinking among high school students , 41.8 % , who reported current alcohol use than among adults where , even in high-risk categories , binge-drinking rates did not rise above 25.6 % .
",
5473,0,," limited alcohol consumption can actually be beneficial for a person 's health , and is linked to ` a lower risk of coronary heart disease in healthy men and women ' .
",
5474,0,," the drinking age should be lowered to remove the glamorisation of alcohol and resultant binge drinking , and instead focus on frequent but moderate alcohol consumption .
",
5475,0,," while the current drinking age isin the uk andin the us , both countries grant other legal rights to people below this age .
",
5476,0,," for example , both countries grant the right to have sex or join the army at a lower age than this .
",
5477,0,," this recognition of maturity should also encompass the right to drink ; if young people are responsible enough to fight for their country or have sex , they should be responsible enough to have a drink .
",
5478,0,," in any case , studies show that many underage young people have tried alcohol ; it is clear that the current legal restrictions do not work .
",
5479,0,," surveys at east carolina university in the us found that when the drinking age was raised fromto,% of students reported that they ` intended to use other drugs ' as drinking became illegal for people of their age .
",
5480,0,," meanwhile , in arizona , surveys before and after the drinking age was raised fromtofound no reduction in alcohol consumption among their students .
",
5481,0,," raising the drinking age , therefore , does not necessarily mean a reduction in alcohol consumption , and more worryingly could push people towards other substances which are dangerous and difficult to regulate or police .
",
5482,0,," the legal system should acknowledge high rates of underage drinking and change to reflect the reality of drinking patterns .
",
5483,1,,"according to the who, inthere were approximately 2.25 million premature deaths worldwide linked to alcohol.
",
5484,1,," alcohol is responsible for 4.5% of the global disease burden, even after the protective effects of low and moderate alcohol consumption had been considered.
",
5485,1,," furthermore, binge drinking (excessive alcohol consumption) is becoming an increasing problem in most countries.
",
5486,1,,"in almost all countries in the world, adults are allowed to buy and consume alcohol with very little restriction (although there are often laws about the exact hours that bars and shops are allowed to sell alcohol and laws against drinking and driving).
",
5487,1,," this is in marked contrast to the legal situation with regard to other mind-altering (or ‘psycho-active’) drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, acid, and heroin.
",
5488,1,," the first question this offers is whether alcohol and other drugs should be treated the same?
",
5489,1,," how do you make a difference?
",
5490,1,," further on the question is also, what is an effective policy regarding alcohol consumption.
",
5491,1,," is it higher prices or the ultimate “ban” approach?
",
5492,1,,"currently a few islamic countries have the ban imposed, these are saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, the united arab emirates, iran and the gaza.
",
5493,1,," inalso the “liberal arabic country” bahrain has started a debate about banning alcohol.
",
5494,1,,"in the past, the experience of ‘prohibition’ in the usa in the 1920s and 1930s, when there was a huge black market in alcohol run by a powerful criminal underworld, makes most people very wary of trying to ban alcohol and equalize it with other drugs.
",
5495,1,,"some countries use a total ban on all types of alcohol; this also includes beer, wine as well as stronger liquor.
",
5496,1,," other countries (due to tourism and investment) have a special license for foreigners as the state connects the ban mainly to their islamic heritage.
",
5497,1,,"is it time to try to solve the alcohol problem through more restrictions and campaigns or is it time for a ban policy?
",
5498,0,,"  alcohol is a mind altering drug , which can cause individuals to take actions they would have not done otherwise .
",
5499,0,," this does not refer to loosened inhibitions , but also extends to harmful acts against themselves and others .
",
5500,0,," democracy is based on the principle that the majority of people are to elect leaders and trust them with a term , where their duty is solely to look after the wellbeing of the country and its citizens .
",
5501,0,," the politicians , having the resources and time which they have to use , to get well equipped to make more informed decision on activities dangerous to the individual , others and the society .
",
5502,0,," one of the principles in society therefore is that elected representatives have to make sure their citizens get the best possible protection in society .
",
5503,0,," even if this infringes on some of their rights .
",
5504,0,," alcohol for a long time has been kept because the government trusted the people ; they would make responsible decisions regarding alcohol .
",
5505,0,," however , each year , the society loses , on ayear based average , more than 75,000 individuals to alcohol related diseases or accidents .
",
5506,0,," thus the citizens proved not to be responsible ; even though they had information available they did not make the choice that would keep them alive .
",
5507,0,," the government has a duty to protect those irresponsible citizens , because otherwise they will not be able to contribute to society to the extent they could without alcohol .
",
5508,0,," and because the government does not know who is the one that will make a stupid decision that will engender their lives in the long run , for the sake of few individuals ' , alcohol has to be banned for all .
",
5509,0,," therefore , because the government has been trusted with the duty to make informed decisions instead of the individuals and to protect the individual , it is right to allow them to ban alcohol if they believe it is very harmful .
",
5510,0,," alcohol is a contributory factor to a huge proportion of disputes and distress in society .
",
5511,0,," it also contributes to the psychological problems of the alcohol consumer children .
",
5512,0,," while the problem might not be connected to one individual in society , it is important that laws protect those , who might abuse their rights and with this hurt others .
",
5513,0,," currently in the us alone , there is an estimated 6.6 million children under, which live in households with at least one alcoholic parent .
",
5514,0,," it was never the fault of these children that others started to drink and harm them .
",
5515,0,," according to psychological studies many of the children coming from alcohol abuse families have problems such as low self-esteem , loneliness , guilt , feelings of helplessness , fears of abandonment , and chronic depression .
",
5516,0,," children of alcoholics in some cases even feel responsible for the problems of the alcoholic and may think they created the problem .
",
5517,0,," alcohol is also a great contributor not only to psychological , but also to physical damage .
",
5518,0,," many times , alcohol is an easy excuse for domestic abusers .
",
5519,0,," the incidence of domestic abuse in households , where there is alcohol abuse is a lot higher and the abusers name the effects of alcohol as their main cause of violence .
",
5520,0,," with taking away alcohol we take away the fuel of many of the abusers , thus protecting third involved parties .
",
5521,0,," a ban of alcohol would have a great impact on the health of every individual .
",
5522,0,," alcohol and especially alcohol abuse are very common problems in today 's society .
",
5523,0,," long lasting abuse of substances leads to many chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis , damage to liver cells , ; pancreatitis , inflammation of the pancreas , ; various cancers , including liver , mouth , throat , larynx , the voice box , and esophagus ; high blood pressure ; and psychological disorders .
",
5524,0,," with a ban of alcohol we would very much lower the rates of consumption , as already current drug laws show .
",
5525,0,," even though drugs have a similar effect as alcohol , because of the risk of consequences when using those substances .
",
5526,0,," therefore in general the number of alcohol addiction would sink and cause also less of a financial health burden .
",
5527,0,," according to the us alone , the economic cost of alcohol abuse inwas 184.6 billion dollars .
",
5528,0,," this is a burden which many state budgets have to bear .
",
5529,0,," therefore if this cost can be prevented , the lives of people improved , by not getting the chronic diseases , we should do so .
",
5530,1,,"ivf (in vitro fertilization) treatment is a medical procedure to assist infertile (or otherwise unable) couples to conceive children.
",
5531,1,," the process involves fertilizing egg cells with sperm outside of the womb (in vitro), and then transferring the fertilized egg (zygote) into either the biological mother’s womb, or the womb of a surrogate.
",
5532,1,," babies conceived through ivf are colloquially known as ‘test tube babies’.
",
5533,1,," pregnancy rates are around 35% (although this varies a lot between clinics), which means that many couples need to go through several ‘cycles’ of treatment before successfully conceiving – this is one of the reasons why costs are so high.
",
5534,1,," prices for one cycle of treatment range from around $4000 in japan to $12,500 in the usa.
",
5535,1,," the overall cost per live birth ranges from $40,000 in the usa and the uk to $24,500 in scandinavia and japan.
",
5536,1,," some countries (e.g. belgium, sweden, australia and israel) provide funding for several cycles of ivf, while the uk’s nhs provides funding for just one cycle.
",
5537,1,," countries, which have currently implemented the policy of public funding, have strict regulations regarding for those desiring publicly funded ivf.
",
5538,1,," usually there are publicly funded consultations and publicly funded treatments.
",
5539,1,,"  in new zealand, the duration of infertility has to be at least one year and it has to be known to doctors that there is a severe cause for the infertility.
",
5540,1,," also in auckland specific eligibility criteria are that the woman has to be less thanyears old at referral, is not obese and has not been smoking for at leastmonths before the treatment.
",
5541,1,," similar policies, which will be eligible for public funding, could also be implemented in other countries.
",
5542,1,,"  the debate can be set up by the proposition as providing one or more cycles as part of a national health service (so the state actually provides the treatment), or as the state subsidizing patients to receive the treatment privately.
",
5543,1,," countries, which have currently implemented the policy of public funding, have strict regulations regarding for those desiring publicly funded ivf.
",
5544,1,," usually there are publicly funded consultations and publicly funded treatments.
",
5545,1,,"  in new zealand, the duration of infertility has to be at least one year and it has to be known to doctors that there is a severe cause for the infertility.
",
5546,1,," also in auckland specific eligibility criteria are that the woman has to be less thanyears old at referral, is not obese and has not been smoking for at leastmonths before the treatment.
",
5547,1,," similar policies, which will be eligible for public funding, could also be implemented in other countries.
",
5548,0,,"  having children is such an important aspect of most people 's lives that it should be considered a right .
",
5549,0,," for many people , their status as parents is a key part of their identity , and their devotion towards their children is indicative of how important parenting is to them .
",
5550,0,," the right to start a family is recognized in articleof the european convention on human rights and articleof the universal declaration of human rights .
",
5551,0,," however , this right is apportioned unevenly .
",
5552,0,," couples who are unable to have children naturally , either because of medical infertility or because they are a same-sex couple , are unable to conceive children unless they are wealthy enough to afford private ivf treatment .
",
5553,0,," this may affect many people given the extremely high cost of ivf treatment .
",
5554,0,," being unable to exercise this right should not depend on income , so the state must financially assist couples who are unable to afford treatment .
",
5555,0,," and even if we believe this right is not basic , and more a choice of a lifestyle , if the state has the possibility to ensure it to everyone , why not maximize rights and make as many people happy as possible .
",
5556,0,," if the state funded ivf treatment , it would overcome some of the inefficiencies involved in expensive medical treatment .
",
5557,0,," costs would be brought down as economies of scale are exploited , and state health services have better bargaining power when it comes to purchasing large orders of drugs and equipment .
",
5558,0,," a higher rate of treatment within the population would increase safety and improve outcomes , thus reducing costs , as medical departments become more experienced .
",
5559,0,," most significantly , an asymmetry of information exists between doctor and patient , as it does with all medical treatment , -- patients are not aware of what services they need , and are unable to weigh up the various options available to them , because doing so requires medical training .
",
5560,0,," this drives up prices , as doctors have incentives to ` over treat ' patients , and not to treat patients in the most cost-effective manner .
",
5561,0,," providing state funding would make the state the purchaser of ivf services , or even the direct provider of them , removing either the ability to over treat or the incentive to do so , depending on whether the state is the buyer or the provider .
",
5562,0,," most couples which decide to do ivf treatments do not have unlimited funds available to them .
",
5563,0,," therefore , once they decide to do ivf treatments in order to reduce the costs of more cycles , couples and clinicians , with only private funds , typically opt to implant numerous embryos , hoping at least one will survive .
",
5564,0,," while this may reduce the cost of treatments , it can result in `` multiples '' -- anything from twins to the infamous `` octomom '' octoplets .
",
5565,0,," multiples tend to be born prematurely and have a high rate of health problems , which can result in tremendous medical costs and life-long expenses , such as special education .
",
5566,0,," through the ivf treatments the early numbers in quebec show , only 3.8 per cent of pregnancies in the ivf program are now multiples , down sharply from 27.2 per cent.
",
5567,0,,"so with the public funding , two benefits are safer treatment of mother and child , since only one implant at a time gets implanted , and reduced cost of ivf treatment for parents .
",
5568,0,," there are benefits to the state in promoting fertility treatments and so encouraging more people to have children .
",
5569,0,," most developed countries have rapidly aging populations with too few young people to be able to maintain their pensions systems over the next thirty years .
",
5570,0,," to avert demographic crisis governments need to do more to encourage couples to start families .
",
5571,0,," many states already support couples who have children through the benefits system ; some like italy even pay a lump sum to couples on the birth of each child .
",
5572,0,," funding ivf to increase the number of births is an obvious extension of this principle .
",
5573,0,," it would also be right for society through the state to fund ivf , as career expectations and the high costs of housing force many couples now delay starting a family until they are in their thirties , by which time they may need medical help to conceive .
",
5574,1,,"the who reports that “in1.5 billion adults,and older, were overweight with a body mass index (a proxy measurement of body fat based on height and weight) overand that of these 1.5 billion overweight adults, overmillion men and nearlymillion women were obese (bmi > 30).
",
5575,1,," overall, more than one in ten of the world’s adult population was reported to be obese.
",
5576,1,," once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings.
",
5577,1,," close tomillion overweight children are living in developing countries andmillion in developed countries.”
",
5578,1,,"the who notes that “overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths.
",
5579,1,," at least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.
",
5580,1,," in addition, 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the ischemic heart disease burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to overweight and obesity.”
",
5581,1,,"since one of the factors that contributes to obesity is the inordinate amount of calories consumed, and given the fact that fats have more than twice as much calories (9 kcal/g) than protein and carbohydrates (4 kcal/g) on a gram basis, could introducing disincentives to fat consumption curb the obesity epidemic?
",
5582,1,,"we would implement a flat tax on food items high (in excess of 20% of the daily requirements) on saturated fats, salt and sugar.
",
5583,1,," hungary did that and introduced a flat tax on foods high in fat, sugar and salt in the amount of 10 forint (0.037 eur) on the 1st of september.
",
5584,1,," denmark did something similar on the 1st of october, charging 16 dkk (2.15 eur) per kg of saturated fat on domestic and imported food, not including products with saturated fat content fewer than 2.3%.
",
5585,1,," there are similar initiatives and proposals in other eu countries as well, as well as overseas in the us.
",
5586,0,," the obesity epidemic is taking an enormous toll on global medical costs .
",
5587,0,," in the us alone the health care costs attributable to either direct or indirect consequences of obesity have been estimated at $ 147bn .
",
5588,0,," put into context , this amounts to roughly% of the health spending in the us .
",
5589,0,," the figure might seem excessive , but we need to remember that obesity is linked to typediabetes , several kinds of cancer , coronary artery disease , stroke , congestive heart failure , asthma , chronic back pain and hypertension , to name just a few .
",
5590,0,," we also need to realize that many of the diseases on this list are chronic in nature , requiring lifelong pharmacological therapy , which often follows complex and expensive diagnostic procedures , frequent medical specialist consultations , and not infrequent emergency interventions .
",
5591,0,," adding to the list is the value of income lost due to decreased productivity , restricted activity , and absenteeism , not to mention the value of future income lost by premature death .
",
5592,0,," thus it becomes increasingly clear that due to the substantial cost obesity presents to the society , individual choices that might lead to excessive weight gain , can no longer be considered as solely individual in nature .
",
5593,0,," therefore the government is legitimate in its action to introduce a form of a fat tax in order to try to dissuade the population from becoming obese and cover the increasing societal costs the already obese individuals are responsible for .
",
5594,0,," a sin tax is a term often used for fees tacked on to popular vices like drinking , gambling and smoking .
",
5595,0,," its roots have been traced back to the 16th century vatican , where pope leo x taxed licensed prostitutes .
",
5596,0,," more recently , and with greater success , us federal cigarette taxes were shown to have reduced consumption by% for every% increase in the price of cigarettes .
",
5597,0,," given the success achieved with uprooting this societal vice , which on a number of counts is similar to the unhealthy food one - immense health costs linked to a choice to consume a product -- we should employ this tried and true strategy to combat the obesity epidemic .
",
5598,0,," in fact , a recent study published in the archives of internal medicine followedpeople foryears , tracking food consumption and various biological metrics .
",
5599,0,," the report states that `` researchers found that , incremental increases in price of unhealthy foods resulted in incremental decreases in consumption .
",
5600,0,," in other words , when junk food cost more , people ate it less . ''
",
5601,0,," thus leaning on the successful tradition of existing `` sin '' taxes and research that points out the potential for success of a similar solution in this arena , it should be concluded that a fat tax is an important part of a sensible and effective solution to the obesity epidemic .
",
5602,0,," an important reason why people continuously turn to unhealthy , fat , sugar and salt laden food , is the simple fact that it 's often cheaper than a more wholesome meal comprised at least in part of fresh produce .
",
5603,0,," a study done at the university of washington found that `` when they compared the prices offoods ... junk foods not only cost less ... but junk food prices are also less likely to rise as a result of inflation . ''
",
5604,0,," a similar conclusion was reached by a group of australian researchers , who found that the prices of healthy food have risenper cent above inflation , while the harmful counterpart have actually dropped below inflation -- as much asper cent below .
",
5605,0,," noting that obesity is more prevalent in groups of lower socioeconomic status , we find that the price of food is a substantial incentive for consumption .
",
5606,0,," thus it is only reasonable to levy a tax against unhealthy , fatty food in order to give healthy food a fighting chance .
",
5607,1,,"aboutper cent of the men in the world are circumcised – normally shortly after birth.
",
5608,1,," this raises issues ranging from the purely ethical to the purely scientific; with quite a lot in between that is a hybrid of the two.
",
5609,1,," although defenders of the practice claim that there are medical benefits – up to and including the prevention of aids – opponents see it as an unnecessary procedure that causes pain to an infant for no apparent benefit.
",
5610,1,,"clearly there are also issues of the balance between religious freedom.
",
5611,1,,"percent of the male circumcisions in the world are performed on muslims, with members of the other abrahamic faiths making up much to the rest.
",
5612,1,," there is also an issue of whether parents have the right to make such a decision, one that is effectively irreversible, on behalf of their child when they are at an age when they are incapable of giving consent.
",
5613,1,,"national and international medical bodies have mostly taken an agnostic position on the subject, acknowledging that there may be medical benefits but, ultimately, accepting that it is a matter of parental choice.
",
5614,1,,"circumcision became common practice in the us aroundand has been in relatively common practice for non-religious reasons in various countries.
",
5615,1,," however, it is interesting that in situations where governments are required to pay for it, they tend not to.
",
5616,0,," consider society 's reaction if the fingers of unwilling adults were forcibly removed .
",
5617,0,," what about unwilling children ?
",
5618,0,," what about the fingers of babies fresh out of the womb ?
",
5619,0,," the only sane response to such an action would be condemnation -- and probably an arrest .
",
5620,0,," the logic of this argument does not change if `` finger '' is replaced with `` foreskin '' .
",
5621,0,," although the report suggest a correlation with a reduction in the possibility in the spread of aids in sub-saharan africa it also comments , `` if correctly planned , increased provision of accessible , safe adult male circumcision services could also increase opportunities to educate men in areas of high hiv prevalence about a variety of sexual and reproductive health topics , including hygiene , sexuality , gender relations and the need for ongoing combination prevention strategies to further decrease risk of hiv acquisition and transmission . ''
",
5622,0,," out with this area the rate of adult male circumcision is very low , suggesting that when the individual is of an age to give consent , they chose not to .
",
5623,0,," performing an act on a child that would not be consented to by an adult except in extremis would seem a fairly reasonable definition of child abuse .
",
5624,0,," a report by the royal dutch medical association noted that there was not a single medical body in the world that could point , categorically to a medical need for circumcision of infants .
",
5625,0,," it further concluded that `` the fact that this practice is not medically necessary and entails a genuine risk of complications means that extra-stringent requirements must be established with regard to this type of information and advice . ''
",
5626,0,," yet this is a practice that is performed around the world by people with little or no medical training and accepted by parents as an instruction from god .
",
5627,0,," any risk needs to be justified against some benefit .
",
5628,0,," in the absence of any demonstrable benefit then there is no need to tolerate any risk , particularly in the case of a newborn baby who can not express his opinion one way or another and will not be able to do so for years to come .
",
5629,1,,"trans fat is the common name for unsaturated fat with trans-isomer (e-isomer) fatty acid(s).
",
5630,1,," it can be found in oreos, cup-cakes, french fries, deep-fried dishes, croissants, and other foods.
",
5631,1,," it is so unhealthy for individuals that many legislators have proposed and executed bans on the use of trans fats in restaurants, and in some cases in commercially available grocery goods and foodstuffs as well.
",
5632,1,,"new york city was the first us city to have successfully banned trans fats in december of 2006.
",
5633,1,," philadelphia followed in october of 2007.
",
5634,1,," san francisco, seattle, and chicago have all passed similar bans or limitations since.
",
5635,1,," many other legislatures in the us are pursuing bans.
",
5636,1,," denmark was the first country to effectively ban trans fats in 2003, with switzerland following in 2009.
",
5637,1,," the debate continues in many other countries and localities.
",
5638,1,,"while many believe that the world might be healthier without the trans-isomer fats, others contend that trans fats have a particularly delicious taste, and serve the functional purpose of extending the shelf-life of foods.
",
5639,1,," opponents of a ban also criticize efforts by the government to protect consumers by limiting their choices, calling this ""infantilization"" and ""nannying.""
",
5640,1,," but supporters respond that trans fats are so widespread in restaurants and products (often without labelling) that consumers really don't have an informed ""choice"" in consuming the fat.
",
5641,0,," and while many argue that banning trans fats is like trying to ban tobacco or alcohol, supporters respond that trans fats are only an ingredient (not a whole product category) for which there are replacement ingredients that can maintain the taste and quality of the final food products.
",
5642,0,,"trans fats , which are chemically engineered , decrease levels of desirable cholesterol while increasing harmful cholesterol ; they increase dangerous inflammation that can contribute to the onset of diabetes ; and they harden artery walls , which increases blood pressure .
",
5643,0,," trans fats are much worse than even naturally occurring , and still very unhealthy , saturated fats such as those found in butter .
",
5644,0,," dariush mozaffarian , a harvard cardiologist and epidemiologist , calculated that up topercent of heart attacks in the united states are the result of trans fat consumption .
",
5645,0,,"  banning trans fats would therefore mean saving thousands of lives and improving the general health of hundreds of thousands of individuals .
",
5646,0,," in england , for example , aper cent reduction in the use of trans fats , as a proportion of total daily calories , would prevent an estimated 11,000 heart attacks saving 7,000 lives a year .
",
5647,0,,"  consumption of trans fats in developed nations ranges from 2-4 per cent of total calorie intake , so it is a huge factor in many countries .
",
5648,0,,"  in new york , voluntary efforts to reduce their use by restaurants and retailers failed , however theban caused reasturants to stop using trans fats with the proportion of new york restaurants using them falling fromper cent to less thanper cent .
",
5649,0,,"  there were fears that trans fats would be replaced with saturated animal fat , but this has not been the case .
",
5650,0,," writing in the british medical journal , dariush mozaffarian , assistant professor of medicine , and meir stampfer , professor of epidemiology at harvard , say removing industrial trans fats is ` one of the most straightforward public health strategies for rapid improvements in health . '
",
5651,0,," a ban would save lives , be easy to implement yet have no impact on the price , sales , taste or availability of the affected foods .
",
5652,0,,"  moreover , no amount of trans fats is healthy , unlike other fats .
",
5653,0,," as catherine winters argues , `` while we know what a healthy level of saturated fat is ,percent or less of your daily calories , no one knows what a healthy level would be for trans fatty acids . ''
",
5654,0,,"  `` eating foods that contain trans fatty acids is like riding in a car without using a seat belt , '' says michael f. jacobson , phd , executive director of the center for science in the public interest , cspi , a washington , d.c.-based consumer advocacy organization concerned with health and nutrition issues .
",
5655,0,,"  a study published by the american journal of clinical nutrition also suggests that trans fats may increase a woman 's risk of fertility problems bypercent .
",
5656,0,," women who receivedpercent of their daily calories from trans fats , weretopercent more likely to suffer infertility due to lack of ovulation .
",
5657,0,," for someone with a 2,000 calorie diet , this level of intake could be achieved by consuming justgrams of trans fats a day , an amount that could be found in a single doughnut or portion of french fries .
",
5658,0,," ` it 's really a small amount of fats that we observed having a significant effect on infertility , ' said lead researcher dr. jorge chavarro . ''
",
5659,0,,"  by contrast to natural fats , trans fats are entirely synthetic , and pose a significantly greater risk to individuals ' long term health than natural saturated fats .
",
5660,0,," for this reason , it is reasonable to consider banning them .
",
5661,0,,"  bans should be reserved for very serious health crises .
",
5662,0,," the infertility , obesity , heart attacks , and death caused by the presence of trans fats in diets is such a crisis .
",
5663,0,," a ban is , thus , an appropriate regulatory response .
",
5664,0,," one of the purposes of government is identify possible threats to health and protect the people from these threats .
",
5665,0,," the fact that some government regulations seem ` silly ' or misplaced , or can not easily be understood by lay-people is not a compelling argument for having no regulations at all , or for not having regulations in the case of trans fat .
",
5666,0,," the commentators who denounce the ` nanny state ' do not indicate what , if any , regulations or styles of regulation they approve of .
",
5667,0,," do they think there should be no inspections of restaurants by health inspectors ?
",
5668,0,," no regulation at all of food or drug safety by the food and drug administration ?
",
5669,0,," some commentators think that people should be encouraged to study the dangers of trans fats and make their own judgements about what to eat .
",
5670,0,," but people have limited time to do research on such matters .
",
5671,0,," it makes sense to delegate the research to a central authority , so that instead ofmillion people trying to learn about trans fats and every other lurking menace , a handful of experts can make recommendations based on the likely responses and desires of the average , informed citizen .
",
5672,0,," non-specialists ' capacity to absorb information on complex chemical and biological subjects is quite limited .
",
5673,0,," the majority of us are reliant on the research of others for most of what we know .
",
5674,0,,"  the opinion of the experts on the dangers of trans fats is conclusive : trans fats are unsafe .
",
5675,0,," the american food and drug administration , fda , considers all uses of trans fats to be ` generally regarded as safe . '
",
5676,0,," this allows the use of trans fats in whatever way food producers desire .
",
5677,0,," 's afe ' for the fda means ' a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under its intended conditions of use ' , which no longer applies to trans fats .
",
5678,0,," this ` generally regarded as safe ' status should be revoked which in turn would greatly restrict its use in food .
",
5679,0,," the other option would be to allow local jurisdictions to regulate trans fats , but this would be more costly and lead to a patchwork of regulations .
",
5680,0,,"  the most effective method of controlling the use of trans-fats is through centralised , nationally applicable policy making .
",
5681,0,," the poor and young are particularly vulnerable to the negative health effects of trans fats ; at the very least , the threat posed to these groups justifies the use of informed regulation .
",
5682,0,," professor alan maryon-davis , president of the uk faculty of public health said in: `` there are great differences in the amount of trans-fats consumed by different people and we are particularly concerned about young people and those with little disposable income who eat a lot of this type of food .
",
5683,0,," this is a major health inequalities issue . ''
",
5684,0,,"  the government has a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from harms that they are not best placed to understand or avoid themselves , and so a ban on trans fats would not only save lives but would also be legitimate under the government 's role to protect when citizens can not reasonably protect themselves .
",
5685,0,," it is easy and inexpensive to replace trans fats with other , less harmful products without significantly altering the taste of the food .
",
5686,0,," kraft eliminated trans fats from its oreo cookies , with little public perception of any change in taste .
",
5687,0,,"  similarly , the wendy 's restaurant chain tested a new frying oil infranchises , with customers not noticing a difference in taste .
",
5688,0,," denmark imposed a national ban on trans fats with which even mcdonald 's has complied .
",
5689,0,,"  replacements for trans fats will get cheaper and cheaper with time , as they are used more frequently and as the companies that produce and distribute them increase their sales volumes and are able to sell them for lower prices .
",
5690,0,," since trans fats are not irreplaceable , objections for the sake of consumer freedom are also unconvincing .
",
5691,0,," as with lead added to paint , trans fats are unnecessary additions to products that can cause significant harm .
",
5692,0,," most people remain ignorant of the presence of trans-fats in their food , and of their effects .
",
5693,0,," in this area the ban on trans fats differs from restrictions placed on the sale of alcohol and tobacco and so the two kinds of bans are not comparable .
",
5694,0,," not only are trans fats easy to substitute in foodstuffs , without impairing quality or taste , the presence of trans-fats is hard to detect .
",
5695,0,," it is all-but impossible for informed and conscientious consumers to avoid buying and eating trans-fats .
",
5696,0,," while banning cigarettes and alcohol mean banning an entire product category , banning the ingredient of trans fats means no such thing .
",
5697,0,," rather , it simply means that readily available replacement ingredients must be used in the preparation of the same foods .
",
5698,0,," and , since these fatty replacements are widespread and cheaply available , food makers and consumers should have little difficulty making the adjustment to making and consuming the same , albeit slightly modified , foods .
",
5699,1,,"drug companies like glaxosmithkline (gsk) and merck are amongst the most profitable companies in the world.
",
5700,1,," arguably the drugs they research and produce are among the most important products any company sells.
",
5701,1,," although the proposition could choose to discuss the advertising of non-prescription drugs, a better debate can be had over prescription drugs (drugs requiring a doctor’s authorization before a pharmacist can dispense them to a patient) because states across the world have taken very different positions on the issue.
",
5702,1,," only two countries currently allow the practice: the united states and new zealand.
",
5703,1,," however it has been considered elsewhere, including a proposal by the european commission in 2001, which suggested limited direct-to-consumer advertising (dtca), but which was rejected in 2003.
",
5704,1,,"while the eu does not have a regulated system some of the countries have certain exemptions for advertising: in france, dtca (direct to consumer advertising) of non-prescription medicines is permissible only if purchasers are not reimbursed by the social security system.
",
5705,1,," moreover, disease awareness campaigns are considered legal only if such campaigns do not refer directly or indirectly to the product or therapeutic class.
",
5706,1,," in spain, dtca is allowed only for medicines that treat minor symptoms.
",
5707,1,,"outside the us, new zealand, bangladesh and south korea allow limited dtc (direct to consumer) advertising, while in some other markets limited advertising has been permitted for certain vaccines.
",
5708,1,,"  the most attention, however, has been on whether europe will ever permit dtc — particularly as european regulators have often adapted a number of u.s. regulations for the region.
",
5709,1,,"the u.s. system dates fromlegislation and is administered by the food and drug administration (fda).
",
5710,1,," all adverts, which are predominantly television or print in form, must include a written (and voiced in the case of tv adverts) list of possible side effects and risks, as well as a phrase insisting consumers ask their doctors whether the drug is appropriate for them.
",
5711,1,," they now account for a large proportion of the us advertising market and are blamed by some for the rapid increase in us health costs.
",
5712,1,," others defend advertising as a helpful tool for matching the right drugs to the patients that need them.
",
5713,1,," should we allow direct advertisement of the prescription drugs to consumers or should the products be advertised mainly to physicians, as is the practice in europe?
",
5714,0,,"   advertising serves an important purpose by informing the public about a specific product .
",
5715,0,," it is also regulated from manipulation , and therefore deserves no special restrictions ; these same restrictions and watchdogs would be in place if advertising of drugs were allowed to make sure that no drug is misrepresented .
",
5716,0,," we trust consumers to view adverts with a level of skepticism and we know that they form only one part of the research that goes into , say , buying a car .
",
5717,0,," drug companies have become more open in recent years .
",
5718,0,," for instance , gsk now publishes the results of all their drug trials , including the ones that fail , online and there are plenty of other sources of information on drugs available .
",
5719,0,," a drug that remains unused is a drug that is helping nobody ; adverts are simply a reasonable way for drug companies to help consumers find out about their products within a safe and highly regulated environment .
",
5720,0,," when the first discussion in the european parliament was started , regarding the advertisement of pharmaceuticals , the pharmaceutical industry specifically pointed out the anomaly that exists : `` specific laws stood in the way of it communicating with patients over its products , even when others could .
",
5721,0,," presumably , this meant information was communicated by the media about new medicines .
",
5722,0,," in this regard , the restrictions on the pharma industry contrast with the freedom enjoyed by manufacturers of vitamins and herbal remedies , who routinely advertise products to patients . ''
",
5723,0,," this shows that it is unjust to make any differences between the companies .
",
5724,0,," advertising prescription drugs enables patients to learn , and to request innovation faster in order to benefit from the new drugs that health personnel still have not gotten used to .
",
5725,0,," advertising increases consumer awareness of drugs , which makes consumers more likely to take appropriate medication .
",
5726,0,," the drugs market is complex and so advertising can help explain the differences between treatments , for example between contraceptive pills intended to reduce period pain , period flow and those simply to prevent pregnancy .
",
5727,0,," advertising under current rules is used to inform patients of new drugs which may be appropriate for conditions which they suffer from , such as recent asthma drugs which reduce the frequency of attacks , but which their doctor might overlook or not have the time to crosscheck against her list of patients .
",
5728,0,," 56 % of ama general practitioners believed that direct-to-consumer advertising had prompted some of their patients to seek treatment for a condition which would have otherwise been neglected .
",
5729,0,," if a patient has taken the time to actively consider a particular drug and then visits their doctor , whether they are prescribed it or not , they are building up a positive relationship with their doctor and are more likely to continue to take an active interest in their health .
",
5730,0,," further on , in states where there is no direct to consumer advertising but there is advertising to doctors , patients are disadvantaged because it is in the interest for private medical insurance firms or national health services to keep information about expensive new drugs from patients .
",
5731,0,," in the uk it was because of cost that the primary care trusts , pcts , refused to allow the prescription of herceptin , a drug which us studies have shown reduces the damage done by breast cancer .
",
5732,0,," ultimately pressure from roche , the drug 's manufacturer and from patients resulted in the drug being authorized for use , but the process was much faster in the us where roche could run advertisements alerting consumers to the potential benefits of herceptin , and thereby immediately giving patients access to a similar level of information as their doctors and allowing them to push for its authorization .
",
5733,0,," advertisements -- especially those that identify symptoms -- can lead to a healthier citizenry , as consumers become aware of their diseases earlier , and can thus find the drug that targets their problem at an earlier stage .
",
5734,0,," many drugs can prevent or reduce the likelihood of a patient requiring surgery , for instance anti-cholesterol drugs can reduce the buildup of atheroma in blood vessels , which cause cardiovascular heart disease and strokes , thus reducing the likelihood of a heart bypass being required and improving any post-stroke rehabilitation .
",
5735,0,," this not only saves money but is also better for patients .
",
5736,0,," surgery involves the risk of complications as well as taking time both directly and in post-operation rehabilitation .
",
5737,0,," also many degenerative conditions can be best treated by early intervention ; if patients are aware of the drugs that are available at an early stage they are more likely to take them , thereby increasing their standard of living and reducing their long-term cost to state or private health cover providers .
",
5738,0,," we should not attack drugs companies for making profits from their products , nor for encouraging patients to use them .
",
5739,0,," each new drug costs an average of $ 500m to produce and very small percentage of the drugs that are researched ever make it to the market .
",
5740,0,," the more profitable the industry , the more new drugs it can afford to research and develop and thus the more patients who can receive appropriate treatment .
",
5741,0,," many of the complex cures being developed for diseases like cancer , hiv/aids , sars and avian flu will take decades to research .
",
5742,0,," in the meantime , drug companies require funding streams from other drugs to continue research .
",
5743,0,," drugs have become increasingly expensive and advertisement helps to cover those costs .
",
5744,0,," fromand, from about $billion , indollars , to $billion .
",
5745,0,," there has been a real growth rate of aboutpercent a year , on average .
",
5746,0,," by comparison , drug firms ' gross margins -- sales revenue minus costs and income taxes -- have been increasing more slowly , by aboutpercent annually .
",
5747,0,," so , with more personalized medicine and greater costs in drug development , the industry needs a greater source of revenue in order to research therapeutics further .
",
5748,0,," advertising would provide this revenue .
",
5749,1,,"human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) in people, a condition in which the patient’s immune system is progressively compromised until it is unable to combat opportunistic infections and cancers.
",
5750,1,,"  hiv progresses to aids at a very variable rate that depends upon the health of the patient but on average takes aroundyears.
",
5751,1,," a person with aids will only survive for about a year without treatment, but in a western state with access to the latest treatments life expectancy can be raised to several decades.
",
5752,1,,"  like all viruses hiv is incurable and it has proven difficult to develop a vaccine.
",
5753,1,,"  the main routes of hiv infection are through blood transfusions (largely eliminated in the developed world by screening), unsafe sex, contaminated needles and mother-to-daughter transmission either in the womb or though breast milk.
",
5754,1,," hiv is therefore a disease which is very difficult to transmit, yet at the same time extremely lethal.
",
5755,1,,"  it’s been estimated that aids killedmillion people betweenand 2005, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in recorded history.
",
5756,1,,"  even in the developed world, hiv infection is a life changing event that will require the patient to carefully adjust many aspects of their life.
",
5757,1,,"  they will have to participate in a rigorous anti-viral treatment regime that requires taking drugs several times a day.
",
5758,1,,"  an employer may (depending on the circumstances) have serious concerns about the hiv status of his employees given the possible risks to themselves, to other employees, and to their future within the business.
",
5759,0,," it 's in the interests of employers .
",
5760,0,," a long , incurable and debilitating condition has stricken one of their employees .
",
5761,0,," they will have to make provision for possible sickness cover and replacement workers , potentially for medical and/or retirement costs .
",
5762,0,," hiv can make people tired and can lead to being sick more often as it means the immune system will not be able to fight off infections as well as it normally would .
",
5763,0,," the employee 's productivity might be reduced to the point at which their continued employment is no longer viable .
",
5764,0,," if things are made difficult for employers with hiv positive workers , then they are less likely in the future to employ people who , they suspect , are hiv positive .
",
5765,0,," employers must be listened to in this debate -- in many hiv-stricken countries , they 're the last thing between a semi-functioning society and complete economic and social collapse .
",
5766,0,," traditional rights ideas such as concerns about privacy of medical records are less important than the benefit to society of being able to cope with the unique problem of hiv more effectively .
",
5767,0,," it 's in the interests of the hiv positive employee .
",
5768,0,," right now , although in many countries it is illegal to fire someone for having hiv prejudiced employers can claim that they did n't know their employer had hiv when they fired him , so they must have been acting on other grounds .
",
5769,0,," the employee then has to try and prove that they did know , which can be very hard .
",
5770,0,," furthermore , once informed the employer can reasonably be expected to display a minimum level of understanding and compassion to the employee .
",
5771,0,," it 's in the interests of other workers .
",
5772,0,," the possibility of transmission , while very unlikely , is real and one they have a right to know about so as to be able to guard against it .
",
5773,0,," while most of the time it will not be problem as transmission requires a transfer of bodily fluids this may occasionally happen in a workplace .
",
5774,0,," this is particularly true of healthworkers , e.g. doctors , nurses , dentists , midwives , paramedics , etc , who should have both a moral and a legal obligation to disclose if they are hiv-positive .
",
5775,0,," even outside the medical field industrial accidents may expose employees to risk .
",
5776,0,," employers have a duty to protect their workforce .
",
5777,0,," businesses ought to take a responsible and active position on hiv .
",
5778,0,," the issue is n't going to go away .
",
5779,0,," successful programs designed to help hiv-positive employees remain in the workplace for as long as they want to do so should be developed .
",
5780,0,," procedures for treating personnel with fairness and dignity must be put in place .
",
5781,0,," the potential fears and prejudices of other employees must be combated .
",
5782,0,," the beginning of that process is ensuring they know about the problem and , crucially , the scale of it .
",
5783,0,," without knowledge of the numbers involved , employers may put in place inadequate medical and pensions arrangements that will ultimately prove inadequate .
",
5784,1,,"clinical trials1,2 have four phases, which proceed sequentially.
",
5785,1,," not all drugs make it to the end of the process (if a drug ‘fails’ a phasetrial, there is little point in running it through phase 2!)
",
5786,1,,".
",
5787,1,,"preclinical trials: these happen in a lab, and whilst they almost invariably involve testing on animals, do not involve human testing.
",
5788,1,," the purpose of these trials is to establish whether the drug is safe and effective.
",
5789,1,,"phasetrials:the purpose of phasetrials is to discover possible side-effects, establish efficacy in humans and calculate what dosage is needed.
",
5790,1,,"these trials are the first to involve humans, and so involve a degree of risk.
",
5791,1,," to minimise this, researchers test on small groups (normally giving progressively greater doses to successive groups) using small doses.
",
5792,1,," sometimes healthy volunteers are used in these trials, and other times people who are very ill are recruited (e.g. the trial of a new cancer drug).
",
5793,1,," whether healthy or unwell volunteers are used depends on factors like whether the treatment involves a level of risk unacceptable to the healthy (e.g. a new form of chemotherapy would normally be trialled in an advanced cancer patient, because the level of risk and severity of expected side-effects are not acceptable to those who have nothing to gain.
",
5794,1,," further relevant factors include whether or not the treatment is feasible in a healthy volunteer.
",
5795,1,,"phasetrials:phasetrials test the treatment on larger groups of people with the relevant illness.
",
5796,1,," the purpose is to find out more about the efficacy of the drug (including which specific thing it treats best, e.g. a new form of chemotherapy might work better on some forms of cancer than others) and more about side-effects.
",
5797,1,,"these trials are tested against a placebo (e.g. an identical pill that doesn’t contain any medication).
",
5798,1,," that is, those recruited into the trial will be split into two groups, one of which receives the medicine, the other of which receives a placebo.
",
5799,1,," these are normally conducted under ‘double blind’ conditions: whilst everyone involved knows that there is the possibility of receiving a placebo, neither the patient nor the doctor giving the pill knows who is receiving what (obviously who gets what is nevertheless recorded).
",
5800,1,," the purpose of this is to find out whether the effect the treatment has is due to the drug, or whether it’s just due to the expectation of getting better (placebo effect).
",
5801,1,,"phasetrials:the purpose of phasetrials is to determine whether or not the new drug/treatment is better than the best currently available treatment.
",
5802,1,,"because this is a difficult thing to test, and may involve the measurement of small differences between treatments, a large sample size is needed (many people must be tested on).
",
5803,1,," for example, if we were testing a new drug for cancer (let’s call it newafex) we would get a big group of people, give half of them newafex, and the other half would receive the best current treatement (whatever drug they would have had if newafex didn’t exist; let’s call it oldafex).
",
5804,1,," then we look at remission rates (the percentage of people who get a bit better) and compare.
",
5805,1,,"a new drug is unlikely to get a license if it is not more effective than other drugs, although there are exceptions (if, for example, the side-effects are less severe, or variety is needed).
",
5806,1,,"phasetrials:these occur after a drug has been granted a licence (and is allowed to be prescribed by doctors).
",
5807,1,," their purpose is to determine the long term risks and benefits of the treatment, and monitor its performance when used more widely.
",
5808,1,," these go on for many years (and severe long term side-effects are rare), and it would consequently be impractical to perform this sort of long term testing before licensinggetting on to a clinical trial: patients who may benefit from a treatment that is being trialled can be referred to that trial by their doctors; the company trialling the drug will have criteria that that patient must meet in order to qualify for the trail and it is ultimately at their discretion, not the doctor’s, whether someone is accepted.
",
5809,1,,"healthy volunteers participating in phasetrials tend to be recruited through adverts, and are normally paid well for their participation.
",
5810,0,,"some countries do already allow the provision of unapproved drugs that are still going through trials on compassionate grounds through programs such as expanded access to investigational drugs for treatment use (united states), special access program (canada), and temporary authorisation for use (france).3we live in a free society , and accept that people have the right to do as they please ; including exposing themselves to risk , as long as in so doing they do not harm others , mill 's harm principle .1 to deny people the right to choose to take drugs that are still undergoing testing that , whilst they are risky , may save their lives , is a violation of this principle : in choosing to expose themselves to that risk , no-one else is harmed and indeed in the long run others may be saved as a result of the tests .
",
5811,0,," further , with the assistance of medical professionals and other support , the decision to take this risk can easily be well-informed and consensual .
",
5812,0,," at a point when all ordinary medical avenues have been expended , and the outcome appears bleak , new treatments still undergoing trials can be seen as the last hope .
",
5813,0,," people are often aware of the existence of currently experimental drugs , they are likely to research into possible cures , and indeed there may have been attempts by their doctor to get the patient onto the trial .
",
5814,0,," however , not everyone who could benefit from treatment is accepted onto a clinical trial : some trials , at some stages , restrict their recruitment to , for example , patients with no complicating factors or other illnesses .
",
5815,0,," it is unethical and cruel to make people live out their last days knowing that there was something that could have helped , but to which access was restricted through no fault of their own : thus , you should allow anyone with a terminal illness access to such treatments .
",
5816,0,," under the status quo , someone with a terminal illness is offered two choices : death , or to join a trial , where such trials exist .
",
5817,0,," however , when they join a trial they face the possibility that they will be given a placebo , not the drug .
",
5818,0,," whilst this is probably in the best interest of future patients , a good clinical trial will determine the efficacy of the new treatment , it rides roughshod over the rights of the current patients , not to be sacrificed for future generations , and the duty of physicians to act in the best interests of their present patients .
",
5819,0,," there are two consequences here : the first is that it is morally dubious to use the present patients as mere means to an end , rather than acting in their own best interests , especially where , if randomized to the placebo arm the outcome of death is a certainty .
",
5820,0,," the second consequence is a practical one : compliance with the trial is lessened at the point at which patients can take alternative measures to increase their chance of survival .
",
5821,0,," this was best documented during the early stages of the aids crisis in the 1980s , where there was evidence of ` cheating ' during the trials1 .
",
5822,0,," people lied or bribed their way into clinical studies ; and shared drugs to dilute the ` risk ' of being on placebo .
",
5823,0,," this has the obvious impact of casting doubt on the scientific results of the trials : you can no longer be sure who has taken what , and what other conditions they may have .
",
5824,0,," testing new drugs is a very expensive process , inthe average cost was estimated at aroundmillion for the large scale phase iii tests1 however this is contested and it could be much higher it represents% of pharmaceutical companies r&d expenditures , which since a recent estimated the development cost of a drug can be up to $ 5.8 billion , due to including failures , the cost of trials would in some cases then be $ 2billion ,2 which is currently funded by pharmaceutical companies .
",
5825,0,," they fund these tests because it is either impossible , very difficult or very risky to access large markets before testing has been completed , e.g. in the usa companies are only allowed to sell new drugs `` off-study '' , i.e. during trials , at cost3 , if you allow all terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs , you reduce the incentive for companies to continue testing their products : they will have access to a large market prior to the completion of testing , and will therefore have no incentive to complete trials , which are expensive and risk finding the product ineffective .
",
5826,1,,"this centres around ending the international ban on the cultivation of the coca plant for human consumption, as established by the united nations in thesingle convention on narcotic drugs, which prohibited the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes.
",
5827,1,," the coca leaf is listed on schedule i of thesingle convention together with cocaine and heroin.
",
5828,1,," the convention determined that “the parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild.
",
5829,1,," they shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated”, and that, “coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this convention”.
",
5830,1,," support for the legalization of coca cultivation centres around the andean countries of bolivia and peru, where coca leaf production and chewing is legal (within limits), but where cocaine production and use is illegal.
",
5831,1,," this kind of policy is sometimes known as a ""coca yes, cocaine no."" much of the support for legal coca cultivation surrounds its historic use among indigenous andeans and thus its cultural significance.
",
5832,1,," bolivia exists at the center of the international fight to legalize coca.
",
5833,1,," president evo morales has lead this charge, in particular advocating that the un narcotics commission change thesingle convention on narcotic drugs that forbids the production and use of coca.
",
5834,1,," president morales generated headlines by chewing coca while attending a meeting of the commission inand 2011.
",
5835,0,," the coca leaf , in its natural state , is not even a narcotic , even though thesingle convention on narcotic drugs considers the natural leaf to be so .
",
5836,0,," however it only truly becomes a narcotic when the paste or the concentrate is extracted from the leaf to form cocaine .
",
5837,0,," the simple coca leaf , by contrast , only has very mild effects when chewed and is different from cocaine .
",
5838,0,," inthe world health organisation found that the `` use of coca leaves appears to have no negative health effects and has positive therapeutic , sacred and social functions for indigenous andean populations . ''
",
5839,0,," it may even be useful in combating obesity , and there is no evidence that coca use is addictive .
",
5840,0,," at worst , it is comparable to caffeine in terms of its effect on its consumer .
",
5841,0,," therefore there are no significant health reasons behind this ban on the cultivation of coca leaves for their chewed consumption in its traditional form .
",
5842,0,," coca chewing is hugely prevalent amongst the peoples of the andes , and their social relationship with it is akin to that of ours with coffee in western nations .
",
5843,0,," this is why so many nations in this region can not and simply will not ever conform to any international ban that calls for phasing it out .
",
5844,0,," the custom of chewing coca leaves may date back as far asbc in the region , and so hugely pre-dates cocaine consumption , and thus should n't be bundled with it or banned on the grounds that cocaine is banned .
",
5845,0,," coca has also been a vital part of the religious traditions of the andean peoples from the pre-inca period through to the present , being used ` to communicate with the supernatural world and obtain its protection , especially with offerings to the pachamama , the personification and spiritual form of the earth . '
",
5846,0,," all south american countries have signed several declarations by the union of south american nations , unasur , that acknowledged that the chewing of coca leaves is an ancestral cultural expression that should be respected by the international community .
",
5847,0,," the international discouragement of the practice of chewing coca leaves and the prohibition on its use by andeans when they travel or reside abroad can thus be seen as a violation of their indigenous religious and traditional rights , and therefore is not acceptable on a moral level .
",
5848,0,," millions of people in south america chew coca leaves , so this practice can not simply be wished away .
",
5849,0,," moreover , it currently acts as a vital income source in many impoverished areas of the andes .
",
5850,0,," pasquale quispe  owner of a 7.4-acre bolivian coca farm , explained to the new york times in: `` coca is our daily bread , what gives us work , what gives us our livelihood . ''
",
5851,0,," previous attempts to eradicate coca cultivation in bolivia harmed the poorest farmers there and led to significant social unrest .
",
5852,0,," when it is allowed , however , coca cultivation can actually have economic benefits .
",
5853,0,," peasant cultivators in the andes have indicated their belief that coca chewing helps increase production in agriculture , fisheries and mining .
",
5854,0,," the legalization of coca cultivation globally would allow for the expansion of these economic benefits .
",
5855,0,," the coca leaf may have uses as a stimulant and flavouring agent in drinks , in which it is currently used to a limited extent in the west , but also in the expansion of the many domestic products currently in use in the andes , including syrups , teas , shampoo and toothpaste .
",
5856,0,," it may also have a use as a general anaesthetic .
",
5857,0,," only the legalization of its cultivation globally will allow these product and economic potentials to be fully realized and allow humanity to reap the full rewards of the coca plant , rather than simply being limited by the fear and stigma surrounding its illegal use in cocaine .
",
5858,1,,"in many countries, laws now exist which prevent people from smoking in public places, so that non-smokers can avoid breathing in secondhand smoke.
",
5859,1,," those who want a law preventing parents from smoking around their children (and punishing them if they do) see it as a natural and important next step; if we don’t let people smoke in public because they might endanger the lives of non-smokers around them, then it seems logical – say those in favour – to also have a law stopping parents from potentially harming their children through smoking in the home environment.
",
5860,1,,"  research has shown that second hand smoke is very bad for children’s health, and this is now widely accepted.
",
5861,1,,"  some medical experts believe it may be more dangerous than actual smoking because of the larger amount of cancer-causing chemicals in this type of smoke.
",
5862,1,,"  it can be especially harmful to babies and young children who are in the early stages of their physical development.
",
5863,1,," it may lead to less developed lungs and a series of respiratory (breathing) illnesses such as bronchitis, asthma and even heart conditions.
",
5864,1,,"  those in favour of this law see punishment (by escalating fines or maybe even imprisonment) as the best way to discourage parents from smoking around their children.
",
5865,0,," children whose parents smoke in the home are exposed to secondhand smoke without any choice ; they ca n't just leave to avoid the smoky air .
",
5866,0,," many studies have found a link between secondhand smoke exposure , through living or working with a smoker , and an increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer .
",
5867,0,," the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family '' .
",
5868,0,," because their respiration is hindered and their long term health is threatened , children who are being exposed to secondhand smoke against their will are therefore having their human rights infringed by their parents , and this properly subjects the parents to punishment .
",
5869,0,," studies have found that children with parents who smoke are much more likely to use drugs , and especially more likely to smoke cigarettes themselves .
",
5870,0,," children learn about the dangers of smoking and drugs in school , and know that it can damage health , but their parents are the most influential figures in their lives .
",
5871,0,," if they see their parents , supposedly responsible adults , constantly doing something , then they are bound to think that it is okay for them to do it too .
",
5872,0,," having a parent who smokes normalises smoking for the child , which is wrong .
",
5873,0,," in order to prevent this from happening , it is necessary to make sure that parents do not smoke in front of their children by punishing them if they do .
",
5874,0,," not being able to smoke in their home without risking punishment will make it much more difficult for parents to continue smoking , encouraging them to smoke much less or even give up altogether , which will improve their health .
",
5875,0,," this can be seen in reports which show that there was a big decrease in the number of smokers in england after the ban on smoking in public places there , presumably because they did n't want to have to go outside all the time and be away from their friends every time they wanted to have a cigarette .
",
5876,0,," similarly , many parents will give up smoking to avoid having to leave their children every time they want to have a cigarette or risk being punished .
",
5877,0,," given the high compliance rates of the bans on smoking in public places in countries like scotland , it is reasonable to predict that people will be just as law-abiding with a law that protects children from secondhand smoke in their homes .
",
5878,0,," part of the effect would deter parental smoking .
",
5879,0,," they may not want to break the law and realize that it is a serious enough issue for children 's health that they should stop .
",
5880,0,," furthermore , friends , relatives and others who care about the health and well-being of children could be trusted to ensure that those flouting the new law would be highlighted to police .
",
5881,0,," other means of making enforcement workable would be to prohibit smoking in vehicles with children under age, violations observed by traffic police could be handled like other vehicle-related infractions .
",
5882,0,," after providing ample advance notice of the new law 's start date , fines for violations in the home could be enforced , with each repeat violation receiving an increased fine .
",
5883,0,," control of one 's own body is the most fundamental of human rights .
",
5884,0,," no government should be permitted to define how its citizens can express themselves .
",
5885,0,," the distinction between the permissible and the impermissible should be drawn at the line of consent .
",
5886,0,," this is not a novel distinction .
",
5887,0,," your property can not be stolen from you if you agree to give it away .
",
5888,0,," you have no legal remedy if your property is damaged by another with your consent , or if you damage it yourself .
",
5889,0,," why should there be a moral difference when this property is flesh and blood ?
",
5890,0,," paternalism in this instance only protects those who do not want to be protected .
",
5891,0,," the prohibition of sadomasochism is simply inconsistent with the liberty that governments already permit their citizens to exercise to injure each other and themselves .
",
5892,0,," when people are entitled to risk pain , serious injury , or even death in sporting activity , why should they not also be permitted to suffer some discomfort in consensual sexual activity ?
",
5893,0,," the same piercing of flesh which attracts criminal liability in a fetishistic context can be performed legally in a chemist 's shop or tattooist 's parlor .
",
5894,0,," the distinction between the rugby scrum , the bungee tower and the bedroom is an arbitrary one .
",
5895,0,," some of the pleasure that is inherent in contact sports is derived from the adrenal thrill of flirting with injury .
",
5896,0,," it is widely known that a significant proportion of individuals find jeopardy and danger as enjoyable as decadence .
",
5897,0,," a sport purged of all risk would be unwatched and unplayed .
",
5898,0,," comparably , a corpus of law that did not acknowledge or protect the diversity of human sexual experience would needlessly limit individual sexual freedom , and would probably be ignored .
",
5899,0,," the criminalisation of s&m removes legal protection from individuals who suffer an abuse of consent while submitting to sadistic practices .
",
5900,0,," where a dominant partner ignores safe words or pushes a session too far , the criminal status of s&m may lead to a victim being prosecuted alongside a perpetrator .
",
5901,0,," alternately , victims may be disincentivised from approaching the police altogether .
",
5902,0,," although it is not possible to be prosecuted for being the victim of a crime , individuals who are harmed during sadomasochistic sex many not be able to engage in a rational assessment of their own criminal liability .
",
5903,0,," even though laws against sadomasochistic acts pin liability only on the sadistic partner , they also serve to criminalize the act itself .
",
5904,0,," victims of abuses of consent may therefore become wary of informing the police that they have participated in such activity , for fear that they will be publicly stigmatized or subjected to police investigation themselves .
",
5905,0,," the only time s&m can be problematic is when someone does not listen to their partner when they withdraw their consent and ask for the session to end .
",
5906,0,," individuals will not stop engaging in s&m simply because the state says so , but victims of over-aggressive partners will lose recourse or protection under the law if they try to approach the police about such an incident .
",
5907,0,," where an s&m session goes awry , victims of an abuse of consent will have to admit to engaging in a criminal act .
",
5908,0,," in the same way prostitutes have no real protection from assault and rape due to the criminality of their acts , victims of assault and rape in s&m are no longer protected .
",
5909,0,," the opposition may attempt to claim that there will be a clear distinction between a sadistic `` criminal '' and a submissive `` victim '' whenever a complaint is raised .
",
5910,0,," this is not true .
",
5911,0,," many sadomasochistic relationships are based around fluctuating and interchangeable roles .
",
5912,0,," both partners may engage in sadistic acts at different times .
",
5913,0,," it is sufficient for the decriminalization of sadomasochism that each participant is aware of the hazards inherent in the fetishes they will be exploring and consents to them .
",
5914,0,," no law prohibits people from refusing to wear a condom during sexual intercourse , notwithstanding the peril of infection .
",
5915,0,," furthermore , all cases where an individual withdraws their consent for the activity can be arbitrated and prosecuted like every other situation of consensual sex where an individual withdraws consent and their partner does not respect that wish .
",
5916,0,," the police and courts will investigate it in the same way and will prosecute those who commit rape under the guise of s&m just as they prosecute those who commit rape under the guise of consensual intercourse .
",
5917,0,," the idealization of physical beauty within american and european culture has created a demand for increasingly interventionist forms of cosmetic enhancement .
",
5918,0,," women and men are prepared to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to have their faces , breasts and genitals maimed and modified by surgeons , to have their skin bleached or their facial muscles temporarily paralyzed by `` beauticians '' and to be badgered , bullied and blackmailed into complying with restrictive diets and extensive regimes of physical exertion by domineering personal trainers .
",
5919,0,," except in the most extreme and obvious cases of emotional or psychological disturbance , adults are automatically assumed to be capable of consenting to these acts .
",
5920,0,," further , the western ideal of physical beauty is closely associated with the cultural norms that influence and control sexual attraction , compatibility and enjoyment .
",
5921,0,," the erotic is almost inextricably linked with the aesthetically idealized .
",
5922,0,," the intense pain and extensive physical injuries that individuals endure in the pursuit of physical beauty are also endured in the pursuit of sexual gratification .
",
5923,0,," the risks inherent in invasive cosmetic treatments are poorly explained .
",
5924,0,," the expense of these products and services and the pervasiveness of idealized physical forms combine to create parallel markets comprising cheaper , poorly regulated forms of `` beauty enhancement '' , including intensive tanning and skin bleaching lotions .
",
5925,0,," the ultimate objective of these physically painful and dangerous activities is sexual pleasure .
",
5926,0,," even if the heightening of sexual pleasure that results from physical modification is less direct than in a sadomasochistic encounter , many cosmetic surgery patients find the aesthetic pleasure attendant on successful surgery to be satisfying too .
",
5927,0,," it seems hypocritical and perverse for a supposedly liberal system of law to allow individuals who are openly pursuing a sexual objective to consent to the harms and risks of cosmetic surgery , while limiting the legality of sadomasochistic acts .
",
5928,0,," both activities have the same underlying purpose , and both produce dangerous externalities .
",
5929,0,," rational , consenting adults should have as much freedom to engage in s&m play as they currently have to submit to cosmetic surgery .
",
5930,1,,"wherever the issue has emerged, whether it is in the inner city schools of america, the primary schools of wales, or in health education programs in the developing world, the suggestion that condoms should be actively promoted as a solution to unwanted pregnancies has been controversial.
",
5931,1,," this is also the case for using condoms as a method of preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the proliferation of hiv infection.
",
5932,1,," scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the contention that condoms, when properly used, reduce the incidence of these problems.
",
5933,1,," however numerous critics fear that active encouragement of condom use advances the onset of sexual activity among young people.
",
5934,1,," in particular, more conservative religious traditions, as well as religious groups that oppose contraception, oppose the move to the distribution of condoms in schools out of fear that basic values of their religions might be undermined in their children.
",
5935,1,,"as an alternative, critics of condom distribution advocate abstinence-only education.
",
5936,1,," this variant of sex education encourages young people to abstain from sexual activity as a way to avoid pregnancy and disease.
",
5937,1,," unfortunately, such programs have had mixed or negative results.
",
5938,1,," in the developed world commercial influences and social pressures contribute to defiance of abstinence.
",
5939,1,," in developing countries, where cultures often encourage the development of large families and educational programs are not as well funded or comprehensive, critics feel the message lacks impact.
",
5940,1,,"because this issue has received a great deal of attention in the united states and the united kingdom as regards implementation in public schools, the temptation is to see this topic through only that lens.
",
5941,1,," however, debaters may just as easily consider broader educational programs instituted by governments to improve public health and population control.
",
5942,0,," debaters may also consider multinational and foreign aid programs designed to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and regulate population growth—all of which could contain a condom distribution component.
",
5943,0,,"providing condoms to students in public education programs will reduce the incidence of underage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
",
5944,0,," if one accepts the premise that condoms are an effective means of prevention , it stands to reason that their distribution could have a significant impact .
",
5945,0,," condoms are one of the most effective means of protecting against stis , sexually transmitted infections , hiv and pregnancy .
",
5946,0,," for their cost , they are easily the most effective means of protecting against these threats .
",
5947,0,,"  it is especially important that we equip schoolchildren with knowledge of how to use condoms given that rates of both teenage pregnancy and sti cases are alarmingly high in the uk , the uk has the highest number of teenage mothers in western europe .
",
5948,0,," something must be done to halt this trend , and it makes sense to make condoms available for use .
",
5949,0,," many young girls feel pressured into sex before they are ready .
",
5950,0,," this pressure is from various sources ; friends , boyfriends and the melange of mixed messages and highly sexualised role models communicated to them by the media .
",
5951,0,,"  girls growing are encouraged to be sexual beings and may feel they have no control over their own bodies .
",
5952,0,," giving girls condoms can do something to stop this .
",
5953,0,," by educating girls about condom use , girls can be informed about what to do when they are ready and how to control and react to the pressure to have sex .
",
5954,0,," providing access to birth control empowers women with more control over their bodies .
",
5955,0,," historically women have often suffered more because of restrictive policies related to reproduction , abortion laws , restrictions on birth control purchases  , parental consent policies  .
",
5956,0,," men often do not have to face the consequences of their actions .
",
5957,0,," condom distribution encourages the responsibility of men and increases choices for women .
",
5958,0,," it can also establish condom use as the norm , not something that women continually have to negotiate , often from a position of weakness .
",
5959,0,," as highlighted earlier , condom distribution can counter harms such as stis and teenage pregnancy .
",
5960,0,," it also can provide an educational benefit .
",
5961,0,," by providing teenagers with frank , straightforward information about both sex and condoms young people will be much more likely to understand when they are ready to have sex .
",
5962,0,," they will also be much more confident in rejecting unwanted advances and avoiding reckless or risky sexual encounters .
",
5963,0,," this policy will reduce the harms that are associated with a lack of sex education -- not just in terms of stis and pregnancy , but also misinformation and ignorance .
",
5964,0,," increasing numbers of teenagers are learning about sex via inaccurate and misleading portrayals of sexual activity , lad 's mugs , porn , television and film .
",
5965,0,," better to give teenagers the full facts about sex rather than obscuring it from them , causing them to be misinformed .
",
5966,1,,"we all want and should eat better.
",
5967,1,," and each of us has different definitions and priorities when it comes to “good food”.
",
5968,1,,"for some good equals healthy, low in fat and sugar.
",
5969,1,," not at all a bad idea in a world with more thanbillion overweight andmillion obese individuals where energy-dense, fat and sugar laden food takes most of the blame.
",
5970,1,,"for others the goal is to eat sustainably and for many that means eating food that was produced locally.
",
5971,1,," kaiser permamente discovered that it can reduce its carbon footprint by more thanpercent by using local produce in their menus.
",
5972,1,,"this could also mean eating food that is ‘fair trade’ that makes sure that a decent amount of the money spent by the consumer goes to the farmer who produces the food.
",
5973,1,,"lastly, and perhaps most controversially, some will refuse to eat genetically modified food, for fears they’re both unhealthy and unsustainable.
",
5974,1,,"underlying all those very diverse goals is labeling – specifically labeling food products with their fat and sugar content, origin, way of production and possibly gmo content.
",
5975,1,," but is this really a way to give the consumer the information she needs to reach her goals of health, sustainability and advocacy or will labeling foods fall short of its promise, leaving tax payers and companies to pay for the failed experiment?
",
5976,1,,"because this is such a broad topic, we’ll be looking at the combined issues of different labeling schemes, focusing on the gda-system and the traffic light system, which have been introduced in the uk and elsewhere in the eu and labeling foods containing gmos, allowed on a voluntary basis in the us.
",
5977,1,," thus the government in today’s debate stands for all sorts of food labeling: all contents, gda and traffic lights, origin and gmo content.
",
5978,0,," it is a basic right for us as consumers to know what it is we eat .
",
5979,0,," today more and more foods that we buy are processed , they include many harmful additives , causing conditions such as hyperactivity in children , or are advertised as health food , but are in reality loaded with sugar or salt .
",
5980,0,," it is therefore necessary for consumers to be made aware of all their food contains in order to make safe and healthy choices for themselves and their families .
",
5981,0,," given that there is a global trend of increasing numbers of overweight and obese people , food that is fattening and therefore contributes to this problem needs to be clearly labeled so people can avoid them .
",
5982,0,," research shows that having this nutritional information helps people make better choices .
",
5983,0,," up to% of consumers reconsider buying a food item after reading the food label and finding out what 's inside .
",
5984,0,," another study points out that there were `` significant differences in mean nutrient intake of total calories , total fat , saturated fat , cholesterol , sodium , dietary fiber , and sugars '' when people could go ahead and use the information about the food they were considering buying .
",
5985,0,," it is therefore clear that making more information about food available , especially in the form of readily available food labels , helps people make choices that will help the fight against obesity .
",
5986,0,," innovation is inevitable .
",
5987,0,," that holds true for food industry as much as any other industry -- and the food companies want to share their progress with the consumer to benefit from it .
",
5988,0,," with the impact food labeling has on consumer choices , companies turned the issue on its head , producing food that is more in tune with what the people want and using labels to tell us about it .
",
5989,0,," an example is pepsico 's `` smart spot '' program that is intended to help consumers identify healthier products -- products the company developed as a consequence of consumer pressure for healthier drinks that contain less sugar .
",
5990,0,," what is more , the strategy proved very profitable for the company , with the smart spot products sales increasingpercent or three times as fast as the rest of the business .
",
5991,0,," we see that companies were able to adapt to the pressure labeling created with excellent products , in tune with consumer values , and make a profit as well .
",
5992,1,,"junk food is defined by segen’s medical dictionary as “a popular term for any food which is low in essential nutrients and high in everything else—in particular calories and sodium.
",
5993,1,," junk foods are often highly salted—e.g., potato chips/crisps, pretzels—high in refined carbohydrates (empty calories)—e.g., candy, soft drinks—and high in saturated fats—e.g., cake, chocolates”.
",
5994,1,," individual school governing bodies are however likely to come up with their own definitions of what exactly constitutes junk food for their ban.
",
5995,1,,"childhood obesity- defined as a body-mass index at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex, was diagnosed among approximatelypercent of children and adolescents in the united states in the period fromthrough 2002.
",
5996,1,," according to the national health and nutrition examination surveys, the prevalence of overweight children doubled between 1976–1980 and 1999–2002.
",
5997,1,," although the prevalence of overweight among blacks, mexican americans, and native americans exceeds that of other ethnic groups, obesity has increased among both sexes and among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.
",
5998,1,,"childhood obesity is associated with a variety of adverse consequences.
",
5999,1,," type-2 diabetes now accounts for up topercent of all newly diagnosed diabetic disorders in pediatric patients.
",
6000,1,," conditions associated with excess weight, such as sleep apnea and gallbladder disease, tripled in children and adolescents between 1979–1981 and 1997–1999.
",
6001,1,," although childhood-onset obesity accounts for onlypercent of adult obesity, overweight that begins before age eight and persists into adulthood is associated with a mean body-mass index ofin adulthood, as compared with a body-mass index offor adult-onset obesity.1researchers and public health officials are currently at a loss to explain the rapid rise in weight problems among children and adolescents that began in the 1980s.
",
6002,1,," concerns about the long-term health consequences of being overweight have ignited a debate about school policies that make junk food available to students in school.
",
6003,1,,"the proponents of the idea that school lunches are inexorably linked to the childhood obesity epidemic rally behind much publicized campaigns, such as the one initiated by the first lady michelle obama called “let’s move”.
",
6004,1,," even though this seems to be a popular and intuitively appealing notion, there are two important questions being raised by its opponents: is the notion correct and are the schools, or rather school lunches, really the ones we should be targeting?
",
6005,1,,"in september 2006, partly influenced by the campaigning activities of celebrity chef jamie oliver, some schools in the united kingdom implemented a new approach to preparing and sourcing pupils’ meals.
",
6006,1,," this policy requires that caterers ensure that high-quality meat, poultry or oily fish is provided with each meal, alongside at least two servings of fruit and vegetables.
",
6007,1,,"    another approach to banning junk food is also the banning of vending machines with junk food.
",
6008,1,," the new dispensers in the uk, through a government funded project, switched from sweets and junk in the vending machines (which is present inper cent of secondary schools) to milk, fruit, water and other healthy products to buy.
",
6009,1,,"such an approach, where the government takes care of the meals and also preventing the offer of junk in schools is a way how to do it also in other countries.
",
6010,0,,"  under the pressure of increasing media coverage and civil society initiatives , schools are being called upon to `` take up arms '' against childhood obesity , both by introducing more nutritional and physical education classes , as well as transforming the meals they are offering in their cafeterias .
",
6011,0,," never before has school been so central to a child 's personal and social education .
",
6012,0,," according to a study conducted by the university of michigan , american children and teenagers spend in school about 32.5 hours per week homework a week -- 7.5 hours more , thanyears ago .
",
6013,0,," school curricula now cover topics such as personal finance , sex and relationships and citizenship .
",
6014,0,," a precedent for teaching pupils about living well and living responsibly has already been established .
",
6015,0,," some schools , under national health programs , have given out free milk and fruit to try and make sure that children get enough calcium and vitamins , in case they are not getting enough at home .
",
6016,0,," while we are seeing various nutritional and health food curricula cropping up , revamping the school lunch is proving to be a more challenging task .
",
6017,0,," `` limited resources and budget cuts hamper schools from offering both healthful , good-tasting alternatives and physical education programs , `` says sanchez-vaznaugh , a san francisco state university researcher .
",
6018,0,," with expert groups such as the obesity society urging policy makers to take into account the complex nature of the obesity epidemic , especially the interplay of biological and social factors that lead to individuals developing the disease , it has become time for governments to urge schools to put their education into practice and give students an environment that allows them to make the healthy choices they learn about in class .
",
6019,0,," schools are playing an increasingly formative role , in the sense that they 're being tasked with not only knowledge transfer , but also the creation of behaviors and placing emphasis on teaching students how to apply their knowledge .
",
6020,0,," given this expanded mandate , the schools are not only obliged to therefore offer choices that would go hand in hand with healthier behavior , but also the perfect pressure point for lawmakers to go about introducing healthier lifestyles .
",
6021,0,," the simple reason is that our kids are increasingly looking not to their parents , but schools and the environments they provide , for advice on how to live their lives .
",
6022,0,," they are also the traditional environments for youth to continuously invent and reinvent themselves and therefore hold immense potential for behavior modification .
",
6023,0,," there is a growing body of evidence linking a healthy lifestyle , comprising of both adequate nutrition and physical exercise , with improved memory , concentration and general academic performance .
",
6024,0,," a study has shown that when primary school students consume three or more junk food meals a week literacy and numeracy scores dropped by up to% compared to the average .
",
6025,0,," this is a clear incentive for governments to push forward for healthier meals in schools for two reasons .
",
6026,0,," the first obvious benefit is to the student , whose better grades award her improved upward mobility -- especially important for ethnic groups stuck worst by the obesity epidemic and a lower average socioeconomic status .
",
6027,0,," the second benefit is to the schools , who benefit on standardized testing scores and reduced absenteeism , as well as reduced staff time and attention devoted to students with low academic performance or behavior problems and other hidden costs of low concentration and performance of students .
",
6028,1,,"governments all over the world have spent decades and billions fighting a ""war on drugs"".
",
6029,1,," however, many believe that the most commonly used illegal drug, cannabis, should not be illegal at all.
",
6030,1,,"advocates of legalization point out cannabis' medicinal properties, its ability to open up the mind, and plentiful evidence that it is less harmful than both alcohol and tobacco.
",
6031,1,," critics of legalization meanwhile cite studies showing cannabis' harmful physical and psychotic effects and its tendency to act as a gateway to harder and more dangerous drugs.
",
6032,1,,"the debate can also be framed as one that pits the concept of freedom of the individual against the concept of the paternalistic state.
",
6033,1,," some will argue that people should be allowed to do whatever they please to their own bodies.
",
6034,0,," others believe the state has a responsibility to protect people from harming themselves, and indirectly harming others, by smoking cannabis.
",
6035,0,,"it is important that we have the liberty to do what we want to our own bodies .
",
6036,0,," people are allowed to eat or drink to their detriment .
",
6037,0,," in many countries it is legal to take one 's life .
",
6038,0,," why then , should people not be allowed to harm themselves through cannabis use ?
",
6039,0,," , assuming that cannabis use is harmful .
",
6040,0,," in most cases , this is highly debatable .
",
6041,0,," , smoking cannabis may have effects on others , such as through the effects of passive smoking .
",
6042,0,," however , regulation has been brought in to minimize the effects on others for alcohol and cigarettes , such as bans on smoking in public places , and the same thing could be done for cannabis .
",
6043,0,," although cannabis can have some harmful effects , it is not nearly as harmful as tobacco or alcohol .
",
6044,0,," research by the british medical association shows that nicotine is more addictive .
",
6045,0,," in england and wales , cannabis was said to have helped causedeaths , compared tofor alcohol and 86,500 for tobacco1 .
",
6046,0,," a study , published by the lancet , that scores drugs out offor the harm they cause the user and others , gave alcohol, tobaccoand cannabis.
",
6047,0,," many of the problems associated with cannabis use arise from the fact that it is illegal .
",
6048,0,," cannabis is the world 's most widely used illegal drug --% of canadians admit to having smoked it and up tomillion people in the uk are estimated to do so .
",
6049,0,," in, the un estimated that the market for illegal drugs was worth $billion .
",
6050,0,," this market is run by criminals and is often blighted by violence .
",
6051,0,," it has cost thousands of innocent lives , particularly in supplier countries such as mexico and afghanistan.
",
6052,0,," in the us , milton friedman estimated that 10,000 people die every year as a result of drug dealers fighting over territory.
",
6053,0,," many of the victims are innocent people , caught in crossfire .
",
6054,0,," by legalizing cannabis , the size of this market for illegal drugs would be significantly reduced and so , effectively , would the number of crimes and unnecessary deaths that come with it .
",
6055,0,," another way of seeing the problems of prohibition is to look at the failed attempt at alcohol prohibition in the 1920s .
",
6056,0,," people continued to consume alcohol , only it becameper cent stronger , was as easy to obtain for minors as for adults , and was sold by murderous gangsters like al capone.
",
6057,0,," given all of the problems associated with prohibiting cannabis , it seems nonsensical to spend billions fighting a drugs war when instead governments could reduce crime and make money by selling cannabis in a regulated manner .
",
6058,0,," they could spend some of the profit on treating people who did experience any harmful effects .
",
6059,0,," 3 .
",
6060,1,,"this issue is about late-term abortions, in the second and third trimesters.
",
6061,1,," at least 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester, when other procedures are more appropriate.
",
6062,1,," in partial-birth abortion (pba), also known as dilation and extraction (d&x), the woman's cervix is dilated, and the foetus is partially removed from the womb, feet first.
",
6063,1,," the surgeon inserts a sharp object into the back of the foetus' head, removes it, and inserts a vacuum tube through which the brain is extracted.
",
6064,1,," the head of the foetus contracts at this point and allows the foetus to be more easily removed from the womb.
",
6065,1,,"  the main justifications for the use of d&x are: that the foetus is dead; that continued pregnancy will endanger the life of the mother; that continued pregnancy will adversely affect the mother’s health; that the foetus is so malformed that it will never gain consciousness after birth.
",
6066,1,," more controversial is the use of the technique for healthy foetuses when the mother’s life is not at risk.
",
6067,1,," this is banned by several state medical associations in the us, but many physicians have reported performing them, mainly for women who are suicidally depressed, but also for rape victims and for very young pregnant women.
",
6068,1,,"it is estimated that about 3,000 partial-birth abortions were performed per year in the united states in the 1990s (though this represents around 0.2% of the total number of abortions).
",
6069,1,," bill clinton vetoed bills banning partial-birth abortions in 1995,and 1999.
",
6070,1,," george w. bush signed a partial-birth abortion ban into law in 2003, and this was found constitutional inby the us supreme court in planned parenthood federation of america v. gonzales (largely reversing the court's decision in acase on state law).
",
6071,1,," although this is not necessarily a us-specific debate, the issue is on the political agenda in the usa to an extent which is not matched elsewhere, and some of the arguments here reflect this.
",
6072,1,," in running this debate (and with all other abortion debates) it is necessary to consider whether or not an exception will be made for medical necessity.
",
6073,1,,"nb in addition to the arguments below, this debate may well employ arguments from debates about abortion in general – consult the entry for ‘abortion’ in debatabase, and the materials linked to from there.
",
6074,0,," partial-birth abortion is disgusting .
",
6075,0,," like all abortions , it involves the killing of an unborn child , but unlike first trimester abortions there is no doubt that the foetus can feel pain by the third trimester .
",
6076,0,," the procedure involves sticking a pair of scissors into a baby 's brain , enlarging the hole , sucking the brain out with a catheter and then crushing the skull .
",
6077,0,," it is entirely unacceptable to do this to a living human being .
",
6078,0,," psychological damage to the mother as a result of rape or teenage pregnancy or depression is in the end less significant than the physical damage - death - caused to the child .
",
6079,0,," if birth is the crucial dividing-line we use to decide when legal personhood begins , then we should not be allowed to induce birth and then deliberately kill a foetus during that process - this is different from early abortion in which birth is induced and the foetus dies naturally .
",
6080,0,," partial-birth abortion is murder , even on the pro-choice understanding of personhood .
",
6081,0,," tragically , some babies are unwanted , but this does not mean that we should kill them .
",
6082,0,," there are plenty of other options , notably adoption .
",
6083,0,," if anything , the case for adoption is more compelling in the third trimester , because the pregnancy is nearer to its natural end and there is less time , only about ten weeks , for the mother to have to put up with it .
",
6084,0,," unwanted pregnancy and adoption may be psychologically harmful , but in many cases so is abortion , particularly at a late stage of pregnancy when the mother can see that the dead foetus is recognisably a baby - the guilt feelings associated with feeling that one is responsible for murdering a child can be unbearable .
",
6085,1,,"inthe global population is set to stand at 8.9 million (un-population, 2004).
",
6086,1,," africa, as a whole, will account for 20% of the world’s population by 2050.
",
6087,1,," such figures have raised concern within discussions on development and the environment.
",
6088,1,," how can the rising population continue to sustain itself?
",
6089,1,," theories have previously been used to express how populations interact with the environment.
",
6090,1,," firstly, malthusian and neo-malthusian perspectives emphasise the environmental sets limits to growth.
",
6091,1,," a population size can only be sustained over time as long as it doesn’t rise over the environmental threshold limit to growth.
",
6092,1,," secondly, and alternatively, boserup’s theory suggests that when faced with scarce environmental resources we make adaptations over time.
",
6093,1,," the growth in a population can be met with technological, and political, alterations to its environment to adapt and sustain expansion.
",
6094,1,," following such ideas raises the question: what action should be taken to control the rising demands made on diminishing resources?
",
6095,1,," one such strategy is family planning.
",
6096,1,,"family planning schemes have been implemented across africa.
",
6097,1,," the implementation of family planning has been justified through environmental, gender, and economical, discourses.
",
6098,1,," this can mean presenting family planning as an effective means to control the population demand on scarce resources; empower; and offer an opportunity to reduce vulnerabilities within livelihoods.
",
6099,1,," however, a key critique raised against family planning approaches is how it should be approached.
",
6100,1,," the case of uganda raises interesting debate.
",
6101,1,," uganda’s approach has called for the direct inclusion of men.
",
6102,1,," often in family planning women are targeted as the recipients, distributors, and key actors, within family planning in africa.
",
6103,1,," however, in uganda’s approach family planning works across gender.
",
6104,1,," family planning is a service provided by the government along with international actors such as the un population fund(heuler, 2012).
",
6105,1,," the service involves providing a range of short and long-term contraceptive methods (i.e. distributing condoms and injections; or providing education and advice).
",
6106,1,," both men and women are called upon, to understand and be aware of what measures to take.
",
6107,1,,"this returns to the concept of family planning and how it is applied in the case of uganda, to question whether bringing in men is the right approach.
",
6108,1,," in doing so investigation is provided into what family planning is; whether it should be used; and whether the problem is who is involved.
",
6109,0,," by including men in family planning programs and the decisions made concerning family structures equality is enabled .
",
6110,0,," the decisions made , and responsibilities , concerning the ` family ' are no longer solely the burden of the woman .
",
6111,0,," men are provided with a voice , and therefore responsibility and obligation to act upon caring for the family .
",
6112,0,," by introducing men into family planning a platform is provided enabling negotiations on the family to be discussed between man and woman .
",
6113,0,," men are key actors in decisions made ; therefore their inclusion is fundamental .
",
6114,0,," this also means that the man is also much more likely to take on other responsibilities in terms of caring for the family or doing things the woman would have done in the past like collecting medicine , wasswa  .
",
6115,0,," by including men in family planning the ideas , and misconceptions , of what happens when women use family planning can be changed .
",
6116,0,," gender-based violence is a key concern that can be reduced by involving men in family planning decisions .
",
6117,0,," if they buy into having fewer children then they are less likely to object to using contraception and condoms -- something that has other potential benefits such as preventing stds .
",
6118,0,," the united nations development fund for women has found that one in four women is abused during pregnancy , teaching men about reproductive health and family planning can prevent this from happening .
",
6119,0,," , international women 's health program , although evidence is limited the map , men as partners , program in south africa showcases the positive effect of including men .
",
6120,0,," the intervention is changing men 's attitude and behaviors .
",
6121,0,," by including men fast action can be taken to control the size , and growth , of families .
",
6122,0,," the patriarchal power structures mean men have a key voice in household decisions .
",
6123,0,," therefore the involvement of men in family planning is enabling perceptions of what the family should be to change .
",
6124,0,," the cost of raising a family is realized , and intervening methods are being used to have fewer children .
",
6125,0,," family planning means planning how one can cope with having a child -- mentally , emotionally , financially , and physically , and sensitizing couples as to what kind of life standard they want .
",
6126,0,," with the young generation of ugandans a new culture of a smaller family can emerge .
",
6127,0,," men often have limited knowledge about family planning so it is necessary that they are included in learning and the transfer of knowledge , kaida et al  .
",
6128,0,," when both partners are knowledgeable and involved family planning is far more likely to become a reality .
",
6129,0,," the health of the leader of the state is an issue that the people and the media inevitably want to know about .
",
6130,0,," there will always be a lot of interest in it .
",
6131,0,," occasionally this can be played by the administration as with kissinger saying he was ill and using time to fly to beijing to arrange for nixon 's visit without press attention .
",
6132,0,," but most of the time keeping things from the press is purely negative ; it drives rumors .
",
6133,0,," the health and fitness of a leader is a vital issue when choosing a leader ; the electorate deserves to know if they are likely to serve out their term .
",
6134,0,," when health conditions are hidden from the people they may mistakenly elect a leader who is unable to serve a full term or is at times not in control of the country .
",
6135,0,," there would be little point in voting for a leader who will often not truely be in charge of the country , if voters are told it becomes their choice whether this is a problem .
",
6136,0,," transparency in terms of clear , accurate and up-to-date information is necessary for the electorate to judge the fitness of a leader which is a necessary precondition for election .
",
6137,0,," in a democracy a leader needs to be accountable , he can only be accountable if the elctorate knows such vital information .
",
6138,1,,"with the prevalence of hiv, both worldwide and across africa, concern has been raised over what can provide appropriate solutions.
",
6139,1,," in 2011,million people were living with hiv globally; with rates of hiv in sub-saharan africa accounting for 69% of the total adult population living with hiv (gho, 2013).
",
6140,1,," the identification of the burden hiv/aids has on livelihoods, health systems, and economy, placed the effective control of hiv/aids on the millenium development goals agenda.
",
6141,1,," previous debates and concern have drawn upon a range of concerns from medical intervention to contraceptive distribution.
",
6142,1,," the 17th international conference on aids and sexually transmitted infections in africa, based in south africa, worked to mobilise response and solutions to reach a target of zero people living with hiv.
",
6143,1,," a key focus was placed on the provision of hiv treatment; and crucial recognition was raised on a particular group, sex workers.
",
6144,1,," unsafe sex work accounts for 15% of hiv amongst women (pruss-ustun et al, 2013).
",
6145,1,," however, despite being a “vulnerable” group, their inclusion in treatment and prevention solutions has remained marginalised within the policy discourse and practice.
",
6146,1,," sex workers have often been criminalised, driving it underground.
",
6147,1,," in focusing on sex workers and the measures to combat hiv/aids this debate explores who are sex workers, where they are, why do they adopt such practices, and what relationship do they have to the prevalence of hiv/aids.
",
6148,1,," sex work is broadly defined as the act of selling sex.
",
6149,1,," across africa the legality of sex work varies - for example prostitution is defined as illegal in a majority of african nation-states.
",
6150,1,," however, the question remains as to what can be used to effectively reduce, and combat, hiv/aids amongst sex workers?
",
6151,1,,"regional variations remain in hiv/aids across africa.
",
6152,1,," percentages range from 0.7% (among 15-49 year olds) in senegal to 17.3% in south africa (who, 2011): what are the causes of variation?
",
6153,1,," is the issue one of law and legality, whereby sex work needs to be made illegal to discourage such occupations; or does this result in a loss of rights and human dignity?
",
6154,1,," do sex workers need support to exit the precarious employment?
",
6155,1,," this focuses on both issues around supply and demand of sex workers; the potential limits of legal change in resolving the pandemic; and the politics involved with being a sex worker.
",
6156,1,," ultimately is the undp (2013) right to propose legal frameworks as requirements to prevent hiv/aids and vulnerability?
",
6157,1,," is it a question of theory versus practice?
",
6158,0,," sex workers remain stigmatised across africa .
",
6159,0,," legalising sex work enables the practice to be decriminalised , and rights provided .
",
6160,0,," being a sex worker where it is illegal creates additional risks and vulnerabilities .
",
6161,0,," reports from south africa show that criminalizing sex workers makes them more likely to be victims of inhuman police action .
",
6162,0,," sex workers are raped , abused , and harassed .
",
6163,0,," the risk of unsafe sex is therefore practiced outside of their occupation as no legal rights are provided .
",
6164,0,," legalising , and subsequently decriminalising , sex work will first , tackle corrupt police soliciting sex .
",
6165,0,," secondly , a new rights framework is provided .
",
6166,0,," sex workers are able to fight exploitation and claim rights for protection by prosecuting perpetrators if raped or abused .
",
6167,0,," sex work will continue either way - but legalising it means legal safety , protection , and negotiation , is provided .
",
6168,0,," sex work is employment , and therefore requires legal protection .
",
6169,0,," it remains the government responsibility to provide security for their productive workforce and enable them to organise , and unionise .
",
6170,0,," sex work empowers women and men by providing a means of income , independence and control over sexual practices , and flexible employment .
",
6171,0,," a legal framework will enable sex workers to be able to unionise .
",
6172,0,," unions remain a source of power in politics .
",
6173,0,," recognising sex work as legitimate work enables positive intervention .
",
6174,0,," firstly , taxes can be collected by the state ; and social security schemes established .
",
6175,0,," pensions can be set up and a safety-net for if workers become ill and or infected provided .
",
6176,0,," sex workers will be recognised as citizens , contributing to national wealth .
",
6177,0,," secondly , labour laws - such as minimal wages , hours , and safety , can be implemented .
",
6178,0,," labour laws are a means of regulating conditions of employment and workplaces preventing exploitation .
",
6179,0,," legalising sex work will enable regulation .
",
6180,0,," responsive laws can promote safe sex practices and enable access to health services .
",
6181,0,," firstly , sex workers fear asking for health assistance , and treatment in public services , due to the illegal and criminalised nature of sex work .
",
6182,0,," who  predictedinsex workers received adequate hiv prevention ; and less are able to access additional health services .
",
6183,0,," access is limited due to the criminalised status , but also cost of treatment and transport , inconvenient opening hours , and humiliation .
",
6184,0,," secondly , the illegal nature of sex work has been attached to safe-practice tools .
",
6185,0,," in namibia , where prostitution remains commonly practiced but illegal , the criminalisation of accessing condoms enhances vulnerabilities .
",
6186,0,," following stop and searches by the police% of sex workers reported their condoms were destroyed , osf  .
",
6187,0,," within the% ,% subsequently had unprotected sex .
",
6188,0,," being defined as illegal puts workers at greater risk .
",
6189,0,," through legalisation sex workers can access tests and openly seek treatment , care and support .
",
6190,0,," by including sex workers under a legal framework regulatory rules can be imposed on who enters the profession , such as is found in senegal .
",
6191,0,," the introduction of senegal 's identity card means frequent health checks are required upon registration to be a prostitute .
",
6192,0,," additionally , the use of children and youths within the sex industry can be controlled .
",
6193,0,," global estimations of hiv/aids show young people are at highest risk .
",
6194,0,," the undp  called for a legal framework able to ensure the protection of children and youths .
",
6195,0,," regulation and monitoring is the only way to do so .
",
6196,0,," engaging in sex work is a choice ; a reflection of individual agency , whereby control is granted over their own body .
",
6197,0,," one has the right to choose how they use their body ; therefore legalising sex work legitimising a woman 's , or man 's , right over their body and sexuality .
",
6198,1,,"lesotho is a small country of just over 30,355 km2 (12,727 sq. mi) in size with a population slightly over two million which is landlocked and completely surrounded by south africa, a much bigger countrytimes the size andtimes its population.
",
6199,1,," this unusual situation of a country having no access to the sea and being completely surrounded by another country is a result of south africa and lesotho’s colonial history.
",
6200,1,,"basutoland, as the current lesotho was known was threatened from the 1830s by the boers, originally dutch colonists in south africa though no longer under dutch control, who claimed territory in the region.
",
6201,1,," the british in charge of cape colony, the colony that would later go on to be south africa, in response made a treaty with basotho recognising them as an ally in 1843.
",
6202,1,," while anglo basotho relations were briefly upset by a brief war inthey were soon brought back together after the boers declared the orange free state.
",
6203,1,," hostilities broke out inwith the boers besieging thaba bosiu a mountain stronghold that acted as the capital.
",
6204,1,," king moshoeshoe appealed to the british who agreed to make the country a british protectorate.
",
6205,1,," unlike the rest of south africa therefore the region was brought under british control by diplomatic agreement, not conflict or settlement.
",
6206,1,," the territory was ruled from cape colony, but mismanagement resulted in a rebellion in 1880-1 and an appeal for direct rule from london which was accepted in 1884.
",
6207,1,,"  this has meant that lesotho and south africa despite both being controlled by the british were run separately.
",
6208,1,," in turn this meant that when south africa became a dominion inand was then granted equality between the dominions and britain inlesotho remained separate and under british, not south african control.
",
6209,1,," when independence came inlesotho therefore became an independent country.
",
6210,1,,"key terms:annexation (latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous).
",
6211,1,," usually, it is implied that the territory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size.
",
6212,1,," the model of how the annexation is going to take place is not necessarily relevant to the debate but both parts can agree it will happen after a sovereign referendum by the people of lesotho.
",
6213,1,," moreover, this debate will settle if the annexation is in favor of both countries and their population.
",
6214,1,,"mosotho is the demonym when referring to a single person from lesotho while when talking about more than one person the word used is basotho.
",
6215,0,," for the basotho in a landlocked country the free movement of their people is a right that is in large part dependent on the south african , sa , government rather their own national one .
",
6216,0,," its importance is shown by% of border crossings into south africa being from lesotho .
",
6217,0,," acknowledging the fact that lesotho is an enclave state surrounded by sa , the ability of people to move freely depends on whether they are allowed to enter sa or not .
",
6218,0,," there is corruption at border posts and the number of crossings results in long queues and slow service ;% of border crossers experience problems .
",
6219,0,," this is sometimes made even more difficult by sa government actions as before the world cup inwhen border restrictions were tightened making it almost impossible for basotho to leave their country .
",
6220,0,," this happened due to the detention of several lesotho nationals after a spate of criminal activities along the border .
",
6221,0,," the same situation applies to trade .
",
6222,0,," lesotho is dependent on the trade with south africa , even for goods that come from beyond south africa as lesotho has no port of its own most goods will have to be transported through south africa .
",
6223,0,," this dependency is rising .
",
6224,0,," in, lesotho produced% of the cereals it consumed .
",
6225,0,," now it imports% .
",
6226,0,," annexation would eliminate these borders boosting trade between the countries , helping to make both richer .
",
6227,0,," in the best interest of basotho is to be able to control and be listened to by the entity that is metaphorically and literally feeding them .
",
6228,0,," the reason why moshoeshoe , the leader of lesotho , wished to become a british protectorate was because of the boers of the orange free state was trying to take their land .
",
6229,0,," in, when the kingdom of lesotho gained its independence from britain , it remained separate from sa as it had been a separate colony .
",
6230,0,," lesotho was under direct rule while south africa was a dominion .
",
6231,0,," there was no incentive to change at the point of independence because sa was ruled by the apartheid regime .
",
6232,0,," lesotho was a strong public opponent of the regime and granted a number of sa refugees ' political asylum .
",
6233,0,," the african national congress , the ruling party in sa since, was founded in lesotho .
",
6234,0,," moreover , during the struggle against apartheid , the anc 's armed wing organized its guerilla units from the enclave .
",
6235,0,," we can firmly say that lesotho vas a very important actor in a post-apartheid sa , but the times have changed .
",
6236,0,," the anc is now in power in south africa and sa and lesotho are closer together than ever before .
",
6237,0,," with about% of basotho people living below the international poverty line , lesotho needs urgent help both from the economic and social perspective .
",
6238,0,," a third of the population is infected with hiv and in urban areas ; about% of the women underhave the virus .
",
6239,0,," there is a major lack of funding and corruption in the system is halting any progress .
",
6240,0,," the kingdom of lesotho is clearly unable to deal with its issues and should be annexed by sa .
",
6241,0,," annexation is the only way in which the sa government is going to care about this enclave territory .
",
6242,0,," give basotho citizenship and the right to vote in elections and they will be taken into consideration .
",
6243,0,," give sa the power to control and they will assume the responsibility for pulling the basotho out of poverty , giving them a better social system and a country in which they can thrive .
",
6244,0,," a simple look at the gdp per capita of each state shows the potential benefit to lesotho and ability of sa to deliver .
",
6245,0,," while lesotho is stable at $ 1,700 per capita , sa has a gdp of $ 10,700 per person .
",
6246,0,," only by giving them full responsibility of the territory , the sa government is going to step in and make the necessary change .
",
6247,0,," bringing south africa and lesotho will benefit sa on the global stage .
",
6248,0,," the move would be one to provide aid to a smaller state and provide stability .
",
6249,0,," the dire conditions for the basotho people are acknowledged by the un and the africa union .
",
6250,0,," firstly , sa , by the annexation of lesotho , will prove good intentions in creating a sustainable sub-saharan africa .
",
6251,0,," this will ultimately create a better image and a greater influence in the region if they choose to respond positively to the people 's charter movement in lesotho , a social structure pleading for annexation .
",
6252,0,," the movement , driven by trade unions , has collected 30,000 signatures in favor of their goal and is rising in popularity .
",
6253,0,," secondly the annexation will provide a boost for the south african development community and south african customs union by demonstrating the willingness of south africa to integrate with poorer neighbours and take on some of the responsibility for them .
",
6254,1,,"the international criminal court (icc) began in 2002, formed under the rome statute  to try the most serious of war crimes when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves.
",
6255,1,," the icc is an independent international organisation, outside of the united nations system, and runs on funding from state parties.
",
6256,1,," in order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the icc needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the united nations security council (being made up by the us, france, russia, china and the uk), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves.
",
6257,1,," currently, every referral to the court except one (and the only conviction to date) has been african.
",
6258,1,," the african union (au) has consistently criticized a ‘bias’ within the icc unfairly targeting african countries.
",
6259,1,," in januarythe organisation sent a letter to the icc highlighting “processes and procedures of the icc” one of the criticisms is the icc acts “without garnering the cooperation necessary to ensure the integrity of the proceedings”.
",
6260,1,," in individual statements african governments go further; ethiopia’s foreign minister tedros adhanom has said the icc’s “unfair treatment of africa and africans leaves much to be desired” and his kenyan counterpart amina mohamed accuses the icc of “treating us like toddlers”.
",
6261,1,," so the question becomes: is the icc biased against africa?
",
6262,0,,"    all of the twenty-four people currently indicted are african .
",
6263,0,," of the fifteen cases currently sitting before the court , all are african .
",
6264,0,," this in and of itself points to a large disparity between africa and the rest of the world .
",
6265,0,," it is also not at all true that africa is the only place worthy of investigation -- atrocities have occurred in the middle east , kosovo , chechnya , sri lanka and north korea , among others since the inception of the court .
",
6266,0,," this is clearly because these other cases have powerful backers in the form of permanent security council members .
",
6267,0,," the only conclusion to be drawn is that the icc feels more comfortable targeting africa then other regions where it is likely to run into opposition from powerful members of the international community .
",
6268,0,," africa and its leaders are treated far more contemptuously by the court .
",
6269,0,," the prospect of prosecuting barak obama for the killing of civilians by drones which amnesty international has suggested amount to war crimes or george w. bush for war crimes in iraq and afghanistan is remote -- yet omar al-bashir and uhuru kenyatta have both been indicted as sitting leaders .
",
6270,0,," the icc will only prosecute if those who have committed war crimes are not going to be prosecuted locally but this is as much the case for western leaders as african ones .
",
6271,0,," this points clearly to the icc proselytizing what is ` right ' and ` wrong ' to africans but not to other leaders -- treating these leaders less respectfully and blatantly undermining african nations sovereignty in a way they would not , or would dare not , for others .
",
6272,0,," the icc can only investigate situations that are referred to it by either the host country , or the security council .
",
6273,0,," a power also exists for the prosecutor to seek investigation , though this has as yet only been used twice .
",
6274,0,," as such , most atrocities that occur across the world are shielded from prosecution because such a prosecution would be against the interests of a member security council .
",
6275,0,," leaders do not seem to be brought for investigation until they offend the west ; charles taylor was not prosecuted until he had a falling out with the usa , despite their soft support for him in overthrowing the doe regime .
",
6276,0,," another case in point is uganda where the lord 's resistance army has been charged , but not the pro-us government forces , despite evidence existing they have also committed crimes .
",
6277,0,," it is clear then that the icc makes decisions by broad external factors , which biases it against africa which does not have any countries on the unsc or any patrons sitting on the council .
",
6278,1,,"in many western countries, the topic of illegal immigrants sits high on the political agenda.
",
6279,1,," this is the result of an increase in illegal immigrants residing in these countries, and the internal tensions that arise from these movements.
",
6280,1,,"as a response, countries such as the us, canada and the eu have adopted repatriation policies for illegal immigrants.
",
6281,1,," the policies are focused on voluntary repatriation, where an illegal immigrant gets the chance to decide for themselves to return to their country of origin, whilst receiving counselling aid and a free flight back.
",
6282,1,," if this fails, involuntary repatriation can be considered1.
",
6283,1,," proponents of repatriation insist a hard stance is necessary to deter future immigrants and reduce criminal activity.
",
6284,1,," opponents maintain however that the threat is overblown and that is both more expensive and dangerous to repatriate than to integrate illegal immigrants.
",
6285,1,,"this centres around the principles and practicalities of repatriating these immigrants.
",
6286,0,," the motion of repatriating 'all' illegal immigrants in itself implies the inclusion of involuntary repatriation, since there are bound to be illegal immigrants that do not want to go back to their home country.
",
6287,0,,"the only way to stop the problem of illegal immigration is to take a hard-line stance and adopt policies of repatriation .
",
6288,0,," this means that illegal immigrants , after it has been proven through a fair hearing that they have no legitimate reason to stay , will be granted a period of voluntary repatriation , where they receive counselling and help to return to their country .
",
6289,0,," if this does not work , and the illegal immigrant wants to stay , he or she will forced to repatriate .
",
6290,0,," repatriation is needed because illegal immigrants are residing in a country which is different from their country of origin , without fulfilling the legal requirements to do so .
",
6291,0,," they also do not make the same contributions to the state as other people do , such as paying taxes .
",
6292,0,," this means that illegal immigrants are actively harming the legal system , the citizens of the country and legal immigrants .
",
6293,0,," at the same time , the number of illegal immigrants is rising every year , with an estimated 11.5-12 million illegal immigrants living in the us alone1 .
",
6294,0,," these kind of numbers show that the rules on immigration need to come with tough sanctions to ensure that they are not exploited or broken in the future .
",
6295,0,," repatriation is necessary because it targets successful illegal immigrants and ensures a comprehensive immigration policy that aims to reduce illegal immigration .
",
6296,0,," what this policy of repatriation will do , is that it firstly will reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the country , which will lead to a decline of harms caused by them .
",
6297,0,," secondly , it will act as a strong deterrence for future immigrants .
",
6298,0,," repatriation sends a message to potential illegal migrants that their presence in the country will not be tolerated and that any attempt to stay in the country illegally will be unsuccessful .
",
6299,0,," repatriating illegal immigrants would lead to fewer opportunities for criminal networks to gain entry to the country .
",
6300,0,," illegal immigration is linked to dangerous criminal activity such as people and drug trafficking , terrorism and the sex trade .
",
6301,0,," an estimated000 victims of human trafficking live in industrialized countries , of whom% are forced into commercial sexual exploitation , mostly women and girls1 .
",
6302,0,," this is both dangerous for those involved in illegal immigration but also increases the criminal activity in a country , putting lawful residents at risk .
",
6303,0,," the state also has a duty to protect its citizens from the harms associated with illegal immigration .
",
6304,0,," illegal immigration fuels dangerous industries such as prostitution and the drug trade , repatriating illegal immigrants cuts off a vital source of labour for these industries and could contribute to the eradication of these industries .
",
6305,0,," illegal immigrants cost the state in money , time and resources .
",
6306,0,," it is difficult to give an accurate number on the cost of illegal immigrants for the rest of the population , the federation for american immigration reform , fair , has come up with numbers as high as $ 1,183 per household in the state of california1 , but they are likely to put a strain on resources by not paying taxes whilst demanding social services such as healthcare and education .
",
6307,0,," as a result , they take taxpayer 's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state .
",
6308,0,," moreover , illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions .
",
6309,0,," this is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down .
",
6310,0,," removing the illegal workforce would increase the number of jobs available to lawful residents and force employers to pay fair wages and provide safe working conditions .
",
6311,0,," failing to remove illegal immigrants undermines public confidence in the government and its migration policy .
",
6312,0,," in the uk , opposition leader ed milliband has acknowledged that labour had lost trust in the south by underestimating the number of illegal immigrants and the impact they would have on people 's wages1 .
",
6313,0,," people believe that allowing those who have no right to remain in the country to stay on means the whole immigration system is broken .
",
6314,0,," legitimate migrants such as refugees , students and those with visas for work will be lumped together with illegal immigrants , and calls will grow for all forms of migration to be restricted .
",
6315,0,," populist feeling may also be inflamed against ethnic minorities , with increased social tensions .
",
6316,0,," all states have sovereignty -- the supreme authority within a territory.
",
6317,0,," this includes the supreme authority to decide who should be allowed into and out of the country .
",
6318,0,," illegal immigrants have breached that sovereignty by arriving uninvited and attempting to circumvent checks .
",
6319,0,," these people should be deported in order to maintain the sovereignty of the nation .
",
6320,0,," the united nations recognises the sovereign rights of members when it says `` nothing contained in the present charter shall authorize the united nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state .
",
6321,0,," ``who is allowed to be resident in the state is an internal consideration .
",
6322,1,,"the war in darfur refers to the civil war taking place in darfur, sudan.
",
6323,1,," unlike the second sudanese civil war, this is believed to be an ethnic, rather than a religious war, though it has racial overtones and grew out of the existing sudanese civil war.
",
6324,1,,"the people of darfur occupied an equivocal position in that other conflict.
",
6325,1,," like the southerners they are black.
",
6326,1,," like the northern government and unlike their racial counterparts in the south, they are muslim.
",
6327,1,," they largely sided with the northern forces in the civil war, but as the north moved towards a peace agreement, the darfur tribes increasingly began to resent the neglect which they felt khartoum showed to their influence.
",
6328,1,," in february ofthey rose against the government,rather than making concessions, the sudanese government sent in military forces.
",
6329,1,," one side of the armed conflicts is composed mainly of the sudanese military and the janjaweed, a sudanese militia group recruited mostly from the afro-arab abbala tribes of the northern rizeigat region in sudan.
",
6330,1,," these tribes are mainly camel-herding nomads.
",
6331,1,," the other side is composed of rebel groups, notably the sudan liberation movement/army and the justice and equality movement, recruited primarily from the non-arab fur, zaghawa, and masalit ethnic groups.
",
6332,1,," the sudanese government, while publicly denying that it supports the janjaweed, is accused of providing financial assistance to the militia, and of participating in joint attacks targeting civilians.complicating matters is a history of conflict between the nomadic abbala, and the historically settled zaghawa and masalit, which has embittered the conflict and increased the impression that if the genocide is not the policy of khartoum it may well be that of its proxies.
",
6333,1,,"western intervention is harder than it may seem.
",
6334,1,," for one thing, its unclear if the sudanese government could gain control of the situation even if it wished to.
",
6335,1,," having armed the janaweed, any effort to crush them would likely face khartoum with a two-front war.
",
6336,1,," furthermore, darfur is isolated, and there are no clear ways to support an international force even with sudanese support.
",
6337,1,," with official opposition it might well have been impossible.
",
6338,1,,"the darfur conflict is essentially over for the moment at least.
",
6339,1,," a darful peace agreement was drawn up by mediators at the doha peace forum in 2011.
",
6340,1,," this was signed by the government of sudan and the liberation and justice movement onjuly 2011.
",
6341,1,," this means that this debate is really a post-mortem about whether more should have been done more.
",
6342,1,," there is unlikely to be any debates about what the united states should do in darfur however it may be a useful example for similar cases in the future.
",
6343,0,," the violence that occurred in the darfur region of western sudan since, approached genocide proportions with the death toll estimated between 300,000 and 500,000 out of a population of a little over a million and a half .
",
6344,0,," by having called the events a genocide and then failed the west discredited itself , both as a moral force , showing it cared more about se europe than it did africa , and indicated to dictators that they have no reason to fear a western response in the future .
",
6345,0,," perhaps as damaging as the humanitarian consequences of the failure to intervene is the message it sent to other leaders considering solving their political and ethnic problems in a similar manner to khartoum .
",
6346,0,," rather than deterring them from following in bashir 's footsteps , the west by doing nothing , gave the impression that bashir survived not through his own efforts , but because china protected him .
",
6347,0,," given the rapid expansion of chinese influence around in africa , this makes accepting chinese investment instead of western investment vastly more attractive because in addition to the economic benefits , it is now perceived as buying chinese political cover .
",
6348,0,," in turn , this increasing interest in seeking out chinese political cover will lead to more states being willing to imitate bashir in the future , safe the knowledge that they will not be bombed .
",
6349,0,," while sudan has been more cooperative in recent years against al-quada , it continues to harbour islamic extremist groups responsible for attacks in egypt and saudi arabia .
",
6350,0,," combined with the conflict in darfur there was a pressing case for regime change , and reason to think sudan 's neighbours would be open and supportive of the idea as well .
",
6351,0,," furthermore , the tendency for resistance forces to base themselves in these refugee camps , threatened and continues to threaten to spread the war into these regions , either igniting the north-south civil war in sudan , or destabilizing chad 's government .
",
6352,1,,"cape verde is an archipelago nation with a population of around half a million people 500km off the coast of west africa.
",
6353,1,," formerly a portuguese colony, it gained independence from portugal in- the year after the collapse of the salazar dictatorship in portugal.
",
6354,1,," the independence movement, founded by amilcar cabral, a pan-africanist, was linked to independence campaigns elsewhere in africa, such as that of guinea-bissau.
",
6355,1,," links between the two nations however weakened after guinea-bissau’scoup.
",
6356,1,," cape verde has had democratic elections since 1991, and is listed as having top scores and status as a ""model for political rights and civil liberties in africa"" according to freedom house.
",
6357,1,," other islands groups off the coast of north-west africa include the azores and madeira, which remain part of portugal, and the canary islands, which are an integral part of spain.
",
6358,1,,"cape verde has recently attempted to position itself towards europe (an eu membership bid was mooted in 2005), including a “special partnership” with the european union which increases “cooperation at a political level and on security, regional integration, the knowledge-based society and poverty alleviation.”
",
6359,1,,"  if cape verde’s government is set on integration in to the european sphere, the ultimate goal would be membership of the european union, the tight knit political and economic organization which containsnations, covering much of the continent.
",
6360,1,," indeed, cape verde has changed its national flag to one featuring a ring of stars not dissimilar to that of the european union.
",
6361,1,," cape verde's currency, the escudo, is pegged to the euro.
",
6362,1,,"cape verde is not the only nation separated from the main european continent which is a part of, or has attempted to join european organisations.
",
6363,1,," morocco applied to join the european union in 1987, but was rejected, citing geographical reasons.
",
6364,1,," the council of europe counts azerbaijan, in central asia, as one of its members.
",
6365,1,," on a sporting level, israel’s national football and rugby teams have competed in european competitions for political reasons, the state not being formally recognised by many other nations in asia.
",
6366,1,," israel has been suggested as an eu member too, although a wide variety of issues, including the israeli-palestinian conflict make membership unlikely.
",
6367,0,," cape verde is not a good fit with the much of the history of africa .
",
6368,0,," it has been joined at the hip with europe , if other things had gone other ways this debate would not be happening as the islands could have remained an integral part of portugal as with madeira and the azores .
",
6369,0,," not all cape verdeans do consider themselves to be africans .
",
6370,0,," cape verde culturally and historically has more in common with europe .
",
6371,0,," it has a longer standing relationship with a european state than other african nations that were colonized ; it was first settled by the portuguese inand unlike much of africa it was uninhabited before europeans arrived .
",
6372,0,," it history has therefore been one that is linked to europe not africa .
",
6373,0,," a future orientated towards europe would not have to be culturally exclusive .
",
6374,0,," cape verde would not be giving up its independence , any more than ireland gave up its independence by becoming part of the european union .
",
6375,0,," cape verde would still be free to explore cultural and historical links with africa .
",
6376,0,," cape verde does n't dislike west africa -- it just has no real economic connection to the region .
",
6377,0,," cape verde 's main economic partners are in europe , with over half of imports coming from portugal and the netherlands , and more than three quarters of exports going to spain and portugal together .
",
6378,0,," if cape verde were to join the eu internal market , as discussed , it would give cape verdean exports total unfettered access to the whole market and integrate them in to the systems of standards .
",
6379,0,," joining would mean lower tariffs so in turn cape verde goods being exported would be cheaper in their main european market so boosting exports while imports would be cheaper for consumers in cape verde meaning the residents are able to buy more .
",
6380,1,," africa is a continent with great economic potential.
",
6381,1,," foreign investors are competing to enter the market and invest.
",
6382,1,," that potential however is only in part met as a result of the limited role of women in the economy.
",
6383,1,,"currently one of the most important economic sectors in africa is agriculture.
",
6384,1,," it accounts for more than 32% of africa’s gdp and it accounts for around 65% of africa’s employment.
",
6385,1,," as the economy develops this preponderance is likely to decline as it has done in other countries as they develop but agriculture will still remain important for reducing famine and malnutrition.
",
6386,1,,"the majority of the people working in the field are women.
",
6387,1,," according to the un food and agriculture organization, women in africa are responsible for 70% of crop production, 50% of animal husbandry and 60% of marketing.
",
6388,1,," women undertake nearly 100% of food processing activities, in addition to child care and other responsibilities in households.
",
6389,1,,"agriculture both illustrates how women are vital to african future prosperity and some of the problems along the road to prosperity.
",
6390,1,," women in africa have few rights; they can seldom own land, although they are working it, they cannot take loans from banks in order to invest, and many of them lack a basic education.
",
6391,1,," women own less than 1% of the african continent’s landmass.
",
6392,1,," only 51% of females over the age ofin africa are able to read and write, compared to 67% men.
",
6393,1,," it is estimated that this inequality reduces africa’s annual per capita growth by 0.8%.
",
6394,1,," if this growth had taken place africa’s economies would have doubled over the lastyears.
",
6395,1,,"women, therefore, might be considered to be key to africa’s economic future.
",
6396,1,," that is if the continent can overcome these inequalities to provide women with the necessary training, with rights and liberties to move freely in the market, to run their own businesses and make their own economic decisions.
",
6397,1,," women represent a pool of untapped labour.
",
6398,1,," one of the biggest mistakes to be made in any economy is to misuse one’s factors of production.
",
6399,1,," time has come for africa to start integrating women into the economy and to start maximizing their potential as future entrepreneurs.
",
6400,0,,"   it sounds dramatic , but when more than% percent of the agricultural labor force of africa is represented by women , and that sector is a third of gdp , one can say that women really are the backbone of africa 's economy .
",
6401,0,," but the sector does not reach its full potential .
",
6402,0,," women do most of the work but hold none of the profit ; they can not innovate and receive salaries up to% less than men .
",
6403,0,," this is because they can not own land , they can not take loans , and therefore can not invest to increase profits .
",
6404,0,," the way to make women key to africa 's future therefore is to provide them with rights to their land .
",
6405,0,," this will provide women with an asset that can be used to obtain loans to increase productivity .
",
6406,0,," the food and agriculture organisation argues `` if women had the same access to productive resources as men , they could increase yields on their farms by--percent .
",
6407,0,," this could raise total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 --percent , which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by--percent . ''
",
6408,0,," the bottom line is that women work hard but their work is not recognised and potential not realised .
",
6409,0,," what is true in agriculture is even truer in other sectors where women do not make up the majority of workers where the simple lack of female workers demonstrates wasted potential .
",
6410,0,," the inefficient use of resources reduces the growth of the economy .
",
6411,0,," where women in africa are treated more as equals and are being given political power there are benefits for the economy .
",
6412,0,," africa is already surging economically without of the world 's ten fastest growing economies in the past decade being a part of sub-saharan africa .
",
6413,0,," while some of the fastest growing economies are simply as a result of natural resource exploitation some are also countries that have given much more influence to women .
",
6414,0,," 56 % of rwanda 's parliamentarians are women .
",
6415,0,," the country 's economy is growing ; its poverty rate has dropped from% to% inand economic growth is expected to reach up to% by.
",
6416,0,," women become the driving force of the socio-economic development after thegenocide with many taking on leadership roles in their communities .
",
6417,0,," in liberia , since ellen johnson sirleaf took the presidency seat on january, notable reforms have been implemented in the country to boot the economy , and with visible results .
",
6418,0,," liberia 's gdp has grown from 4.6 % into 7.7 % by the end of.
",
6419,0,," men in africa on the other hand have often lead their countries into war , conflict , discord , and the resulting slower economic growth .
",
6420,0,," men fight leaving women behind to tend the household and care for the family .
",
6421,0,," giving women a greater voice helps encourage longer term thinking and discourages conflict , one of the main reasons for africa 's plight in the second half of the 20th century .
",
6422,0,," the feminisation of politics has been identified by stephen pinker as one of the causes for a decline in conflict .
",
6423,0,," when peace brings economic growth women will deserve an outsize share of the credit .
",
6424,0,," there is great potential in educating african women .
",
6425,0,," two out of three illiterate africans are women .
",
6426,0,," inthe countries with the highest illiteracy rates in women are burkina faso with a staggering 91.1 % , sierra leone with 88.7 % , guinea with 86.6 % and chad with 82.1 % of women illiterate .
",
6427,0,," the situation is however improving .
",
6428,0,," women are starting to reach their educational potential : bythe illiteracy rate among female youth , 15-24 , had dropped to% in sierra leone ,% in guinea and% in chad .
",
6429,0,," women in africa are becoming much better educated .
",
6430,0,," this means they are much more likely to be able to reach their full potential in the economy .
",
6431,0,," education provides opportunities as educated women will be better able to work in the manufacturing or services sectors .
",
6432,0,," they will also be much more capable of setting up and running their own businesses or organisations .
",
6433,0,," as a more educated cohort of women enters the workforce they will have a much greater effect on the economy than women have had in the past .
",
6434,1,,"war creates unexpected alliances, and the war on terrorism gave a good opportunity for growing closeness between the united states and russia.
",
6435,1,," for the first time, a chance existed to forge deep strategic, economic, and cultural ties between these former enemies.
",
6436,1,," and for the first time since the end of world war ii, russia and the united states have a common enemy: international terrorism.
",
6437,1,," both countries are interested in the reduction of nuclear weapons and in making each other’s military policies transparent.
",
6438,1,," the usa and newly capitalist russia will also benefit greatly from broader economic cooperation.
",
6439,1,," expressions of common interest have included agreements inandon cutting nuclear arsenals deeply, cooperation in dealing with iran's own nuclear programme, and improved relations under presidents medvedev and obama fromonwards.
",
6440,1,," yet alongside these russia's suspicions of america have increased as nato expanded, the us withdrew from theanti-missile treaty, nato intervened to support kosovan independence, american wars in iraq and afghanistan continued, and political upheavals in former soviet states such as ukraine and kirgizstan threatened russia's neighbourhood policy.
",
6441,1,," at the same time, russia's return to authoritarian rule under putin, with a brief interlude under medvedev, worries the united states, many claimed their worries are confirmed by russian intervention in pro-american georgia inand by the expulsion of a spying ring from the united states in 2010.
",
6442,1,,"in response to this decline in relations at the end of george w. bush’s presidency barak obama launched a reset of relations.
",
6443,1,," the current russian president dmitry medvedev although often seen as being subordinate to putin, now the prime minister, is also seen as someone that the west can do business with.
",
6444,1,," russia however inalong with china it was a founding member of the shanghai cooperation organisation.
",
6445,1,," thus, russian-american relations are much more complicated under the surface than they seem to be ostensibly.
",
6446,0,," inpresident obama stated `` i believe that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century , americans and russians share common interests that form a basis for cooperation . ''
",
6447,0,," this makes the real question ` how to cooperate ' rather that whether there should be cooperation .
",
6448,0,," military transparency , particularly on nuclear weapons is necessary .
",
6449,0,," `` russia and the united states matter to one another , and how well or how poorly we manage our interactions matters to the rest of the world .
",
6450,0,," the two of us control more than% of the world 's nuclear weapons , and our leadership can do more than anyone else 's to help secure nuclear material globally and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons . ''
",
6451,0,," this continued cooperation on nuclear issues in particular has been demonstrated with the signing of the ` new start ' treaty on 8th april.
",
6452,0,," there are many other areas where cooperation between the america and russia is vital as well .
",
6453,0,," as is demonstrated by the geopolitical situation `` russia sits astride europe , asia and the broader middle east -- three regions whose future will shape american interests for many years to come .
",
6454,0,," and in an era in which common challenges '' so cooperation is necessary for the united states , but also for russia as it would not want the us acting without its cooperation .
",
6455,0,," according to undersecretary of state burns there are also many issues `` non-proliferation , climate change , energy security , the struggle against terrorism , and many more -- demand common action more than at any other period in human history , the united states and russia have a lot more to gain by working together than by working apart . ''
",
6456,0,," september 11th brought a change in how the united states dealt with the autocratic rulers of central asia , bringing policy more into line with moscow 's interests .
",
6457,0,," the us changed from promoting democracy in the region to trying to keep the region stable by supporting the incumbent regimes .
",
6458,0,," for example uzbekistan was given us political , military and economic support despite human rights violations .
",
6459,0,," there were also secondary us interests that were not related to terrorism such as attempting to limit the production of drugs and the corruption this causes .
",
6460,0,," president putin recognised that `` terrorism and drugs are absolutely kindred phenomena . ''
",
6461,0,," with russia 's immense drug problems `` we have a conspicuous growth of the share of highly concentrated drugs , and in the first place afghan heroin '' the promotion of `` peace and stability to afghanistan '' and the promised aid to `` rebuild afghanistan and the region economically , '' were also recognised by george bush as us interests in the region .
",
6462,0,," there has therefore in the aftermath of 9/11 been a dovetailing of interests in central asia and in particular afghanistan and on the war on drugs .
",
6463,0,," a shared experience of terrorism means both have long term reasons to cooperate against it .
",
6464,0,," russia already had experience with terrorism with a string of bombings in the summer ofwhich the russian government blamed on the chechans .
",
6465,0,," as a result of this on-going chechen terrorism the russian government was keen to cooperate in any counter terrorist effort there may be .
",
6466,0,," russian officials such as sergey ordzhonikidze spoke of the grief they shared with the american people `` the hearts of russians who know first-hand what terrorism is like are also filled with grief for all those who fell victim to terrorism in other parts of the planet . ''
",
6467,0,," president putin himself agreed with this immediately after the 9/11 attacks `` , russia is , deeply shocked by the reports of the tragic events that occurred today in the united states .
",
6468,0,," the barbaric terrorist attacks against innocent people evoked the anger and indignation of the russian people . ''
",
6469,0,," both the terrorists who had been attacking russia and the 9/11 attackers were motivated by an extremist version of islam , this gives both russia and the united states a mutual interest in combating this terrorism wherever it may be occurring .
",
6470,0,," this continues to give both russia and the united states an interest in solving the problems that create terrorism such as the israel-palestinian conflict and keeping the taliban out of power in afghanistan .
",
6471,0,," that both understand the other 's motivations makes this link much stronger .
",
6472,0,," there is a huge potential for economic cooperation between two of the biggest states in the world .
",
6473,0,," russia desperately needs investment and technology to modernize its economy .
",
6474,0,," the usa can offer this and more .
",
6475,0,," it has helped russia to get into the world trade organization , to integrate it into the global economy , put pressure on russian companies to drop their corrupt ways and adopt modern modes of operation .
",
6476,0,," russia also has plenty of chips to bring to the table .
",
6477,0,," pumping seven million barrels a day , russia is second only to the saudis in oil production .
",
6478,0,," the bush team saw russia as a source for crude oil should u.s. relations with saudi arabia deteriorate , this is why at the moscow summit in may  bush and putin launched `` an energy dialogue to strengthen the overall relationship between our countries , and to enhance global energy security , international strategic stability , and regional cooperation . ''
",
6479,0,," the united states has invested whenever it could in russian oil and gas despite the difficulties private companies like yukos have faced with government tax demands .
",
6480,0,," for example in october, exxon mobil announced that the sakhalinproject was profitable and outlined the company 's plans to invest $billion by.
",
6481,1,,"the united kingdom held its first national referendum, or direct-democracy vote, in 1975.
",
6482,1,," this vote confirmed uk membership of the european economic community (eec).
",
6483,1,," since 1975, the eec has evolved into the european union (eu), a political as well as economic coalition of countries that fundamentally alters its member states' sovereignty.
",
6484,1,," the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, the right of parliament to make or unmake any law, has traditionally been the cornerstone of the british political system.
",
6485,1,," but given that eu law now supersedes uk law, proponents of holding a referendum argue that the political system and even the social contract have been fundamentally altered without the permission of uk citizens.1 meanwhile, opponents of the referendum insist that eu membership is too important to gamble on uninformed public opinion and that referendums are inconsistent with the british tradition of representative democracy.
",
6486,1,,"this motion proposes that government should hold a referendum on eu membership and maintain or end membership of the eu dependent upon which option receives the most votes.1 elliott, mark.

",
6489,0,," international journal of constitutional law, volume 2, issue 3, pp 545-627.
",
6490,0,,"the general public will be appeased :% of voters want the vote held .1 mps will fulfil their duty to represent constituent interests by calling the referendum .
",
6491,0,," a contented electorate will be more supportive of government and feel included in political life .
",
6492,0,," not only individuals but also parties will be appeased : the far left and right each feel strongly about this issue .
",
6493,0,," euroskeptic parties like ukip and the bnp have agitated for an in-or-out vote for years , and disguise racism and anti-immigrant sentiment as euroskepticism in the process .
",
6494,0,," a vote either way would settle the issue and make it harder for them to disguise antisocial aspects of their platforms .
",
6495,0,," pro-europeans like the lib dems also want the referendum : leader nick clegg said that `` nothing will do more damage to the pro-european movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide ``by not holding one .
",
6496,0,," both sides of the political spectrum wants this issue definitively settled .
",
6497,0,," once it has been , politicians will be able to redirect focus and work on crucial issues like the economy .
",
6498,0,," parliamentary and logistic precedents indicate that holding a referendum about an issue of sovereignty is practical and practicable .
",
6499,0,," there have been two successfully-held national referendums , one the direct antecedent of this one , theeec vote , and one recently , theav vote .
",
6500,0,," the history of national referendums therefore indicates that they are both constitutional and logistically viable .
",
6501,0,," furthermore , the referendum is legitimized by public desire .
",
6502,0,," a bbc poll inindicated that% would vote ` no ' to eu membership if a referendum was held , a level of dissatisfaction which indicates the need for a public discussion and vote .1 the public deserve to vote in this referendum because it regards a constitutional issue -- sovereignty .
",
6503,0,," beyond constitutionality , referendums maintain democratic society when the public 's views and mps ' clearly misalign , as they do in this case .
",
6504,0,," this vote will also maintain the established precedent of holding referendums on eu issues .
",
6505,0,," if the british people had to be consulted on eec membership , as happened in, they must be consulted on eu membership : the current eu barely resembles the eec that the uk voted to join long ago , but has greatly magnified stature and power .
",
6506,0,," a referendum , regardless of the result , will prove an effective public relations boost for the united kingdom .
",
6507,0,," uk citizens will feel more confident in their government , as some currently see eu membership as an illegitimate breach of the social contract and others argue that the uk is not doing enough to co-operate .
",
6508,0,," europeans also will improve their view of the united kingdom : a `` yes '' vote will minimize the perception of the uk as a foot-dragging , reluctant participant in europe ; a `` no '' vote will be seen to end a half-hearted charade .
",
6509,0,," either way , a more straightforward relationship with europe will minimize uk-europe mistrust , which will benefit each politically and economically .
",
6510,1,,"on the first of julythe rome statute that formed the international criminal court (icc) came into force.
",
6511,1,," the icc was needed to try the most serious war crimes and crimes against humanity when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves but this inevitably means there will be conflicts between the individual sovereignty of nations, and a court that wishes to try their nationals outside of their domestic justice system.
",
6512,1,," the icc as an independent international organisation, outside of the united nations system running on funding from state parties is able to conduct its own investigations, but still needs cooperation from the states parties for the arrest of those who violate international criminal law.
",
6513,1,," in order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the icc needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the united nations security council (being made up by the us, france, russia, china and the uk), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves.
",
6514,1,,"in the case of uhuru kenyatta kenya referred the case to the icc itself.
",
6515,1,," the case was the result of violence after disputed elections inwhich pitted the kikuyu ethnic group’s party the party of national unity lead by mwai kibabi against the orange democratic movement mostly made up of kalenjins and luos with raila odinga as their candidate.
",
6516,1,," odinga’s party believed they had been cheated of the election leading to protest, and violence; an estimatedwere killed and 600,000 fled their homes.
",
6517,1,," those accused of instigating the violence are uhuru kenyatta on the pnu side and william ruto and joshua sang for the odm.
",
6518,1,," kenya conducted an investigation, the waki commission, but the kenyan parliament refused to act on its advice to create a special tribunal so the information from the commission was passed to the icc in july 2009.
",
6519,1,," with this information the icc prosecutor invoked proprio motu powers to launch an investigation without a prior request from the unsc or kenya.
",
6520,1,," charges for crimes against humanity against kenyatta, ruto, sang and one other, francis muthaura, were confirmed on 8th march 2011.
",
6521,1,,"politically however the situation is difficult for the icc.
",
6522,1,," despite having been on opposite sides inin the next elections inkenyatta and ruto had put their differences behind them to form a coalition.
",
6523,1,," this coalition won theelections, though by a close margin and not without dispute, making kenyatta the fourth president of kenya and ruto his deputy.
",
6524,1,," ruto’s trial has already begun, though it was interrupted by the attack on the westgate shopping center.
",
6525,1,," kenyatta’s trial is set to take place inthough it is being delayed.
",
6526,1,," both ruto and kenyatta have stated they are willing to cooperate but have criticized the court calling it “a painfully farcical pantomime” and a “toy of declining imperial powers” while the african union has called for immunity for all sitting leaders, and for the indictment of kenyatta to be dropped.
",
6527,0,,"  uhuru kenyatta is a sitting president of a democratic nation .
",
6528,0,," this means that he was elected by the people to serve them .
",
6529,0,," by indicting a sitting leader , you undermine their ability to rule the country as they will be forced to spend long periods outside their country focusing on something that is irrelevant to the governance of their country .
",
6530,0,," the icc has demanded that kenyatta and ruto attend the trial in person .
",
6531,0,," by forcing the president and deputy president to spend long hours away from the country involved in a trial the icc is effectively disenfranchising the people who voted from him to be their leader .
",
6532,0,," further , kenyatta is first and foremost accountable to the kenyan people , who have chosen him as leader despite these claims .
",
6533,0,," it is clearly unwelcome interference by the icc for the court to take the president away from his duties .
",
6534,0,," while kenyatta and his deputy william ruto have been visiting the icc , they should have been leading their countries .
",
6535,0,," while the indictment has occurred both have remained the leaders of their countries , but have been absent while major events such as the westgate shootings occurred .
",
6536,0,," despite the need to strong leadership in the midst of a potentially divisive event , ruto was only granted one week away from trial .
",
6537,0,," having a clear and stable leadership is important for kenya to develop , restrict violence and ensure that policy development is able to continue , particularly given the cross-ethnic powering sharing arrangement between kenyatta and ruto .
",
6538,0,," absence of leadership during the fear and uncertainty surrounding this event might lead to a fresh round of violence as supporters take to the streets in protest -- this election had put former enemies kenyatta and ruto together , easing ethnic tensions in the region .
",
6539,0,," kenya has a functioning judiciary and police force .
",
6540,0,," they have successfully prosecuted some individuals for these crimes and it should be left to kenya to deliver justice for itself .
",
6541,0,," there have been several cases brought before the courts .
",
6542,0,," kenyans overwhelmingly see the icc is ` imperialist ' , and% want the icc to terminate its case against kenyatta .
",
6543,0,," if and when kenya 's leaders should be tried should be left to the domestic judiciary to decide .
",
6544,0,," while the icc feels free to interfere with african countries it would never dare to do so in a western country ; leaders such as george bush , tony blair , nicholas sarkozy and others who have launched various armed interventions have not been put on trial .
",
6545,0,," not only is it victimization and interference the trial of kenyatta is also likely to be pointless ; it is on the point of collapse .
",
6546,0,," the prosecutor fatou bensouda has stated `` having carefully considered my evidence and the impact of the two withdrawals , i have come to the conclusion that currently the case against mr. kenyatta does not satisfy the high evidentiary standards required at trial '' .
",
6547,1,,"the east african community was formed in novemberby the republics of uganda, kenya and the united republic of tanzania following the collapse of a previous community in 1977.
",
6548,1,," rwanda and burundi later joined the organisation in july 2007.
",
6549,1,," with a strong vision of a prosperous, stable, competitive, secure and politically united east africa, (1) the bloc has been hailed as the most active, vibrant and successful  in the african continent.
",
6550,1,,"(2) progress has been made in lifting immigration checks and controls to allow free movement of people among member states without travel documents, introducing the common market to boost trade in the region, unifying the education system, and most recently signing up to an east african monetary union with an aim of introducing one currency in 2024.
",
6551,1,,"  the communities successes has encouraged neighbouring countries including sudan, south sudan, ethiopia, somalia and the democratic republic of congo to show interest in joining the organisation (3) with a most recent application from south sudan in july 2011.
",
6552,1,," the east african community therefore has both options to widen by letting in new members and to deepen the community by implementing its proposed monetary union.
",
6553,0,," should the community be focused on deepening or widening?
",
6554,0,,"widening the east african community , will help enlarge the common market , increase production and improve regional trade as people will be able to freely do business across more than five countries .
",
6555,0,," prior to rwanda and burundi 's membership to the bloc in, kenya 's exports and imports to the eac were kshsbillion and kshsbillion respectively this however increased after the two countries joined creating a single market of 133.5 million people .
",
6556,0,," inkenya 's exports had risen to kshs 90.5 billion and imports to kshs 12.5 billion  .
",
6557,0,," ethiopia , drc and south sudan are all mineral rich countries and are big potential markets for east africa .
",
6558,0,," welcoming them to the community is predicted to double the production , imports and exports among member states  due to policies policies like the eac trade facilitation , customs union and competition policy and law  .
",
6559,0,," widening the east african community will help provide a strong force and voice against insecurities , conflicts and insurgencies that have torn apart much of the region .
",
6560,0,," the current eac member states have been at the fore front of maintaining peace and security in the region , with burundi , kenya and uganda sending troops to somalia and rwanda sending troops to darfur and car .
",
6561,0,," in march, the usaid assessment on east africa regional conflict and instability highlighted that the revival and expansion of the eac would favour a vision of promoting peace in the region  pointing out the lamu project aimed at creating a transport corridor linking south sudan to northern kenya and the coast .
",
6562,0,," widening the bloc will make it easy for member states to support their peacekeeping missions through the east africa community military command and also help reduce interstate invasions like sudan and south sudan or rwanda and drc as they will now be united with more closely aligned interests .
",
6563,0,," unlike other regional blocs in africa the eac has been keen to work on the improvement of education among member states .
",
6564,0,," it has policies such as the introduction of the inter university council of education to ensure the quality of university education , and an ongoing process of harmonising education curricula in all member countries  .
",
6565,0,," however , africa still remains the continent with poorest quality of education and has the lowest skilled/educated labour .
",
6566,0,," a large number of children fail to access basic education  .
",
6567,0,," enlarging and deepening the eac will therefore enhance education standards on a large part of the african continent ; such policies will lift weak academic institutions in drc , south sudan and somalia which are typical of their poor education systems .
",
6568,0,," nkwame nkurumah , one of the famous african heroes said `` africa must unite or perish '' .
",
6569,0,," this has been taken up by the african union which is calling for integration across the continent  .
",
6570,0,," widening and deepening the eac will therefore shine a light to the ideology of pan africanism .
",
6571,0,," bringing more african states together under one bloc with the same vision and institutions will help people to work together regardless of ethnic or cultural differences .
",
6572,0,," citizens will feel more east africans rather than citizens of a particular country as every citizen of the eac member state is allowed to freely travel in the region with no difficulties or discrimination as a result of the east african community 's freedom of movement  .
",
6573,0,," this will therefore encourage other blocs like the ecowas and sadc to actively perform and widen hence creating a more united africa .
",
6574,1,,"crimea will on the 16th have a referendum on whether the region should join russia.
",
6575,1,," it is almost certain that the people will ratify the decision of the crimean parliament that they want to be a region of russia not ukraine.
",
6576,1,," ukraine has maintained that such a referendum is illegal so the crimea’s vote is likely to inflame rather than dampen the tensions between russia and ukraine that have been near the point of war since russian soldiers occupied crimea as part of a crimean self-defence force.
",
6577,1,,"it is also clear that the broader international tensions will also remain.
",
6578,1,," the g7 (canada, france, germany, italy, japan, uk, and us) has said “any such referendum would have no legal effect… it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force… we would not recognize the outcome.”
",
6579,1,,"so is there any possible solution to the crisis.
",
6580,1,," it is clear that russia and the united states (acting as proxy for the ukrainian government) are a long way apart on the issue.
",
6581,1,,"  the united states wants russia to pull back its military from crimea, and also its influence including halting the referendum vote.
",
6582,1,," moreover it wants negotiations with the current ukrainian government which russia refuses to recognise.
",
6583,1,," russia rejects such terms with the foreign minister lavrov stating “to be frank it raises many questions on our side … everything was stated in terms of allegedly having a conflict between russia and ukraine, and in terms of accepting the fait accompli”.
",
6584,1,," russia says it has counter proposals that will comply with international law but has not given any clue as to what they might be.
",
6585,1,," assuming the crimea is as far as russia intends to go into ukraine then the maximalist positions by the two sides might be said to be for the russians; keep crimea, ukraine’s government replaced preferably with a pro-russian government.
",
6586,1,," while ukraine’s position would be complete russian withdrawal, and elections are held at the end of the year as planned.
",
6587,1,,"so what would be the meeting point between such positions?
",
6588,1,," russia would likely be willing to take one or the other, neither of which the west or ukraine are likely to consider a sufficient climbdown.
",
6589,1,,"the question then is how to negotiate a situation where russia gets what it wants but ukraine maintains its territorial integrity.
",
6590,1,," the lord owen, a former british foreign secretary, suggests leasing crimea to russia.
",
6591,1,," russia would negotiate a lease over not just sevastopol as they have now but over the whole of crimea.
",
6592,1,," a lease would mean that the territory remains ukrainian soil but russia has complete or almost complete control over the administration of the region.
",
6593,1,," it being a lease means that ukraine would not simply be giving up the right to administer the peninsular but would be paid for it either through cash payments or through cheap oil and gas supplies from russia.
",
6594,0,," agreeing a lease would provide a much needed peaceful solution to the crimean crisis which would not only solve the immediate crisis but would also prevent future flare ups .
",
6595,0,," shortly after russian forces moved into crimea prime minister arseny yatseniuk of ukraine said `` this is not a threat : this is actually the declaration of war to my country '' .
",
6596,0,," it has not so far been a shooting war , and no one wants it to escalate .
",
6597,0,," russia 's un ambassador has said `` russia does not want war ... we do n't want any further exacerbation of the situation . ''
",
6598,0,," but when there are constant tensions the best way to prevent a potentially unpredictable situation is to provide a solution to the situation .
",
6599,0,," a lease should be considered .
",
6600,0,," there have been many suggested motives for russia 's sending military forces into crimea .
",
6601,0,," providing a lease on crimea to russia would provide a solution to most of russia 's main objectives ; the russians in crimea are protected , and the russian hold on its black sea base is secure .
",
6602,0,," more importantly the crisis started after the defeat of president yanukovych and the resulting blow to russian prestige in what russia sees as a zero sum game , if one side wins the other automatically loses to the same extent .
",
6603,0,," an invasion or crimea regained russian leverage but left russia with little room to manoeuvre as any climb-down would leave putin with nothing .
",
6604,0,," a lease gets out of this zero sum problem as both can gain .
",
6605,0,," a lease would enable russia to make an agreement with the ukrainian government and recognise that government without having to lose face as any other solution which maintains ukrainian territorial integrity would .
",
6606,0,," ukraine is in a dire financial situation ; it has gone to the imf seeking $ 15billion to help stabilise the economy with a bailout .
",
6607,0,," the interim finance minister yuri kolobov suggests that even this amount will not be enough for the full year with ukraine needing $ 34.4 billion .
",
6608,0,," finance was one of the reasons why ukraine turned to russia in november; russia was offering money when the eu was not .
",
6609,0,," the lease agreed for the black sea fleet involves the payment of $ 90million per year and the renegotiations ininvolved giving ukraine cut price gas as well .
",
6610,0,," a lease for the whole of the peninsular with almostmillion inhabitants and is close to the size of belgium would cost a lot more , potentially enough to fill much of that financial hole .
",
6611,0,," while of the core points of sovereignty is that is indivisible this has not stopped the existence of other similar deals happening in the past .
",
6612,0,," locally the black sea fleet is a good example there have however been more famous examples in the past ; the panama canal zone was leased to the united states fromtofor $ 250,000 per year , later increased .
",
6613,0,," there are other instances of territory being leased ; the clearest example being hong kong 's new territories which were leased rent free foryears fromafter china was defeated by japan -- at the time there was a general view that if one great power gained then all the others have to as well .
",
6614,0,," that leasing territory is an established practice means that it should be easy to apply to this case .
",
6615,1,,"uganda hit the international headlines in lateand earlydue to controversy over an anti-gay law proposed by parliament and passed by the president.
",
6616,1,,"the initial bill commonly known as “kill the gays bill” was proposed by mp david bahati inand approved by parliament in decemberbefore being sent to the state house for final confirmation.
",
6617,1,," mr bahati argued that he would fight to see the bill passed claiming that it was aimed at protecting children and conserving the country’s values; “because we are a god-fearing nation, we value life in a holistic way.
",
6618,1,," it is because of those values that members of parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks”[1] he noted after the parliamentary vote to support the bill.
",
6619,1,,"despite international pressure from various countries such as the usa and uk as well as from humanitarian organisations worldwide to stop the progress of the bill uganda’s president passed it as law in february 2014.
",
6620,1,," president museveni proclaimed he did so to show that uganda is an independent country which won’t create laws just to suit other countries agendas [2].
",
6621,1,,"the anti-homosexuality act metes out jail terms of up to life for ""aggravated homosexuality"" while ""aiding and abetting homosexuality"" is punishable by seven year prison sentences.
",
6622,1,," it includes penalties for individuals, companies, media organisations, or non-governmental organisations that reach out to gay people or support lgbt rights.
",
6623,1,," individuals can be sentenced to seven years in jail.
",
6624,1,," organisations will be shut down.
",
6625,1,,"the response from around the world has mostly been critical.
",
6626,1,," the un secretary general ban ki-moon spoke against the law stressing that it violates basic human rights and endangers the lgbt community in uganda[3].
",
6627,1,," south africa’s nobel peace prize winner desmond tutu argued that there is no scientific justification for prejudice and discrimination ever, and called on museveni to strengthen uganda's culture of human rights and justice[4].
",
6628,1,," president obama in a written statement against the move noted; the new law “will be more than an affront and a danger to the gay community in uganda.
",
6629,1,," it will be a step backward for all ugandans and reflect poorly on uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people”.
",
6630,0,," it is therefore a question of concern, has the ugandan government failed its citizens on lgbt rights?
",
6631,0,,"human rights are fundamental and universal .
",
6632,0,," they do not only apply to a certain group of people and invalid to another such as homosexuals .
",
6633,0,," criminalising homosexuality in uganda considers all in the lgbt minority to be worse than second class citizens .
",
6634,0,," making them almost automatically criminal renders homosexuals sub human depriving them of their identity as ugandans .
",
6635,0,," the government has a responsibility to protect every citizen but in this case the ugandan government has taken the first step in rejecting and mistreating its own people .
",
6636,0,," the new law infringes on fundamental rights to privacy , non-discrimination , equality and freedom from cruelty and inhumane treatment  .
",
6637,0,," even before the bill was introduced the government prevented there being room for lgbt activists to explain their cause showing their lack of freedom of expression .
",
6638,0,," this and rights such as equality are universal and fundamental rights that the government of uganda has on numerous occasions signed up for in the universal declaration of human rights and the african charter on human and peoples rights among other documents .
",
6639,0,,"  articleof the ugandan constitution is clear in its separation of church and state `` uganda shall not have a state religion . ''
",
6640,0,," the government must serve all its people equally regardless religious and cultural orientation .
",
6641,0,," but this bill has been created with a religious motive .
",
6642,0,," in his interview defending the anti-gay bill , mp david bahati lamented , that god does n't accept homosexuality quoting a bible verse that the wages of sin is death  ; as if the ugandan parliament is filled with righteous souls !
",
6643,0,," the constitution allows freedom of religion and prohibits the creation of political parties based on religion  .
",
6644,0,," laws and policies should therefore not base on bible verses as not everyone will share the same belief to such scriptures .
",
6645,0,," chapterof the ugandan constitution recognises fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual as inherent and not granted by the state .
",
6646,0,," the constitution states ; all persons are equal before and under the law in all spheres of political , economic , social and cultural life and in every other respect and shall enjoy equal protection of the law ; without prejudice , a person shall not be discriminated against on the ground of sex , race , colour , ethnic origin , tribe , birth , creed or religion , or social or economic standing , political opinion or disability  .
",
6647,0,," it defines `` discriminate '' as giving different treatment to different persons attributable only or mainly to their respective descriptions by sex , race , colour , ethnic origin , tribe , birth , creed or religion , or social or economic standing , political opinion or disability .
",
6648,0,," the government has acted contrary to their own law , with president museveni remarking that what homosexuals do is disgusting , un african and had no place in his country  and mp david bahati , asserting that homosexuals do not deserve to be treated as humans .
",
6649,0,," breaching such a law while relying on such logical fallacies is a sign of how the government failed on human rights .
",
6650,1,,"on the 27th februarysoldiers seized the crimean parliament.
",
6651,1,," they did not have insignia but raised a russian flag above the building.
",
6652,1,," the crimean parliament then voted to dissolve the regional government and elected a new pro-russian leader sergey aksyonov.
",
6653,1,," he promptly requested that russia provide help to ensure “peace and calm” within the crimea.
",
6654,1,,"following the ousting in a revolution of pro-russian ukrainian president yanukovych and the loss of influence this represented russia has been happy to oblige.
",
6655,1,," russia already was engaged in a show of force with military exercises along ukraine’s borders.
",
6656,1,," it also already had troops at its black sea fleet base in crimea.
",
6657,1,," unmarked troops and helicopters, though believed to be russian, occupied sevastopol and other crimean airports taking over the transport infrastructure.
",
6658,1,," in order to prevent a response from ukraine russian troops surrounded ukrainian bases and demanded they surrender.
",
6659,1,," ukraine’s verbal response was tough with the prime minister arseny yatseniuk saying “this is not a threat: this is actually the declaration of war to my country”.
",
6660,1,," ukraine therefore clearly believes that russia had no right to send forces into crimea, a sovereign part of the country.
",
6661,1,," however ukraine has agreed with the calls for restraint, it has mobilised its army but has made no move to engage the russians and has refrained from allowing its troops to use force in crimea leading to tense but peaceful standoffs.
",
6662,1,," the endgame is integration of crimea into russia.
",
6663,1,," a referendum on the 16th march showed that 97% of voters in the crimea want to join the russian federation.
",
6664,1,," the final result is therefore that crimea is lost to the ukraine, but there being a result does not necessarily mean russia’s actions were just and moral.
",
6665,1,,"crimea itself is a peninsula out from the south of ukraine into the black sea.
",
6666,1,," crimea is strategic in large part because of the good harbours it has, something that russia otherwise lacks.
",
6667,1,," it was historically russian having been taken from the crimean khanate in 1783.
",
6668,1,," historically in russia it is notable for being the sight of heroic military action; the crimean war against french and british invasion in 1854-5, and a nine month siege of sevastopol by the wehrmacht.
",
6669,1,," a century after the crimean war inkhrushchev handed over the crimea to ukraine, the reasons are disputed, but as both were a part of the ussr it may well have simply been for convenience as there is a land bridge from ukraine but not to russia.
",
6670,1,,"history and geography are not the only causes of tensions; it is culturally and ethnically more russian than ukrainian too.
",
6671,1,," crimea has an ethnic russian majority with 60% of the population being russians.
",
6672,1,," 10-12% of the population is crimean tartars and firmly opposed to russia as a result of having been deported by stalin.
",
6673,1,," the balance is mostly ukrainian.
",
6674,1,," the language is russian and as a result most people get their news from russia.
",
6675,1,,"russia has clear interests in crimea and has basing rights for up to 25,000 troops in sevastopol which is the main base for the black sea fleet.
",
6676,1,," these forces in sevastopol both ensure that russia is particularly concerned about the security of the peninsular and that it has the means to make its views felt.
",
6677,1,," it cannot be surprising then that russia, feeling its citizens and interests threatened in the province, acted using these forces that were to hand in crimea.
",
6678,0,," president yanukovych is ukraine 's legitimate president .
",
6679,0,," he is therefore perfectly at liberty to allow russian troops into his country to keep the peace in much the same way as countries around the world welcome us troops on their soil as protection from external threats or un peacekeepers to keep the peace domestically .
",
6680,0,," yanukovych in a letter to putin called `` on the president of russia , mr. putin , asking him to use the armed forces of the russian federation to establish legitimacy , peace , law and order , stability and defending the people of ukraine . ''
",
6681,0,," the current government in ukraine is the result of an illegal coup .
",
6682,0,," on the 21st february yanukovych and the opposition in ukraine agreed to eu proposals that restored theukrainian constitution and set presidential elections for later in.
",
6683,0,," the two sides were `` to create a coalition and form a national unity government '' .
",
6684,0,," thus yanukovych was to remain president until the next elections .
",
6685,0,," the opposition however ignored this deal .
",
6686,0,," as putin puts it `` they immediately seized his residence rather than giving him a chance to fulfil the agreement ... he did n't have any chance of being reelected . ''
",
6687,0,," the ukrainian opposition used illegal and unconstitutional means to effect regime change .
",
6688,0,," russia therefore has a right to act to protect those who there has been an `` armed seizure of power '' .
",
6689,0,," russia has a strong claim to the crimea ; the territory was only handed over inby nikita krushchev for political reasons .
",
6690,0,," previously it had been russian for three hundred years .
",
6691,0,," historically crimea is russian not ukrainian .
",
6692,0,," culturally crimea is important to russia too , it was the main russian tourism destination during the soviet union and symbolised russia 's gains in the 18th and 19th centuries .
",
6693,0,," russia for most of the 1990s refused to accept ukraine 's independence , let alone crimea that crimea should be a part of it with the russian parliament engaging in actions such as declaring sevastopol a russian city .
",
6694,0,," therefore the sovereignty of the region should be considered to be contested .
",
6695,0,," it is the people of crimea who are important and their interests should be considered .
",
6696,0,," putin told the federation council that russia is responding to a `` threat to the lives of citizens of the russian federation ... and the personnel of the armed forces of the russian federation on ukrainian territory '' .
",
6697,0,," russia needs to protect both the russian citizens who are in crimea and the ethnic russians who look to moscow not kiev .
",
6698,0,," the crimean parliament has agreed to hold a referendum on 25th may on `` autonomous republic of crimea has state sovereignty and is a part of ukraine , in accordance with treaties and agreements . ''
",
6699,0,," this was put forward to 16th march with two options ; do you support crimea 's reunification with russia ?
",
6700,0,," do you support the restoration of the constitution of the crimean republic datedand crimea 's status as a part of ukraine ?
",
6701,0,," the% vote for joining russia and% turnout conclusively show that this is the will of the crimean people .
",
6702,0,," the russian parliament has agreed to approve force `` in connection with the extraordinary situation in ukraine , the threat to the lives of citizens of the russian federation , our compatriots '' the russian federal council approved the move unanimously so allowing russian troops to be used .
",
6703,0,," this gives president putting the authority to use the russian military in crimea , or elsewhere in the ukraine , if he believes it is necessary .
",
6704,0,," the crimean parliament has also asked to join russia and is to have a referendum to show the support of the people for this action .
",
6705,0,," `` from today , as crimea is part of the russian federation the only legal forces here are troops of the russian federation , and any troops of the third country will be considered to be armed groups with all the associated consequences . ''
",
6706,0,," this clearly gives russian troops the right to be in crimea .
",
6707,1,,"guinea-bissau is the fifth poorest nation state in the world.
",
6708,1,," while farming and fishing are the most prominent legal trades, the illicit drugs business is the most profitable1.
",
6709,1,," having gained independence from portugal in 1974, guinea-bissau has witnessed almost constant instability.
",
6710,1,," the civil war inwas costly to the state’s infrastructure and human development.
",
6711,1,," while there are democratic elections, no president has been able to finish their first term due to regular military coups.
",
6712,1,," the most recent coup inhad particular ramifications for the drug trade, which was able to thrive under new levels of instability2.
",
6713,1,," it’s geographical position and its national language of portuguese, which is similar to spanish, has made it an ideal location as a ‘warehouse’ for south american cartels and gangs.
",
6714,1,," due to the increased corruption and limited reach of the authorities, the nation state has been labelled as africa’s first ‘narco-state’3.
",
6715,1,,"   meanwhile, the american drug war continues in an effort to halt the illicit business globally.
",
6716,1,," the ‘war’ has its roots in thesingle convention on narcotic drugs, a conglomeration of previous treaties restricting illicit substances, which broadened the scope of illicit substances and encouraged international co-operation through the united nations.
",
6717,1,," president nixon declared a ‘war on drugs’ in 1971, believing the drug trade to be a blight on modern society.
",
6718,1,," in an effort to reduce the availability of drugs on the street, the us has looked further afield to prevent drugs from reaching western markets.
",
6719,1,," the next republican president, ronald regan, made the war on drugs a matter of national security and militarised the issue.
",
6720,1,," the us offers assistance to countries involved in the drug war, generally in the form of enforcement, eradication of crops and interdiction.
",
6721,1,," in columbia, for example, the us has provided $10 billion in military and development aid to the government in order to prevent production and eradicate the cartels and revolutionaries (farc) who use the drugs for profit4.
",
6722,1,," opinions on the “war” have become increasingly polarised in recent years, but the usa has continued this policy.
",
6723,0,," this analyses whether guinea-bissau should join the us’ war on drugs.1)      bbc, ‘guinea-bissau drug trade ‘rises since coup’,june 20122)      ibid3)      vulliamy,e. ‘how a tiny west african country became the world’s first narco state’, the guardian,march 20084)      acevedo,b. ‘ten years of plan colombia: an analytical assessment’, the beckley foundation drug policy programme, september 2008assistance from the us would ensure that the coup leaders of guinea bissau remain in power .
",
6724,0,," the securitisation of issues such as drugs and ` terror ' is encouraged by the united states .
",
6725,0,," a major problem with this policy is that it provides undue power and legitimacy to those countering the threat1 .
",
6726,0,," in early, the military were still unconstitutionally ruling over the country .
",
6727,0,," the drug war provides an external threat for the military to justify their leadership position .
",
6728,0,," considering the military has refused to allow democratic elections to occur and has regularly committed coups2 , the us drug war could be a perfect excuse for to remain in power until the ` threat ' subsides .

",
6730,0,," in order to receive assistance from the us , a state must adhere to us policy on drugs .
",
6731,0,," if it fails to do so , like bolivia did in, then aid is severed under the certification system1 .
",
6732,0,," this restricts the recipient state 's ability to respond to the drug threat in a way that they deem suitable to their own circumstances .
",
6733,0,," as a state should be free to form domestic policy without influence by external actors , the usa 's certification process is a violation of national sovereignty .

",
6737,0,," guinea-bissau 's ex naval chief na tchuto was arrested by american forces and , rather than allowing his home state to prosecute him , was tried by the new york district court .

",

",

",
6746,1,,"from its genesis, african nations have been involved in the icc structure – the first ratifying nation was senegal, and the icc has much african involvement, including five african judges and the current prosecutor, fatou bensouda.
",
6747,1,,"however, all the indictments at the icc have been for africans in cases involving african nations – almost all of which on states that voluntarily referred the cases to the court.
",
6748,1,," three african situations were not referred by a country – the sudan and libya cases were referred by the un security council, and the situation following the post-election violence in kenya in 2008-09 by the prosecutor.
",
6749,1,," the kenyan trials are ongoing, the libyan inductees are being tried in libya, and the sudanese inductees are, in the main, on the run.
",
6750,1,,"the kenya case was raised when the office of the prosecutor (otp) used its power in the rome statute, which kenya signed and ratified, to launch a case.
",
6751,1,," this followed the unwillingness of kenyan domestic authorities to prosecute those individuals deemed most responsible for orchestrating the violence after the disputedpresidential election, in which 1,000 people were killed.
",
6752,1,,"uhuru kenyatta and william ruto, two prominent kenyan politicians, were indicted, appeared voluntarily, and had their charges confirmed in 2012.
",
6753,1,," kenyatta is accused of using a banned gang to keep power for one party at all costs, while ruto is accused of ethnically cleansing ethnic groups seen as supportive of another candidate from certain areas.
",
6754,1,," however, following their election as president and deputy president of kenya respectively earlier in 2013, the african union moved towards taking a position hostile to the icc.
",
6755,1,," the ruto and kenyatta trials are the unique - the first leaders selected by generally free and fair elections to be tried by the icc.
",
6756,1,,"this case has brought to a head the question of the membership of african states in the icc.
",
6757,1,," kenya’s parliament has voted in favour of withdrawing from the icc.
",
6758,1,," kenya however has not yet actually decided to declare its intention to withdraw to the un which would be necessary to withdraw.
",
6759,1,," once a state has stated its intention to withdraw it takes a year to take effect.
",
6760,1,," if kenya were to leave it would be the first state party to do so.
",
6761,0,," every person indicted by the icc so far has been an african , for events which occurred in africa , all bar one case , the libya situation , in which no trials have started and seem a long way off , are in sub-saharan africa .
",
6762,0,," the icc has not brought actions against anyone involved in conflict in colombia , or for the conflict in sri lanka or for human rights abuses around the world .
",
6763,0,," the icc is simply selectively prosecuting .
",
6764,0,," instead of the icc structure , the african union has proposed an african criminal court .
",
6765,0,," an acc could not only bring justice home to africa , by creating a court which will not appear to african nations as being imposed by outsiders , but also be able to have additional remits to address other issues in africa that the icc does not have powers to deal with , such as coups , corruption and drug trafficking .
",
6766,0,," an african criminal court may also have a chance of being seen as more legitimate than the icc , which had only% support in kenya in july.
",
6767,0,," the icc creates a way that foreigners , and in particular the west with its tendency towards intervention , can remove and imprison african leaders .
",
6768,0,," uhuru kenyatta , the president of kenya , who has been indicted by the court , has referred to it as a `` toy of declining imperialist powers '' .
",
6769,0,," the court is largely funded by western countries , with the european union providing over half the cost .
",
6770,0,," so it should not be surprising if the west has a lot of power over the court .
",
6771,0,," moreover the west is dominant in the united nations security council so potentially controls both the methods of referring a country to the icc without its permission .
",
6772,0,," the icc has not been particularly effective in dealing with the situation in uganda , the icc prosecutions having been a distraction to local community reconciliation and leading to further violence .
",
6773,0,," similarly , the situation in darfur has not been helped by icc involvement , with mass destruction of villages by people already indicted by the international criminal court .
",
6774,0,," due to his indictment , a diplomatic solution has become harder as rome statute signatories are under a legal duty to arrest sudanese leader omar al-bashir , although many have just ignored this .
",
6775,1,," russia has long seen the post-soviet space, the countries of the former ussr, as its special sphere of interest.
",
6776,1,," it has been willing to engage in military adventures within the region.
",
6777,1,," in response to the latest such adventure, in crimea launched at the end of february 2014, us secretary of state john kerry threatened “he [russia’s president putin] is not going to have a sochi g8, he may not even remain in the g8 if this continues.”
",
6778,1,," the west wants to react to russia’s military action but has few good choices about what can be done.
",
6779,1,," a military response is impossible due to russia’s military power.
",
6780,1,," economic sanctions bring the threat of gas cut-offs to europe – russian gas accounts for almost 9% of germany’s energy use.
",
6781,1,," this leaves the slow process of international institutions; the g8 is one such institution.
",
6782,1,,"the response to the takeover, or invasion, of crimea has been comparatively mild.
",
6783,1,," after the crimean parliament declared the province to be a part of russia the eu responded with minor sanction “to suspend bilateral talks with the russian federation on visa matters as well as talks with the russian federation on the new agreement.”
",
6784,1,," the european union however held out the possible of further action if the situation is not returned to the status quo ante – what it was before the start of the crisis.
",
6785,1,,"at its foundation inthe g6 of the main western economies of france, west germany, italy, japan, uk, and us was to provide a place for leaders to discuss economic concerns.
",
6786,1,," canada joined the next year to create the g7 at which size it remained for twenty two years until russia joined in 1998.
",
6787,1,," as the organisation involves summits and unlike many international organisations has no secretariat it has no specific membership criteria though with the general demand for members to be democracies and highly industrialised; new members are invited by the remaining members, and similarly can be thrown out the same way.
",
6788,1,," the institution has already been chosen as one avenue of showing the west’s displeasure at russian actions without escalating the situation as the preparatory meeting for the june g8 summit in sochi has been cancelled.
",
6789,1,," since russia is engaging in actions contrary to the interests of the other seven members should they no longer consider it to be a member?
",
6790,0,," the intention of international institutions is to bind countries together , to ensure they speak to each other and resolve differences , and to ensure they feel they can not engage in aggressive actions .
",
6791,0,," however when a state breaks these norms there needs to be a reaction .
",
6792,0,," russia has been willing to engage in aggressive acts time and time again .
",
6793,0,," the recent occupation of crimea is very similar to russia 's war with georgia in; in both conflicts russia used the excuse of russians being in danger , in both cases russia was there as a ` peacekeeper ' , and in both cases the action was in another sovereign country whose government did not wish russian troops there .
",
6794,0,," the result is an expansion of russian influence and some form of annexation .
",
6795,0,," there was no action after the russian conflict with georgia except a mediated peace .
",
6796,0,," there now needs to be a response to actions in crimea ; throwing russia out of the g8 is the least response .
",
6797,0,," the focus of the g8 is on economic , monetary , financial and globilisation issues .
",
6798,0,," aggressive actions scare the markets -- as shown by the rouble reaching new lows against the dollar and euro -- so run counter to the focus of the g8 .
",
6799,0,," russia has in the past also used its gas supplies as an economic weapon , this and acts of aggression such as in crimea are repudiating the idea of globilisation .
",
6800,0,," the g8 is important because there is `` a good understanding among g8 members '' clearly when one of those members is engaging in conflictual acts that understanding is damaged .
",
6801,0,," the g7 members on 2nd marchin a statement responding to russia 's aggression in the crimea stated `` russia 's actions in ukraine also contravene the principles and values on which the g-7 and the g-8 operate '' .
",
6802,0,," any member that does not follow the principles of an organisation should be suspended as a member .
",
6803,0,," the g8 has been meant to be a group of industrialised democracies .
",
6804,0,," russia is neither particularly industrialised , nor particularly democratic .
",
6805,0,," russia remains reliant on natural resources for much of its wealth ;% of its gdp and% of exports .
",
6806,0,," its most recent presidential election -- that voted in putin for a third term -- was not exactly free and fair .
",
6807,0,," the osce election observers concluded `` there was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt '' .
",
6808,0,," its qualifications for membership have been questioned from the very beginning , when russia joined the g7 were able to argue inclusion would bring it closer to the west .
",
6809,0,," yet russia remains essentially an outsider in the group , it does not share western values and goes its own way .
",
6810,0,," european states , which make up half of the members of the g8 , have been reluctant to take stronger economic steps against aggressive russian actions .
",
6811,0,," russia has warned the us `` we will encourage everybody to dump us treasury bonds , get rid of dollars as an unreliable currency and leave the us market . ''
",
6812,0,," the european countries have more reason to be concerned because they rely on russia for their gas supplies ;% of german gas and% of total energy consumption is reliant on russia .
",
6813,0,," if russia were to retaliate to sanctions it could seriously damage the european economy .
",
6814,0,," this means that throwing russia out of the g8 or other institutions is the biggest sanction that does not have any risk of economic retaliation and escalation that damage everyone .
",
6815,1,,"the figure of lenin as the father of modern russia and that of stalin as the strong leader par excellence have remained an important part of the russian identity and its vision of leadership.
",
6816,1,," a nation that spreads over a territory ofmillion square miles with a diverse historical background and with a population of even more diverse cultural backgrounds, russia is by no means an easy state to manage.
",
6817,1,," the ability to lead is thus maintained in high regard by the people of russia and perhaps the only recent leader to match lenin’s revolutionary spirit and stalin’s strong personality and stern decision-making style has been vladimir putin.
",
6818,1,,"since the famous bolshevik revolution inand the emergence and rule of the communist party that followed, russia has experienced both the highs of economic progress and revolutionizing politics as well as the lows of political purges, great patriotic war (wwii), the cold war and economic collapse.
",
6819,1,," with the introduction of the famous gorbachev reforms of perestroika and glasnost in the 1980s, russia began to open up to the capitalist system and to the idea of liberal democracy.
",
6820,1,," following gorbachev’s reforms, boris yeltsin continued to lead russia towards slow democratic reform untilwhen vladimir putin was elected president.
",
6821,1,," a former kgb officer who had kept a fairly low profile in post-communist russian politics, putin emerged as a quiet yet powerful leader who was not afraid to make bold statements and take swift actions.
",
6822,1,," riding on a platform of fighting corruption, secession and terrorist threats, putin won the hearts and minds of disillusioned russians.
",
6823,1,," however, his political actions and powerful character risk turning him into more of an authoritarian leader than the elected leader of a democratic country.
",
6824,1,," inputin completed his second term in office, swapping roles with his former prime minister dmitry medvedev.
",
6825,0,," although nominally inferior to president medvedev, putin is widely considered to still be the real power in russia and may well run for president again in 2012.
",
6826,0,,"since the fall of communism , russia has plunged into a deep economic recession .
",
6827,0,," the introduction of market reforms and privatization has led to a swift increase in inequalities coupled with an increase in corruption .
",
6828,0,," the chaos of economic and political reform , along with the chaos of the break-up of former ussr , has left the majority of the population both disillusioned and distrustful of their government .
",
6829,0,," in a period of such chaos , stability seems to be much more important than reform .
",
6830,0,," a strong leader is the only solution to providing such stability , setting a clear direction and pulling a country at risk of falling apart together again .
",
6831,0,," this is also proven from various polls among the russian population -- `` ... the most eye-catching statistic is the overwhelming majority of respondents who say that order is more important for russia than democracy --per cent , withper cent responding conversely . ''
",
6832,0,,"  putin is the strong leader that russia has been waiting for .
",
6833,0,," his electoral success and consistently high approval rates show that the people of russia are ready for someone who can rid their society of increasing corruption and restore a sense of calm and equality .
",
6834,0,," his ability to maintain a high level of support despite what some have called authoritarian tendencies shows that people are ready to sacrifice a certain degree of freedom for the promise of stability .
",
6835,0,," enthusiasm for putin among the young also shows that he does not only appeal to those looking back to past certainties .
",
6836,0,," putin 's authoritarian style is not a threat to democracy but rather a requirement for a successful and quicker transition .
",
6837,0,," having putin control the media is probably healthier than having it be controlled by a corrupt few that promote their personal interests rather than the interest of the state and thus those of the population at large .
",
6838,0,," democracy is a goal and while certain countries believe themselves to have achieved it , they are constantly struggling to maintain it .
",
6839,0,," as a young democracy , russia is still working towards defining its own version of democracy and finding what works best in its case .
",
6840,0,," historically , russia has always needed strong centralised leadership for it to make progress .
",
6841,0,," this was true both in imperial times under tsars such as peter the great , who made russia a european power and built st petersburg , and alexander ii , who freed the serfs , and sinceunder lenin and stalin .
",
6842,0,," russia is too big , too diverse and too thinly-populated for western systems of representative democracy to be applied .
",
6843,0,," culturally its people are temperamentally suited to following the decisive lead of a strong ruler who can unite them in the face of great challenges .
",
6844,0,," without such a ruler russia is likely to fragment with local strongmen grabbing power in the regions , religious fundamentalism dominating much of the caucasus and central asia , and economic stagnation .
",
6845,1,,"rapid, unplanned, urbanisation across africa has been synthesised with the prevalence of slums.
",
6846,1,," slums are officially defined as a household lacking either durable housing, sufficient living space, access to safe water and sanitation, and security of tenure (un-habitat, 2007).
",
6847,1,," however, across africa the definition and recognition of slums remains political.
",
6848,1,," slums are recognised as unhealthy landscapes and geographies of neglect.
",
6849,1,," previous attempted solutions to slums have included slum upgrading schemes offering in-situ service provision and improvements, mass evictions, and recognising slum dwellers as secure owners including granting the right to build.
",
6850,1,," in sub-saharan africa’s attempt to meet the 7th millennium development goal - improving the lives of at leastmillion slum dwellers - relative reductions have been made in the percentage of urban slum dwellers.
",
6851,1,," however, the share of urban slum dwellers in ssa is still higher than any other world region, at 62%, with the slum-dwellers experiencing a greater depth of deprivation (un, 2012, p.50).
",
6852,1,,"however, is the solution a matter of fixing supply or demand?
",
6853,1,," this turns to two factors.
",
6854,1,," firstly, exploring what the slum dwellers needs are, and what solutions can enable just and inclusive cities to be maintained.
",
6855,1,," considering the diverse strategies of investments made into the housing sector what changes are felt; are needs met?
",
6856,1,," secondly, the role of urban governance - identified as a key factor in both the prevalence of slums and their subsequent future (un-habitat, 2007; etc).
",
6857,1,," it needs to be understood how urban actors influence housing markets and the sustainability of outcomes.
",
6858,1,," in a marxist ideology, housing is the source of reproduction, sustaining the economy, and fundamentally needs to be provided by the state; however, are housing schemes introduced improving the lives of slum dwellers or are they being built as a result of other motives?
",
6859,1,," as housing inequalities grow what intervention is needed?
",
6860,1,," there remains a danger of assuming investing in housing will be the means to end all slums.
",
6861,0,," we live in a planet of slums , davis  , and slums remain a key , and growing , characteristic of contemporary african cities .
",
6862,0,," slums articulate the infrastructural deficit across african cities - investments are needed .
",
6863,0,," slums are a key urban challenge ; and need to be tackled , removed , and replaced .
",
6864,0,," `` slums represent the worst of urban poverty and inequality '' , annan ,: v .
",
6865,0,," slums represent an increasing concern .
",
6866,0,," they are often in unstable environments so are at high risk of being affected by climate change which will further increase costs unless effective strategies are implemented today .
",
6867,0,," providing safe and secure housing provides a means to tackle articulated problems .
",
6868,0,," planning will organise the structure of housing communities , follow laws to provide adequate toilets for the population , and enable space for service provision - whether hospitals , police , or schools .
",
6869,0,," investing in housing will help alleviate chaos ; and implement ordered planning for ` cities without slums ' .
",
6870,0,," slum upgrading involves in-situ investment to improve informal settlements ; and integrate slums into the city .
",
6871,0,," two forms of slum upgrading may be classified : the provision of basic services , i.e. housing and sanitation , and the provision of secure land tenure .
",
6872,0,," the burden of disease is higher in slums due to inadequate sanitation , overcrowding , and a lack of ventilation .
",
6873,0,," diseases and infections - including diarrhoea , cholera , malaria , tb , and tropical diseases , remain prevalent throughout due to stagnant water and a lack of services .
",
6874,0,," research indicates higher rates of child and elderly mortality in nairobi 's slums , in comparison to the rest of the population , kyobutungi et al  .
",
6875,0,," improving housing does not just mean building but also ensuring planning standards are followed to create sufficient living space and facilities to reduce the ill-health disadvantage .
",
6876,0,," slum dwellers , particularly women , are affected by violence and crime .
",
6877,0,," cohre  indicates women living in slums are at risk of violence and illnesses , such as hiv/aids , due to insecurities experienced on a daily basis in personal and private spaces .
",
6878,0,," figures show that in nairobi slumslatrine is shared amongstpeople , cities alliance  .
",
6879,0,," fearing to go to the toilet at night due to risk of rape , women 's geographical experience of the city is constrained .
",
6880,0,," therefore investing in houses , including building indoor toilets , provides empowerment , safety , and prevents gender based violence .
",
6881,0,," reports are frequently raised on fire outbreaks and hazards in slums .
",
6882,0,," for example , a fire in khayelitsha township , cape town , resulted in five deaths and significant damage .
",
6883,0,," the use of highly flammable materials , in a desire for fast construction , places slum-dwellers prone to risk .
",
6884,0,," national investment in housing , by providing materials , such as bricks , or training on how to build stable house designs , will ensure safety .
",
6885,0,," haphazard building can be controlled by investing in housing designs and inspections .
",
6886,0,," a key issue ensuring the growth of slums is the demand for housing is failing to be met .
",
6887,0,," investment is required to supply housing .
",
6888,0,," taking the case of social housing programs provided by pahf , pan-african housing fund , demand is being met by providing affordable houses .
",
6889,0,," 41.5 mn us$ has been confirmed by pahf , of which will be dedicated to fulfil the need for houses .
",
6890,0,," investments are focusing on urban areas across sub-saharan africa , and are operating through partnerships .
",
6891,0,," if slums are ever to be halted there need to be many more such projects ensuring the supply of houses outstrips demand .
",
6892,0,," affordability is a key challenge for slum-dwellers to enter the housing sector - challenges range from being able to access capital required to buy property , to the volatile prices in africa 's property market .
",
6893,0,," improving housing in slums enables dwellers a choice to exit and move up the property ladder .
",
6894,0,," different approaches have emerged of how provide a means to access finance and generate property markets .
",
6895,0,," first , housing micro-finance schemes are presenting a flexible means to access credit .
",
6896,0,," second , cooperative loans , such as nigeria 's fmbn , federal mortgage bank of nigeria , are acting to increase homeownership by providing a secondary mortgage market for low-income families and make finance available .
",
6897,0,," the aim is to ensure repayments are equal to rent costs paid .
",
6898,1,,"migration has remained a key concern in africa over time; with research focused on identifying the patterns of migration, scope of migration, and fundamentally understand why people move.
",
6899,1,," with 'mobility' identified as a key characteristics of our contemporary age, various trends can be found across africa.
",
6900,1,," with records showing rising rates in international immigration; and increased inter-continental movement, new theories have emerged to provide reasoning for such realities.
",
6901,1,," whether as a result of choice or constraint, such as a natural disaster, a livelihood strategy or individual decision to seek employment, the contemporary reality of migration shows movement needs to be prioritised, discussed, and debated.
",
6902,1,," with the stabilisation of an african union, or pan-african agenda, concern over climate change, and complexities of urbanisation, new policies and understandings are required for migration, and migrants.
",
6903,1,,"therefore in taking a synthesised perspective this debate asks what government policies are needed.
",
6904,1,," two key relationships are introduced: the relation between migration and development; and that of migration and rights.
",
6905,1,," a free labour market is defined as a market sphere which enables liberty, and freedom, between buyers and sellers, to exchange, trade, and mobilise.
",
6906,1,," in this case, the labour market is referred to in three contexts: internal (synthesising rural and urban markets), crossborders, and regional.
",
6907,1,," the question remains, by encouraging a laissez-faire approach to the movement of people, goods, and services, can a solution be found to underlying issues across africa?
",
6908,1,,"in debating the relevance of a free labour market, and migration, across africa this debate centres on why it remains important in contemporary africa; and to what extent the policy will have desirable practical effects.
",
6909,0,," can the rights of migrants be met; and what opportunities does migration raise?
",
6910,0,,"a free labour market provides a space for sharing , knowledge , ideas , and socio-cultural traditions , competing , and sustaining efficiency in development .
",
6911,0,," as neoliberal theory advocates a laissez-faire approach is fundamental for growth .
",
6912,0,," a free labour market will enhance economic productivity .
",
6913,0,," free labour movement enables access to new employment opportunities and markets .
",
6914,0,," within the east african community the common market protocol , cmp ,  has removed barriers towards the movement of people , services , capital , and goods .
",
6915,0,," free regional movement is granted to citizens of any member state in order to aid economic growth .
",
6916,0,," free movement is providing solutions to regional poverty by expanding the employment opportunities available , enabling faster and efficient movement for labour , and reducing the risk of migration for labour .
",
6917,0,," similar to initial justifications of europe 's labour market , a central idea is to promote labour productivity within the region .
",
6918,0,," recent reports by the hdr  and wdr  have shown migration is a means of development -- free movement has the power to alleviate poverty , enable markets , and connectivity .
",
6919,0,," taking recent evidence concerning worldwide remittance flows , the developmental nature of free movement is shown .
",
6920,0,," in, it is estimated , through international migration , $ 414bn were remitted back to developing countries .
",
6921,0,," remittance flows into africa , from within and internationally , accounted for $ 40bn in, accounting for an increasing percentage of gdp , afdb ,; ifad  .
",
6922,0,," northern africa articulated the largest total of remittances received .
",
6923,0,," remittances remain beneficial for supporting livelihoods .
",
6924,0,," the influx of remittances to households provides security , an additional income for support , enables household consumption , and investment in alternative assets , such as education and land , of which present crucial benefits in reducing poverty .
",
6925,0,," although the geography of remittances remains uneven , and currently barriers remain to sending and receiving money , the developmental potential of remittances from african diasporas , both outside and within africa , is now recognised .
",
6926,0,," national borders are a result of africa 's colonial history .
",
6927,0,," the boundaries constructed do not reflect meaning or unite ethnic groups across the continent .
",
6928,0,," the border between togo and ghana alone divides the dagomba , akposso , konkomba and ewe peoples .
",
6929,0,," therefore encouraging freedom of movement across africa will erase a vital component of africa 's colonial history .
",
6930,0,," the erasing of boundaries , for labour markets , will have significant impacts for rebuilding a sense of unity , and reducing xenophobic fears , of which have been politically constructed .
",
6931,0,," a sense of unity will motivate citizens to reduce disparities and inequalities of poverty .
",
6932,0,," even without the implementation of a free labour market , migration will continue informally ; therefore policies introducing free movement and providing appropriate travel documents provides a method to manage migration .
",
6933,0,," in the case of southern africa , the lack of a regional framework enabling migration is articulated through the informal nature of movement and strategic bilateral ties between nation-states .
",
6934,0,," several benefits arise from managing migration .
",
6935,0,," first , speeding up the emigration process will provide health benefits .
",
6936,0,," evidence shows slow , and inefficient , border controls have led to a rise in hiv/aids ; as truck drivers wait in delays sex is offered .
",
6937,0,," second , a free labour market can provide national governments with data and information .
",
6938,0,," the provision of travel documentation provides migrants with an identity , and as movement is monitored , the big picture of migration can be provided .
",
6939,0,," information , evidence , and data , will enable effective policies to be constructed for places of origin and destination , and to enable trade efficiency .
",
6940,0,," lastly , today , undocumented migrants are unable to claim their right to health care .
",
6941,0,," in africa , availability does not equate to accessibility for new migrants .
",
6942,0,," in south africa , migrants fear deportation and harassment , meaning formal health treatment and advice is not sought , human rights watch  .
",
6943,0,," therefore documentation and formal approval of movement ensures health is recognised as an equal right .
",
6944,0,," mobility is a human right - which needs to be enabled across national spaces and africa .
",
6945,0,," obstacles need to be removed .
",
6946,0,," mobility enables access to interconnected rights - such as ensuring women their right to move enables empowerment in the political , social and economic spheres .
",
6947,0,," taking the case of migration of young people , the process reflects a right of passage , a means of exploring opportunities and identity.
",
6948,0,,"for example the mourides of senegal have established a dense network sustaining informal trading across multiple scales based on a foundation of ` brotherhood ' youths leaving rural areas become integrated into dynamic social networks and educated within the mouride culture .
",
6949,0,," as research in tanzania shows although migration is not a priority for all youths , many identify the opportunity as a time to prove yourself and establish your transition into adulthood .
",
6950,0,," the process empowers human identity and rights .
",
6951,1,,"what would africa look like if women rose to positions of power in politics?
",
6952,1,," how would ‘african governance’ change if women were included within governing bodies?
",
6953,1,," should quotas for including women be drawn up, and legally set, for all african nations?
",
6954,1,,"when discussing women in africa we are reminded of the gender inequalities prevalent within all societies.
",
6955,1,," in order to counter-act this increasingly countries worldwide have set quotas on including women in politics.
",
6956,1,," africa has been at the forefront of this trend.
",
6957,1,," senegal established its women in politics quota in 2010.
",
6958,1,," the quota acts to ensure at least half of local and national candidates are women.
",
6959,1,," national women’s movements played a key factor in prompting the new gender quota, and legal enshrinement of including women in politics.
",
6960,1,," through the quota system women’s political presence is rising.
",
6961,1,," it is reportedout of thehouses of parliament where women represent 30% of the political body are based in africa (the economist, 2013).
",
6962,1,," despite such positive figures when considering what countries showcase the highest gender inequalities, african nations representout of the worst(global gender gap report, 2011).
",
6963,1,," the worst ranked included chad, ivory coast, and nigeria.
",
6964,1,,"it therefore seems relevant to ask whether the countries in africa that are lagging behind should follow the lead of the most progressive.
",
6965,1,," what difference does it make to include quotas on women, and should quotas be encouraged across african nation-states?
",
6966,1,," this returns to the role of women in politics in africa – what it means, brings, and presents an opportunity to change.
",
6967,0,," the focus questions whether countries, such as senegal, are pioneering an innovative system that can change the lives of women and nations?
",
6968,0,,"quotas are building representative democracies .
",
6969,0,," through the quota system women are given a voice in society .
",
6970,0,," quotas mean women are represented in politics .
",
6971,0,," women are half of the electorate so should be around half of the legislature .
",
6972,0,," although not there yet the rising numbers symbolise positive change .
",
6973,0,," in, on average , 1/5 of mps in sub-saharan africa were women , the economist  .
",
6974,0,," in south africa and rwanda the number is far above this .
",
6975,0,," women make up% of parliament seats in south africa , and% in rwanda , ibid .
",
6976,0,," .
",
6977,0,," at present , in africa we havefemale presidents , liberia ; malawi , ; andprime minister , aminata toure , senegal .
",
6978,0,," notably malawi , rwanda , senegal , and south africa all have some form of quota system , quotaproject  .
",
6979,0,," including women in politics helps enable poverty to be tackled .
",
6980,0,," poverty is a women 's issue ; women are more likely to live in poverty than men , and women are needed in politics to change this .
",
6981,0,," women understand each other , and what they need .
",
6982,0,," furthermore , although data varies , evidence shows gender inequalities remain intertwined to poverty and impoverishment .
",
6983,0,," women in positions of power and leadership can put the issues women face on the agenda and apply action .
",
6984,0,," there is clearly a need to get women into politics to counter the current ` boys club ' that exists in most countries where men help each other into positions of power squeezing out women and other methods of doing things .
",
6985,0,," african politics remains masculinised and strongly male dominated .
",
6986,0,," implementing quotas shows a commitment to change gender inequalities by increasing women 's political participation , bachelet  .
",
6987,0,," more women mean gender imbalances can be changed , women empowered , and the territorial boundaries defining what men and women do will become blurred .
",
6988,0,," additionally women in african politics can change the ` boys club ' of bad governance in africa .
",
6989,0,," bad governance can be tackled as the prominence of males controlling decisions will be changed , and internal political relations altered .
",
6990,0,," the least corrupt countries on the continent ; rwanda and botswana both have some form of quota system , quotaproject  transparency international  international relations debates , and conflict theories , suggest more women in politics makes for a safer world .
",
6991,0,," in pinker 's  book the feminisation of politics is identified as a key factor to explain the decline in conflict and violence -- battle deaths have declined fromper 100,000 people to onlyortoday .
",
6992,0,," women are more inclined to call for peace resolution and being ` maternal beings ' reflect nurturing behaviours .
",
6993,1,,"tunisia is well known for its numerous tourist attractions and its holiday destinations on its coastline.
",
6994,1,," in 2010, the tourism industry brought in a revenue of £1.18 billion (3.2 billion dinar)1.
",
6995,1,," the industry employed 450,000 people directly andmillion indirectly2.
",
6996,1,,"  the beach holiday resorts are popular with europeans due to the high temperatures, high quality of hotels and, unlike many other muslim countries, the availability of alcohol.
",
6997,1,," the remains of the ancient city of carthage, excavated in the mid nineteenth century, have attracted those interested in history and classical studies.
",
6998,1,,"  the saharan desert has also proved to be a popular tourist destination; the set of the fictional planet of tatooine from the star wars films is a famous attraction.
",
6999,1,,"the leisure industry suffered inwhen the jasmine revolution swept president for life ben ali from power.
",
7000,1,," tourism decreased from £1.18 billion to £814 million (2.2 billion dinar) indue to the perceived instability in the new transitional environment2.
",
7001,1,," while there has been an increase in revenue since the revolution, the event has prompted a discussion on whether tunisia should rely on their tourism anymore.
",
7002,1,," post revolution tunisia has been focussed on using this sector for economic recovery.
",
7003,1,," tunisian minister jamal gamra has been quoted as saying that ‘the importance of tourism-and investment in tourism- to the economy cannot be understated’3.
",
7004,1,," this is focussed on whether relying upon tourism for future economic growth is viable or not.
",

",
7007,0,," the violence and break down in law and order following the tunisian revolution resulted in a notable decrease in tourists as tourists were unwilling to visit an area which they view as dangerous .
",
7008,0,," this is demonstrated by the footfall of tourists which declined from 6,487,000 into 4,456,000 in1 .
",
7009,0,," the increase in attacks by salafists , a conservative sect of islam which promotes sharia law and has attacked tourist destinations , has dissuaded many potential visitors2 .
",
7010,0,," this has been exacerbated by government travel information which generally advises against visiting regions during periods of unrest , especially for westerners who are perceived as profitable targets for ransom3 .
",
7011,0,," the resultant decrease in tourists reduces revenue , making tourism an unreliable industry for tunisia .
",

",
7014,0,," the industry 's main targets are european , middle class income visitors on package holidays to sea-side resorts .
",
7015,0,," this has resulted in a low per-capita spending rate as food , drink and travel are all usually included in sea-side holiday resorts .
",
7016,0,," average per-capita spending for tourists in tunisia amounted to around $inwhich is low when compared to egypt 's $and greece 's $.
",
7017,0,," this reliance on a low-profit niche in the tourism industry is a systematic flaw which will not provide the economic growth which the country needs .

",
7019,0,," international tourism is a very competitive market , relying on the industry is therefore an illogical policy .
",
7020,0,," tunisia is already being undercut on prices by other countries despite its low fees .
",
7021,0,," morocco , spain and turkey can afford to charge a lower price for package tours than tunisia due to better air transportation links1 .
",
7022,0,," even before the jasmine revolution , tunisia was starting to lose ground to these countries .
",
7023,0,," the ten years before the removal of ben ali saw the number of tourists to tunisia rise from five to seven million , whilst morocco rose from five to nine million2 .
",
7024,0,," outside of the mediterranean , tunisia must compete with popular tourist destinations such as the far east , north america and australasia .

",
7027,0,," without sustainability , economic growth will only last in the short term .
",
7028,0,," this is especially pertinent for tourism , where environmental beauty is of particular importance .
",
7029,0,," from the construction of infrastructure and travel , to the general waste produced , tourism is problematic in the sense that it can often cause pollution ; which in turn damages the country 's reputation1 .
",
7030,0,," most tourists to the region are from europe , although there are an increasing number of russians which means travel becomes a major source of pollution .
",
7031,0,," a return journey via plane from london to tunis creates aroundkg of co2 , standard passenger jets create around 0.17 kg of co2 per km ,.
",
7032,0,," this is disproportionately damaging compared to other vehicles , but is the most practical way of reaching tunisia .

",
7035,1,,"tax is vital for a state; it is needed in order to carry out any of the functions of a state from national defence to welfare.
",
7036,1,," however there is often a perception that africa largely survives on handouts with a less developed taxation system.
",
7037,1,," investigating future trajectories for african development has therefore begun to focus on how domestic resources can be mobilised - how can tax be collected and what is a sustainable taxation policy?
",
7038,1,," tanzania presents one innovative idea; taxing mobile phones.
",
7039,1,," in junetanzania’s tra (tax revenue authority) confirmed the implementation of a national sim card tax.
",
7040,1,," the tax policy will impose a 1,000 tanzanian shilling tax on each subscribed sim card.
",
7041,1,," with the prevalence of tanzania’s informal economy argued to represent a barrier, and the prevalence of mobile technology identified as a potential taxable asset, to what extent does the sim card taxation provide a pioneering model to be followed by others?
",
7042,1,,"                                                    taxation in tanzania has remained a source of conflict and tension over time.
",
7043,1,," following independence, mwalimu julius nyerere focused on building a unified, national ideology.
",
7044,1,," one method for building unity was taxation incentives centred on the concept of ujamaa - such as the ‘poll tax’.
",
7045,1,," however, the implementation of tax policies has proved to be prone to violence, repressive, and created conflictual state-society relations.
",
7046,1,," therefore considering the contentious history of taxation does the revised approach offer solutions?
",
7047,1,," the model advocates a universal tax, for all, on a product which has become more accessible and a vital, modern day necessity.
",
7048,1,," similarities may be drawn to the socialist ideologies motivating nyerere’s ujamaa.
",
7049,1,," the model is universalising an equal, tax payment.
",
7050,1,," the model is currently gaining regional support, with uganda and kenya implementing similar taxation models.
",
7051,1,,"upon returning to the ideas, interests, and context, of the tax policy this debate explores the controversy surrounding the model.
",
7052,1,," the financial reform is putting taxation on the policy agenda, however, is it targeting the right resources for poverty reduction, promoting good governance, and sustaining high growth rates?
",
7053,1,," decisions have recently been confirmed to reject the sim card tax.
",
7054,0,," in order to sustain development and growth nations need to build domestic resource mobilisation capacities - through collecting tax and savings .
",
7055,0,," domestic resource mobilisation enables the transition into a capitalist mode of production - poverty can be targeted and sufficient economies built .
",
7056,0,," social and economic facilities can be provided .
",
7057,0,," to meet the millennium development goals , mdgs , and enhance performance capacity african nation-states need to improve the amount of funding they raise through taxes .
",
7058,0,," in order for development to be assisted , international donors and intervention needs to focus on encouraging innovative models of taxation such as taxing mobile phones .
",
7059,0,," such taxes do n't have the track record of failure other taxes have providing a new opportunity to redesign the taxation system .
",
7060,0,," initiatives such as the mobile phone tax provide a trial for such a new model helping to gain support for future changes .
",
7061,0,," between 2003-2009 the annual growth rate of mobile cellular subscriptions in tanzania was 44.21 % , higher than the average in africa , ondiege  .
",
7062,0,," estimations suggest around 18bn tsh will be collected a month through the sim card tax model , rweyemamu  .
",
7063,0,," in, tanzania 's total gdp was calculated at ~ 45tr tsh - the tax could therefore provide almost 0.5 % of gdp in taxes .
",
7064,0,," such a boost in government taxation will enable projects such as improving rural infrastructure , including potentially mobile phone coverage !
",
7065,0,," , or help reduce the deficit .
",
7066,0,," that one tax can raise so much shows the potential of this kind of taxation .
",
7067,0,," the model is for rolling out a tax for all , on a commodity used by all .
",
7068,0,," the cost is small and fair , only applying to individuals who are able to afford to buy and use a working mobile phone .
",
7069,0,," those who can afford multiple phones will be hit harder so this is a progressive tax .
",
7070,0,," arguments suggesting the tax cost is unreasonable fails to look at the politics constructing such a discourse and manipulating what collected tax can do .
",
7071,0,," motivations for opposition are not necessarily emerging out of concern for individuals ' well-being , but rather have alternative motives .
",
7072,0,," the moat , mobile operators association of tanzania , oppose the tax fearing profit margins may decline ; and politicians may use fear over the new tax policy to gain political support for oppositional parties .
",
7073,0,," the opposition of the operators however merely reaffirms that it is a fair tax and those who would support opposition to the measure can be won round through explaining this .
",
7074,1,,"africa has abundant natural resources.
",
7075,1,," from diamond and timber to oil, the continent has a large concentration of mineral wealth which has turned africa in to a major exporter of these goods.
",
7076,1,," there arecountries in africa which are termed as resource rich, where oils and minerals count for over 20% of gdp.
",
7077,1,," these resources were a primary reason for the involvement of western powers on the continent, which soon resulted in the scramble for africa.
",
7078,1,,"since decolonisation the west has continued its extraction of africa’s resources, with other countries such as china involving themselves more recently.
",
7079,1,," since decolonisation there has been a higher prominence of transnational companies (tncs) over state actors.
",
7080,1,," these tncs extract the mineral wealth and export these resources to the rest of the world.
",
7081,1,," despite the trade of resources from the continent, africa has arguably not benefitted.
",
7082,1,," this disparity between natural resources and economic development led jeffery sachs and andrew warner to the claim that there is a resources curse where, despite trade, africa has seen little development.
",
7083,1,," resources however are not destiny.
",
7084,1,," there is the possibility to benefit from mineral wealth, through better management of resources and greater transparency, mean that the presence of natural resource is positive.
",
7085,0,," corruption in african governance is a common feature of african governance , with resources being a major source of exploitation by the political class .
",
7086,0,," natural resources are often controlled by the government .
",
7087,0,," as resources fund the government 's actions rather than tax , there is a decrease in accountability to the citizenry which enables the government to abuse its ownership of this land to make profit .
",
7088,0,," to benefit from resource wealth , money from the exploitation of mineral wealth and other sources needs to be reinvested in to the country 's economy and human capital .
",
7089,0,," investing in infrastructure and education can encourage long term growth .
",
7090,0,," however a large amount of funds are pocketed by politicians and bureaucrats instead , hindering growth .
",
7091,0,," africa progress panel , app , conducted a survey on five mining deals betweenandin the democratic republic of congo , drc .
",
7092,0,," they found that the drc was selling off state-owned mining companies at low prices .
",
7093,0,," the new offshore owner would then resell the companies for much more , with much of the profit finding its way to drc government officials .
",
7094,0,," the profits were twice as high as the combined budget for education and health , demonstrating that corruption caused by resource exploitation detracts from any long term growth .
",
7095,0,," both licit and illicit resource extraction have caused ecological and environmental damage in africa .
",
7096,0,," the procurement of many natural resources requires processes such as mining and deforestation , which are harmful to the environment .
",
7097,0,," deforestation for access purposes , timber and cattle has led to around 3.4 million hectares of woodland being destroyed betweenandand , in turn , soil degradation .
",
7098,0,," as africa 's rainforest are necessary for global ecological systems , this is a significant loss .
",
7099,0,," mining and transportation also create damage through pollution and the scarring of the landscape .
",
7100,0,," mining produces various harmful chemicals which contaminate water and soil , a process which is worsened by illicit groups who cut corners to ensure higher profits .
",
7101,0,," the majority of investment in africa by trans national companies , tncs , goes towards resource extraction .
",
7102,0,," many companies use transfer pricing , tax avoidance and anonymous company ownership to increase profits at the expense of resource abundant nations .
",
7103,0,," production sharing agreements , where companies and states share in the profit of a venture , can often benefit the former over the latter .
",
7104,0,," inugandan activists sued the government for one such deal where the country was to likely to receive only half the profits rather than three quarters .
",
7105,0,," kofi annan , former united nations security general , has claimed that africa 's outflow of funds by tncs in the extractive industries is twice as high as inflows to the continent .
",
7106,0,," businesses such as barclays have been criticised for their promotion of tax havens in africa .
",
7107,0,," these allow tncs to avoid government taxation for projects such as resource extraction , a symptom of the attitude of foreign companies to investment in africa .
",
7108,0,," the unfavourable inflow/outflow balance prevents reinvestment in africa 's infrastructure , education and health services .
",
7109,0,," there is a strong connection between the presence of natural resources and conflict within africa .
",
7110,0,," natural resources , especially those with a high commodity price such as diamonds , are a useful means of funding rebellions and governments .
",
7111,0,," thecivil war in sierra leone became infamous for the blood diamonds which came from mines with forced slavery .
",
7112,0,," these diamonds were used to fund the revolutionary united front , ruf , for eleven years , extending the blood-shed .
",
7113,0,," continued conflict in the congo is also attributed to the control of mineral wealth and exemplifies how resources have negatively impacted africa .
",
7114,1,,"this centres around two crucial changes occurring across africa: technology and a youthful population.
",
7115,1,," the demographic transition, occurring internationally, showcases the rise of a ‘youth bulge’.
",
7116,1,," across the developing world statistics show youths will account for <25% of the population by 2020; and in africa the figures are higher.
",
7117,1,," in africa today, 70% of the population is underand byyouths (15-29) are projected to account for ~28% of the population.
",
7118,1,," in response to the identified demographic changes questions are being raised concerning why such trends are emerging; what youths are doing; why youths matter, and to what extent the rising young population present a resource for developing countries.
",
7119,1,," in focusing on youths in africa, two extreme discourses have emerged.
",
7120,1,," first, youths are being identified as entrepreneurs - they hold the resources, skills, and drive, to start up new businesses and markets.
",
7121,1,," as the world development report (2007) states, the increasing proportion of youths represents an untapped resource for africa.
",
7122,1,," secondly and alternatively, discussion on youths has also centered on their ‘dangerousness’.
",
7123,1,," youths have been defined, and branded, as criminals, violent actors, and leaders of conflict.
",
7124,1,," in this perspective, current projections of a ‘youth bulge’ in africa are a cause of concern and risk needing to be monitored, not opportunity.
",
7125,1,,"additionally, a technological shift across africa has received attention.
",
7126,1,," africa has gone digital, and is using technology to contribute to national gdps and create a new position within the global-economy.
",
7127,1,," over half of urban consumers have access to 'internet-capable devices'.
",
7128,1,," the emergence of technology, and mobile devices, across the continent is presenting new opportunities for productivity, social policy, and individual livelihoods.
",
7129,1,," however, to what extent is africa's 'technological revolution' a reality for all; is it the right technology; and can it change the perception of africa?
",
7130,1,," more importantly what is it being used for?
",
7131,1,,"in focusing on the role of technology this debate shifts focus to understand what changes will arise for young people across africa.
",
7132,1,," an entrepreneur reflects someone with innovative ideas and an ability to manage them in order to enhance the efficiency of a firm.
",
7133,1,," can technology provide a solution to create new jobs and more entrepreneurs?
",
7134,1,," can it integrate, and include, youths in society?
",
7135,1,," can the technology actually be used by youths to explore their talents, ambitions, and desires?
",
7136,0,," the rate of unemployment in sub-saharan africa remains above the global average , at 7.55 % in, with% of the population in vulnerable employment .
",
7137,0,," economic growth has not been inclusive and jobs are scarce .
",
7138,0,," in particular , rates of youth unemployment , and underemployment , remain a concern .
",
7139,0,," on average , the underutilisation of youths in the labour market across sub-saharan africa stood at% in, work4youth  .
",
7140,0,," therefore% of youths are either unemployed , inactive , or in irregular employment .
",
7141,0,," the rate of unemployment varies geographically and across gender .
",
7142,0,," there remains a high percentage of youths within informal employment .
",
7143,0,," technology can introduce a new dynamic within the job market and access to safer employment .
",
7144,0,," secure , high quality jobs , and more jobs , are essential for youths .
",
7145,0,," access to technology is the only way to meet such demands .
",
7146,0,," technology will enable youths to create new employment opportunities and markets ; but also employment through managing , and selling , the technology available .
",
7147,0,," a key technology for youths are mobile phones and devices .
",
7148,0,," across west and east africa the possession of mobile phones has enabled citizens to network and form solutions to social problems .
",
7149,0,," by, there are expected to bebillion mobile cellular subscriptions in sub-saharan africa , sambira  .
",
7150,0,," this is the first african generation directly accessing high-technology , although uncertainty remains in the amount of youths having access to technology .
",
7151,0,," through mobile phones new business opportunities , and flows of money , are being created .
",
7152,0,," furthermore , mobile phones are providing innovative solutions to health care treatment , ensuring better health for future entrepreneurs and youths .
",
7153,0,," slimtrader is a positive example .
",
7154,0,," slimtrader uses mobile phones to provide a range of vital services - from airplane and bus tickets to medicine .
",
7155,0,," the innovative e-commerce provides a space to advertise skills , products , and opportunities - to , on the one hand , identify new consumer demands ; and on another hand , create notices to exchange goods .
",
7156,0,," mobile technology is making it faster , quicker , and simpler to tap into new markets .
",
7157,0,," entrepreneurialism can be encouraged through an awareness , and sharing , of new ideas .
",
7158,0,," the technological revolution has provided a platform for personal expression , delivery of up-to-date news , and the vital sharing of local ideas and thoughts .
",
7159,0,," in nigeria the co-creation hub has emerged , encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit .
",
7160,0,," further , umuntu and mimiboards ' are connecting individual communities to the web by encouraging local content creation .
",
7161,0,," such platforms are enabling the transfer of knowledge and innovative ideas .
",
7162,0,," innovative solutions are being introduced to routine problems , such as ` mafuta go ' an app to find the best price for petrol , christine ampaire .
",
7163,0,," technology has enabled access to e-books and resources for students and teachers .
",
7164,0,," such changes have enabled improved efficiency in teaching , with the availability of up-to-date resources and awareness of relevant theories .
",
7165,0,," furthermore , the ease by which students are able to access multiple resources and buy books online is expanding their intellectual curiosity and library .
",
7166,0,," in addition to raising new students , technology can be seen as a tool for democracy .
",
7167,0,," technology provides a tool for government accountability , transparency in information , and for good governance .
",
7168,0,," organisations , such as ushahidi , crowdmapping , following kenya 'spost-election violence ; and mysociety which updates citizens on parliamentary proceedings in south africa , show how technology is feeding democratisation for youths .
",
7169,0,," technology has enabled the development of entrepreneurial ideas for business , but also within africa 's cultural industry .
",
7170,0,," access to video recording mobile phones , the internet , and televised publications has created a new culture of expression for african youths .
",
7171,0,," cultural industries are raising critical questions for politics , and empowering youth to tell their stories .
",
7172,0,," the use of journalism has become mobilised by youths - as seen in initiatives such as , african slum voices , of which are encouraging youths to pro-actively raise their opinions and voices on issues occurring within their communities .
",
7173,0,," furthermore , the music and film industry in africa has arisen as a result of access to new technologies at a lower-cost .
",
7174,0,," two key components responsible for the growth of nollywood , nigeria 's film industry , include access to digital technology and entrepreneurship .
",
7175,0,," youths have become vital within nollywood , as actors , producers and editors .
",
7176,0,," today nollywood 's low-budget films have inspired the growth of regional film industries across africa and contributed to its status as the third largest film industry .
",
7177,0,," nollywood 's revenue stand 's at around $ 200mn a year .
",
7178,1,,"traditionally, there has been a view that africa is a violent, dictator led, undeveloped continent.
",
7179,1,," extremes of poverty and weather, combined with exploitation, corruption and war are common themes when one thinks of africa.
",
7180,1,," conventionally seen as the least developed continent in the world, africa containsof theldcs (least developed countries).
",
7181,1,,"in recent years, however, a new narrative has gained popularity; one of ‘africa rising’.
",
7182,1,," as early as 2001, time magazine made the claim that a new narrative was emerging of an africa beginning to break the status quo.
",
7183,1,," this idea of africa ‘rising’ is a reference to the current strong economic growth and aiding factors such as democracy, development, and political stability.
",
7184,1,," national gdp, poverty, democracy indicators and education have all seen improvements in the majority of african countries, and africa is now being hailed as ‘the world’s next economic powerhouse’.
",
7185,1,," in the past few years this has become a dominant discourse when one discusses africa’s future.
",
7186,1,," there has, however, been a similar discourse in the past.
",
7187,1,," the 1960s during the wave of independence that swept the continent saw a similar euphoria about the future emerge, although the economic growth never materialised.
",
7188,1,,"the proposal is that this dominant discourse is correct in its assumptions that africa is emerging from its dark age.
",
7189,0,," africa has recently experienced some of the most significant economic growth in the world .
",
7190,0,," amongst the top ten growing economies in the world are five african countries ; the gambia , libya , mozambique , sierra leone , and south sudan .
",
7191,0,," the latter , south sudan , witnessed gdp growth of% in.
",
7192,0,," other economies in africa are also doing exceptionally well , such as ethiopia and ghana .
",
7193,0,," as ever , natural resources are a key export for these countries .
",
7194,0,," recent investments from china in exchange for africa 's abundant natural resources have enabled many african countries to develop at a significantly faster rate , with trade between the continent and china increasing by $billion .
",
7195,0,," all of this has contributed to an average gdp growth of 4.8 % in the past ten years .
",
7196,0,," there is a rapidly expanding middle-class and it is predicted that bythere will be overmillion africans living on $ 3,000 a year , showing an increasingly positive future for africa .
",
7197,0,," human development index , hdi , indicators are used to assess levels of life expectancy , education and income indices throughout the world .
",
7198,0,," the majority of african states have seen an improvement in these scores since, and are predicted to continue this trend .
",
7199,0,," some african states , such seychelles , libya and tunisia , are in the ` high human development ' category and are positioned in the topfor hdi indicators , an improvement from.
",
7200,0,," life expectancy has increased by% on the continent and infant mortality has decreased as well , thanks to the greater availability of mosquito nets and the attention given to hiv/aids .
",
7201,0,," education is seen as a cornerstone to growth as it allows the quicker attainment of the skills required for knowledge-intensive industries , such as agriculture and services , which will in turn lead to greater development .
",
7202,0,," the level of literacy in africa has seen an increase in reports on human development fromand.
",
7203,0,," finally , levels of poverty throughout africa have generally decreased , including in notable countries such as ghana and zimbabwe .
",
7204,0,," foreign investment into africa has seen a large increase in recent years , which has enabled africa to invest significant amounts of funding in to infrastructure , jobs creation and acquisition of technology .
",
7205,0,," in kenya , uganda and tanzania , foreign businesses account for a much larger percentage of employment than any domestic firm , hence increasing the standard of living for a greater number of people .
",
7206,0,," fdi has gone from $billion into $billion inand $billion in.
",
7207,0,," the vast majority of this investment is based on extractive industries such as agriculture and raw resources .
",
7208,0,," however , africa has recently seen an increase in fdi for manufacturing and services as well .
",
7209,0,," central africa alone received $billion in 2012-3 , due to an increased interest in the drc 's copper-cobalt mines .
",
7210,0,," the sources of this fdi vary , but china has become the major investor in the region , with investment rising from $billion to $billion in the past decade .
",
7211,0,," china has helped build vast infrastructure projects in return for natural resources and food for its growing population .
",
7212,0,," proponents of this view claim that the traditional image of ` dark africa ' is becoming outdated in the light of greater access to technology .
",
7213,0,," due to poor infrastructure , mobile communications have had a transformative impact on african life .
",
7214,0,," in the past decade there has been a notable increase in mobile phone ownership , with the trend set to continue .
",
7215,0,," there are overmillion mobile phone users in africa , which is more than in north america and europe .
",
7216,0,," mobile phones allow the use of services such as agro-info and mobile banking to further their businesses .
",
7217,0,," it is thought that by,% of households will have a television in their house .
",
7218,0,," household technologies becoming more available have gone hand in hand with the development of more sophisticated farming and industrial techniques .
",
7219,0,," a recent pan-african project designed at improving legume technology and enrich low-nitrogen soils has made it possible for farmers to increase their yields and has reached 250,000 smallholder farmers so far .
",
7220,1,,"it is clear that there are a lot of very serious issues that the african governments have to solve when dealing with the threats to the population’s security.
",
7221,1,,"  security can be narrowly or broadly defined but even when narrowly defined as protection against physical harms, such as military attacks coming from government forces or military juntas, poverty is still an issue that has a security impact.
",
7222,1,," the global poverty line is $1.25 a day and the rate of poverty inwas less than half therate.
",
7223,1,,"million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty inthan in 1990.
",
7224,1,," however, at the global level 1.2 billion people are still living in extreme poverty (1).
",
7225,1,," although in absolute numbers there are more people in poverty in south asia it is sub saharan africa which has the highest rate of poverty relative to the size of the population with 48.5% of the population in poverty.
",
7226,1,,"(2) so although poverty has diminished, it is still a very pressing issue.
",
7227,1,,"is poverty africa’s biggest security issue or is there another problem that is a bigger threat to public safety?
",
7228,1,," poverty does have consequences for security; it leaves people vulnerable to terrorist attacks and may encourage people to join terrorist organisations, something that is even more pronounced with piracy, banditry and rebellions.
",
7229,1,," however even if it is a security issue it may be considered to be a diminishing one as the continent is becoming richer.
",
7230,1,," perhaps the most obvious alternative general explanation for conflict in africa are ethno-religious divides.
",
7231,1,," there are tensions for resources and power between ethnicities and religion often adds to the volatile mix.
",
7232,1,," while there is no one overarching problem that if it is solved will somehow solve all of africa’s problems identifying the general causes of conflicts is important in working out how to avoid such conflict in the future.
",
7233,1,," the solution to the problem will be very different if poverty is the main problem compared to if ethnicity and religion is.
",
7234,1,,"n.b. while this debate is about africa it is also a general debate that can apply everywhere with similar conditions of poverty and a diversity of religions and ethnic groups.
",
7235,0,," the examples for this debate are drawn from a wide range of countries some of which are outside of africa.
",
7236,0,,"despite many problems that africa has to face , one of the biggest is its extreme poverty .
",
7237,0,," currently more than 48.5 % of the population of sub-saharan africa lives on less than 1.25 dollars a day  .
",
7238,0,," as a result of this poverty people 's security is being threatened on two main levels .
",
7239,0,," on the first level of analysis , poverty can lead to crime .
",
7240,0,," poverty can create desperation to provide for family or yourself .
",
7241,0,," as poverty is widespread in africa , there are many people who are willing to steal , threaten , abduct or kill someone , in order to have something to eat .
",
7242,0,," at 17.4 per 100,000 citizens , more than double the world average , africa has the highest homicide rate among all regions of the world .
",
7243,0,,"  the other side of this is that a poor state ca n't provide the level of policing that richer states can , a people in poverty usually results in a poor government .
",
7244,0,," this in turn means that the police force is small , badly trained and underfunded so not fit for preventing crime .
",
7245,0,," on the second level of analysis , desperate people are much easier to manipulate .
",
7246,0,," this makes them easy targets for military groups in africa who are searching for members to fight for their causes .
",
7247,0,," it is not coincidental that we have so many militias and juntas in africa , such as somali pirates , aqap , aqim , al-shabab , touareg , mali , boko haram , nigeria , m23 and dozens of others .
",
7248,0,," the militias offer those in poverty what they need most , food , shelter , and protection in return for their `` services '' .
",
7249,0,," poverty provides an additional benefit for these groups due to the stark difference between potential reward , such as from piracy or winning control of mines , and a normal income .
",
7250,0,," as with the drugs trade the lure of the fast buck can be used to encourage risk-taking .
",
7251,0,," in conclusion , poverty both enables crime and encourages militia groups .
",
7252,0,," unfortunately , there is a vicious circle , caused by poverty that many poor countries find themselves in .
",
7253,0,," a poor country also means a poor , ill-funded government .
",
7254,0,," such an institution is either unhelpful in preventing poverty or a road block to poverty alleviation .
",
7255,0,," a poor population is also unfortunately more likely to lead to an autocratic government .
",
7256,0,," this phenomenon can be shown by looking at decolonisation .
",
7257,0,," poor countries when decolonised , even if they initially had democratic aspirations quickly fell to dictatorship .
",
7258,0,," there are very few exceptions such as india that have managed to continually maintain a democratic government while poor .
",
7259,0,," wealthy countries when decolonised are much more likely to become democracies and once poor autocracies become rich the pressure for democratisation usually becomes unstoppable so countries like south korea democratised as they became wealthy .
",
7260,0,," there might be considered to be a wealth threshold about which states will become democracies .
",
7261,0,,"  the reason why poverty is likely to lead to dictatorship is simple ; a lack of an educated , effective civil service .
",
7262,0,," when the government is very small it ca n't effectively control the whole country or ensure accountability .
",
7263,0,," the result , especially when civil servants are poorly paid is corruption and an opening for the army , or any populist who appears to offer a solution to take power .
",
7264,0,," once dictatorship occurs it can usually be maintained by force until the population is educated and connected enough to engage in a democratic revolution .
",
7265,0,," there is then a free pass for those in power to exploit their position through corruption .
",
7266,0,," many dictators , including in africa have become very rich indeed .
",
7267,0,," mohammed suharto , ferdinand marcos and mobutu sese seko , the former dictators of indonesia , the philippines , and dr congo , extorted up to $ 50bn , # 28bn , from their impoverished people  .
",
7268,0,," a vicious cycle is created whereby the government needs money , so corruption and extortion are rampant .
",
7269,0,," those in power are more concerned with their own wealth than the people which makes the government poorer and less efficient so providing more incentive to resort to illicit means of funding .
",
7270,0,," poor nations find it difficult to sustain efficient and well-disciplined armies .
",
7271,0,," good training and regular pay is vital for this , something that is unlikely to be forthcoming with a cash strapped government .
",
7272,0,," yet such a disciplined army is one of the vital prerequisites for security and a stable country .
",
7273,0,," discipline is needed to prevent the army turning on those it is supposed to protect , and it is need to secure the country from other groups both internal and external .
",
7274,0,," poverty therefore enables rebellions , civil wars , and local warlords by helping ensure that the poor states involved do n't have the resources to control their territories .
",
7275,0,," it should come as no surprise that ofmajor ongoing conflicts five are on the african continent , and another one if the conflict in dr congo were to be included despite it potentially being at an end .
",
7276,0,,"  in addition to this , a poorly funded army is a threat in itself , as the lack of training of the soldiers may translate into unprofessional behaviour , such as engaging in crimes and rapes , or even worse launching a full scale coup in the hope that they will grip the power .
",
7277,1,,"nato, the north atlantic treaty organisation, is a military alliance based on the north atlantic treaty.
",
7278,1,," it was founded inby twelve allied countries including the united states, the united kingdom, canada and france, originally with the intention to provide collective security for europe against the soviet-led communist bloc.
",
7279,1,," in response, the soviet union formed the warsaw pact in 1955, a rival collective security organisation led by the soviet union.
",
7280,1,,"when the soviet union collapsed, the warsaw pact disintegrated, but nato continued existing.
",
7281,1,," in fact, inand 2004, it expanded with many new members who originally were a member of that same rival warsaw pact, including poland (1999) and the baltic countries (estonia, latvia, lithuania, 2004).
",
7282,1,,"through membership of nato, all member countries commit themselves to ‘mutual defense’.
",
7283,1,," this means that all member states commit to assist another member when it comes under attack.
",
7284,1,," formally, this assistance isn’t necessarily military, but in practice it is assumed it means military assistance.
",
7285,1,," this idea of ‘an attack against one is an attack against all’ under nato was invoked only once, after the attacks of september 11,on the u.s.the members of nato hold regular military exercises together, with the aim to improve coordination and cooperation between their respective militaries.
",
7286,1,," nato also issues so-called stanags (standardized agreements) which harmonize rules, procedures and equipment of the militaries of all members.
",
7287,1,,"next to that, nato also runs the membership actions plans (map).
",
7288,1,," countries can request to receive a map, which is a plan to put them on course to eventually joining nato as a full member.
",
7289,1,," bosnia & herzegovina, macedonia and montenegro all have maps.
",
7290,1,," georgia has expressed interest for a map and ukraine expressed interest until 2010.
",
7291,0,,"  originally , nato had a clearly defined purpose and a common enemy : the soviet bloc .
",
7292,0,," with the demise of that shared enemy , nato 's original purpose has disappeared but its well-functioning military structure remained , leaving it open to be seized by opportunistic politicians in a classic case of ` scope creep ' .
",
7293,0,," this has happened with u.s. president george bush jr. 's push to let ukraine and georgia in as new members in his global campaign to spread democracy .
",
7294,0,," this has only served to increase tensions with russia , see next argument .
",
7295,0,," who is to say that something similar is n't going to happen vis-à-vis china ?
",
7296,0,," there are two issues keeping russia cautious of nato as a military alliance .
",
7297,0,," the first is a proposal by the u.s. to put up a missile defence system in poland , the czech republic and on warships in the black sea under the flag of nato to protect against missiles from iran or north korea , which , according to russia , would never fly over these countries in any attack .
",
7298,0,," russia concludes that the missile defence system therefore must be directed at them .
",
7299,0,," the second issue is nato 's plans to expand with ukraine and georgia , which russia has traditionally regarded as part of their ` sphere of influence ' .
",
7300,0,," as russian president medvedev stated in: `` no state can be pleased about having representatives of a military bloc to which it does not belong coming close to its borders . ''
",
7301,0,," the clause that ` an attack against one means an attack against all ' , article v , runs the risk of entangling the entire alliance in an unwanted conflict .
",
7302,0,," this has happened before : world war i started out as a local conflict between the austro-hungarian empire and serbia , but through their security alliances inadvertently drew in all the major powers of the world .
",
7303,0,," given that many members of nato have unstable countries near their borders , i.e. turkey bordering iraq , there is a risk they could become involved in a small regional war , which then inadvertently draws in the entire world .
",
7304,0,," maintaining an administration for nato , with personnel and buildings , costs money .
",
7305,0,," moreover , whenever nato-members engage in a mission , they 're supposed to fund their activities under these missions themselves .
",
7306,0,," given that the original threat has passed and given that the organisation still struggles to redefine itself , why spend money on it ?
",
7307,1,,"development is the sustained increase in standards of living of a country.
",
7308,1,," there however is no individual indicator that shows that a country is considered developed.
",
7309,1,," the proxy that is usually used is gross domestic product per capita which is the total amount a nation produces divided by the country’s population.
",
7310,1,," this then captures the relative performance of nations and usually shows how developed a nation is.
",
7311,1,," what it does not show however is how equally that wealth from that output is divided so it is possible that a nation that is very rich by gdp is actually not very developed if all of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of one or two people, an example of this is equatorial guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty.
",
7312,1,," dissatisfaction with this has led to the development of the human development index for the development reports of the united nations development programme.
",
7313,1,," these include a broader range of indicators using gross national income per capita (only slightly different from gdp) with purchasing power parity (meaning it takes in to consideration differences in prices for the same product) as a wealth component.
",
7314,1,," it also includes life expectancy at birth for a health component, and mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling to create an educated component.
",
7315,1,," the index is sometimes improved by adjusting for inequalities between the three.
",
7316,1,," in either case countries tend to be categorised into very high, high, medium (with this being split into lower and upper middle in the world bank’s) and low.
",
7317,1,," a country might be said to be fully developed when it reaches high.
",
7318,1,," development however might simply be taken as the movement between these categories.
",
7319,1,,"dictatorship does not automatically result in development – an increase in human wellbeing, which can be evidenced by improved education, health, lifestyles and security.
",
7320,1,," neither does democracy.
",
7321,1,," there are cases both of democracies that have failed to develop, such as india and bangladesh, and there are a lot of instances where autocracies have failed to develop.
",
7322,1,," on the opposite side of the coin there are both cases where democracies have developed such as many western countries; the uk, us, france, and cases where states have developed under a more autocratic system such as south korea, singapore, and most recently china.
",
7323,1,," it is china that is the driving force behind current debates on whether dictatorships might be better than democracies at encouraging at least the initial stages of growth.
",
7324,1,,"  there are however both advantages and disadvantages to each system when it comes to encouraging development.
",
7325,1,," a dictatorship has greater control over people and resources allowing for more state driven economic growth, making it in a better position to develop than a democratic state.
",
7326,1,," this is most evident in early stages of development where development is based on the production of goods.
",
7327,1,," this will explore whether dictatorships are more likely to develop then democracies.
",
7328,0,," dictatorships are superior to democracies in that they can make decisions and implement policies quicker .
",
7329,0,," they can easily modify institutional and legal frameworks towards development goals , as there is no need for a political consensus behind their actions .
",
7330,0,," this also insulates government from special interests that must be reconciled with in democracies .
",
7331,0,," this allows dictatorships to create a pro-investment legal , economic and institutional framework such as low taxes , exchange rate manipulations and import tariffs , without facing political opposition .
",
7332,0,," for example , fracking , a technique used to extract hard to obtain gas , has generated widespread opposition in the west , leading to it being banned in france .
",
7333,0,," an autocratic government would find it easier to allow cheap access to this energy , boosting industry , as it could disregard this opposition .
",
7334,0,," dictatorships can also control resources to allow for better health and education services , by determining curricula , salaries and supplies .
",
7335,0,," cuba has one of the best healthcare systems in the world , with more doctors per capita than much of the western world , and inshanghai came first in the pisa test .
",
7336,0,," due to the lack of rotation in office , a dictatorship allows for a more stable government with more ability to plan for the long term , which is crucial for attracting foreign investment .
",
7337,0,," given that a democracy requires regular elections , each election can change the economic environment of a country .
",
7338,0,," a change in government may lead to a switch in policies , partisan appointments to government bodies , and a medium term focus always set on the next election .
",
7339,0,," close elections can lead to disorder as votes are recounted and appeals lodged in the courts .
",
7340,0,," after themexican presidential election , tight results lead to popular unrest and mass protests calling for a recount .
",
7341,0,," the president elect had to deal with a large legislative faction that did not recognise him , and his opponent refused to concede defeat .
",
7342,0,," without a stable framework , the lack of foreign confidence may impede development .
",
7343,0,," the countries that have developed rapidly have tended to be those that have managed to attract this foreign direct investment thus inchina managed to get $billion of fdi ,% of the total , against only $billion for the united states which is still a much bigger economy .
",
7344,0,," additionally the resources needed to operate a democratic society and run elections are a large expense for the state and society as a whole ; the us presidential election costs $ 6bn , money which would be much better spent investing in building infrastructure or businesses .
",
7345,0,," dictatorships are better at controlling discipline and order within society .
",
7346,0,," they generally promote a state based on hierarchical values , through strict policies based on security .
",
7347,0,," this allows them to prevent financial losses due to strikes and riots , and reduce crime rates , making the country more stable .
",
7348,0,," singapore is a de-facto one party state , in which the ruling people 's action party , is accused of stopping the operation of opposition parties .
",
7349,0,," a former foreign minister of singapore has asked `` how many singaporeans really want free speech anyway ?
",
7350,0,," they want orderliness , a decent living '' .
",
7351,0,," this both makes the country more competitive because there are more productive days and more attractive to invest in as expats will want to live in countries with little crime .
",
7352,0,," moreover when it comes to attracting immigration for sectors of the economy there is none of the opposition that would occur in democracies .
",
7353,0,," autocracy may be the only way to stabilize some countries that have never had a democratic government .
",
7354,0,," it has been suggested by mancur olson , a leading economist , that `` anarchy not only involves loss of life but also increases the incentives to steal and to defend against theft , and thereby reduces the incentive to produce '' .
",
7355,0,," a dictatorship may be the only way to restore order and create a political framework stable enough for trade and investment .
",
7356,1,,"the european union has since its inception had european integration beyond trade as its overarching goal.
",
7357,1,," in recent years, it has moved towards an increasingly closer political union.
",
7358,1,," many political competences that used to belong to nations have been transferred to permanent eu institutions such as the council of the eu, the european parliament, and the european commission.
",
7359,1,," in other words, the eu has gained increasing legislative and fiscal power, so that member states and their citizens are legally bound to follow eu laws which span increasingly contentious areas.
",
7360,1,," these include budget regulations through the maastricht criteria, but go beyond them: it is hard to think of an area of policy where the eu is not active (1).
",
7361,1,," the eu is therefore already a political union.
",
7362,1,,"since the beginning of the euro crisis, there has been pressure from some member states, and notably germany and france, to move towards an ever closer political union (2).
",
7363,1,," although they don’t yet exist common fiscal policies and a banking union can be seen as prerequisites to a sustainable eurozone – but shared education and law enforcement policies are also important for trade and interaction within the eu.
",
7364,1,," further political integration is therefore being considered as a possible response to the crisis in the eurozone.
",
7365,1,,"however, this sentiment is not shared by all.
",
7366,1,," disillusionment is spreading, the uk has for years had eurosceptic parties who want to go back to a trade bloc at most that do well in european elections, but the rise of alternative für deutschland even a book by a book by a former champion of european integration françois heisbourg suggests that the eu may need to put integration into reverse.
",
7367,1,," eu legislation is perceived by many as an intrusion on national sovereignty and as an obstacle to democracy.
",
7368,1,," some find it especially unwise to sacrifice their sovereignty for economic benefits, when they believe they end up losing both and having to bail out weaker economies.
",
7369,1,," an alternative to the status quo is for the european union to limit itself to being merely a trade bloc where its member countries remove barriers to trade between each other (such as tariffs).
",
7370,1,," this would maintain the key economic benefits of cooperation and make europe more competitive, without alienating its members.
",
7371,1,," in essence, the alternative of a trade bloc would mean preserving the single market, where people, services, and goods can move freely, while repatriating other powers currently at eu level to national governments.
",
7372,1,,"the single market has been highly beneficial to the eu, and it is mostly unquestioned that it should remain (3).
",
7373,1,," but can the eu succeed as a trade bloc without integration in other areas?
",
7374,1,," trade blocs exist worldwide that are reasonably successful without the involvement of a political union: nafta is one example.
",
7375,0,," but are they really successful, and could the same policy apply to the eu?
",
7376,0,,"the eu is too large for a democratic structure .
",
7377,0,," since it deals not with citizens directly but with member states , a question arises as to which agents should make fundamental decisions .
",
7378,0,," should every member state get an equal vote , or a vote in proportion to the size of its population ?
",
7379,0,," if nation states get equal votes , a lot of people in larger states such as germany , france or spain may find themselves highly disenfranchised .
",
7380,0,," on the other hand , if states get votes in proportion to the size of its population , countries such as luxembourg will be forever hesitant to join , and rightly so , for its citizens would most likely be excluded .
",
7381,0,," the democratic deficit in the eu is no less visible in practice .
",
7382,0,," the commission is not directly elected  ; council politics are confusing , take a long time , and grind to a halt whenever germany is in the middle of elections  ; and the voting turnout for european elections , where meps are elected , is too low to be considered a fair representation of voters ' views  .
",
7383,0,," this poses a problem the moment the eu begins having legislative power in its member states : we must not let more and more aspects of citizen 's lives be affected by an institution that is increasingly undemocratic .
",
7384,0,," many of the policies of the political union intrude on national legislation .
",
7385,0,," in many cases , eu policies go against national traditions or redefine laws that were already functional .
",
7386,0,," occasionally eu policies even cause direct harm , when countries have less freedom to tailor them to their own conditions .
",
7387,0,," during the past few years , the commission 's powers have included monitoring member states implementation of austerity policies in return for bailouts .
",
7388,0,," however , everyone , including the imf , agrees that austerity was unsuccessful and has seriously hampered recovery  .
",
7389,0,," being a part of a political union inevitably means that sacrifices have to be made and this often intrudes on national sovereignty by reducing he room for manoeuvre of national governments .
",
7390,0,," intrusion by the eu would be justified if it creates substantially better laws or solid trade benefits ; however , regulations on the shape of cucumbers  do neither of these .
",
7391,0,," the eu should not have legislative power on these areas .
",
7392,0,," the european project has gone too far for many european countries .
",
7393,0,," for some such as norway or switzerland the eu has already gone far past the amount of integration they would be willing to allow .
",
7394,0,," even member states are increasingly finding that the eu 's intrusiveness and the cost of supporting smaller economies outweigh any potential benefit .
",
7395,0,," britain has expressed this discontent particularly strongly .
",
7396,0,,"  this is a problem for the european union .
",
7397,0,," the problem of its alienated member states is only likely to get worse as it seeks to continue expanding : new countries will have increasingly divergent values and will be harder to integrate while deepening will mean more countries are left behind .
",
7398,0,," in practice , this means that the eu will face massive barriers to its goal of integration , and compromise all its other goals in the process .
",
7399,0,," the best solution then is to go back to a stage in the eu 's development that every country supports ; the single market without the politics attached .
",
7400,0,," this would bring the benefit of encouraging those who have been left out like norway and switzerland to join .
",
7401,0,," the european area only consists of liberal democracies , which consistently honour their agreements .
",
7402,0,," while historically a political union might have been necessary to further strengthen the coal and steel treaty , the eu as it originated , between recently belligerent states , these countries can now obtain the benefit of the trade union through multilateral agreements .
",
7403,0,," they simply have to regulate protectionism and tariffs so countries can remain competitive and barriers to trade remain low .
",
7404,0,," in the event that a country does not comply , the external pressure from the other countries , together with soft sanctions , is more than enough to keep the trade bloc functional .
",
7405,1,,"june and julybrought a large number of revelations about the size of surveillance by the national security agency, the us intelligence agency that deals with monitoring communications around the world.
",
7406,1,," while it was known that the internet was monitored it was not known to what extent, the leaks showed that such surveillance was indiscriminate essentially hovering in much of the internet for analysis, so much that the data is often held for only a few days.
",
7407,1,," the revelations also applied to other countries agencies such as the uk’s government communications headquarters.
",
7408,1,,"on the 5th june a court order by the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court was published.
",
7409,1,," this showed that verizon was being forced to hand over all telephony metadata to the national security agency.
",
7410,1,," this included “session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, international mobile subscriber identity (imsi) number, international mobile station equipment identity (imei) number, etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers, and time and duration of call… [however] metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication”.
",
7411,1,,"this was however just the start.
",
7412,1,," a program called prism was revealed the next day.
",
7413,1,," the prism program allows collection of data on via a large number online services run by us companies including microsoft, google, yahoo, and facebook among others.
",
7414,1,," the companies provide structured information that is easy for the nsa to search and analyse through the prism program.
",
7415,1,,"a couple of months later information of another program called xkeyscore were published in the guardian newspaper.
",
7416,1,," xkeyscore is apparently the nsa’s widest reaching system that covers ""nearly everything a typical user does on the internet"", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.
",
7417,1,," this is a data retrieval system that lets the nsa search other sources, particularly all the unstructured information they hoover up from tapping into the fiber optic cables that enter and leave the united states allowing access to almost all internet traffic.
",
7418,1,,"the response to this spying has of course been outrage, but most of that outrage has been internal; that the spying is so indiscriminate it means that the national security agency is spying on americans and so breaching their fourth amendment rights.
",
7419,1,," however no one is particularly bothered about whether the united states should be using these programs against other countries – the implicit assumption is yes it should.
",
7420,1,,"the united states clearly gets an immense amount of data out of its dragnets of information on the internet but what is more questionable is whether such programs are actually a benefit to the country.
",
7421,1,," most nations manage with much smaller amounts of worldwide surveillance and there was outrage across many countries at the extent of the surveillance.
",
7422,1,," the actions of the nsa have therefore both benefited the united states; they provide the benefit of being able to track almost anyone but the cost in terms of lost trust and damaged relations with the rest of the world.
",
7423,0,," trust is important in international relations .
",
7424,0,," whenever there is an international agreement each side has to trust that the other side will fulfil its side of the bargain ; there is no court to step in and ensure that they do .
",
7425,0,," trust therefore needs to be built up .
",
7426,0,," a large part of this is simply fulfilling promises that have been made in such treaties but trust can also be about being open with each other .
",
7427,0,," when a country engages in an immense spying operation against another nation it is clearly damaging the trust between those nations .
",
7428,0,," with the united states this is just one in a long line of issues that have undermined trust in the us government ; the iraq war , guantanamo bay , drone strikes etc. and the continued violations of international law these represent have all undermined trust in the united states internationally .
",
7429,0,," every country needs friends and historically the united states has managed to maintain a large number of close relationships with states around the world ; it has alliances with various asian states such as south korea and japan , with many middle eastern states , and with almost the whole of europe .
",
7430,0,," the nsa 's spying has damaged these relationships .
",
7431,0,," french president hollande said `` we can not accept this kind of behavior from partners and allies , '' while the president of the european parliament , martin schulz complained `` the united states of america treats its closest partners , including germany for example , but also the european union as a whole like hostile powers '' .
",
7432,0,," there have even been suggestions that this would jeopardise trade talks as warned by the commissioner viviane reding that `` if there is any doubt that our partners are bugging the offices of european negotiators , then the future trade talks could be in difficulty '' .
",
7433,0,," the united states , along with europe , has been the key voice arguing for freedom on the internet and in particular that the internet should not be controlled nationally .
",
7434,0,," russia and china in particular have been advocating for much more control over the internet by states with russia 's proposal advocating that `` member states shall have equal rights to manage the internet '' and `` member states shall have the sovereign right to establish and implement public policy ... on matters of internet governance , and to regulate the national internet segment '' .
",
7435,0,," essentially every state should have the right to censor and surveil their chunk of the internet .
",
7436,0,," with the united states already doing this countries that have previously been wavering may be much more inclined to support these proposals over us objections .
",
7437,0,," the us would stand to lose out as it is currently the country with most control over internet governance .
",
7438,0,," the united states is the preponderant power in internet commerce ; most of the big internet companies , the big software companies , even many of the hardware companies are companies that are based in the united states .
",
7439,0,," this both enables us use of these systems for spying as occurred with prism because it happens that most web traffic passes through the united states , and makes the united states vulnerable when the world 's consumers think these companies have been betraying their trust .
",
7440,0,," if consumers do n't think us companies can guarantee their data and privacy it should be no surprise that they will consider transferring their business .
",
7441,0,," cloud computing is particularly affected , among the revelations has been that microsoft helps the nsa with access to its cloud storage service skydrive .
",
7442,0,," according to a survey by the cloud security alliance% of non us responders had cancelled a project with us based providers since the leaks about nsa projects and% say they would be less likely to use a us based service .
",
7443,0,," the information technology & innovation foundation estimates this could cost the us cloud computing industry between $ 21.5 and $ 35bln in revenues over the next three years .
",
7444,0,," and this is just one part of the computing and software industries , other areas are likely to be less affected but may well still lose business .
",
7445,1,,"what started as a simple protest in februarygained momentum to be one of the most crucial revolutions that attracted the world’s attention.
",
7446,1,," onfebin the libyan city of benghazi,protesters came to the streets to show support of human rights activist farthi terbil detained by the government [1].
",
7447,1,," the move was despised by the leadership of col. gadhafi which proclaimed that the government was not and would never be apologetic on issues concerning the detention of people who were seen as enemies of the state.
",
7448,1,,"after only three days, the peaceful demonstrations turned to chaos with protesters clashing with security forces leavingcivilians killed, this prompted similar demonstrations in various cities of the country.
",
7449,1,,"on 6th march, after losing government control in misrata, tobruk, zawiya, brega, benghazi, and other significant population centres, gaddafi launched a counteroffensive campaign to regain control [2].
",
7450,1,,"the government used force to displace the protesters who were determined to end dictatorial leadership in the country, tanks were used to shell people and buildings, many were injured and others killed by these attacks raising fears of a massacre if gaddafi was to regain control, particularly of the second city benghazi, a move that sparked western involvement.
",
7451,1,," pressure from france, us, and the uk for intervention forced the security council to approve a resolution for protecting civilians.
",
7452,1,," on 17th march, a no fly zone was passed to prevent government air attacks on protesters but some arab and key western governments notably britain, france, and the u.s., took more aggressive measures in support of the rebels.
",
7453,0,," these ranged from on-the-ground training to supplying arms, providing real-time tactical intelligence and a bombing campaign, until tripoli fell in late august and gaddafi was killed two months later[3].
",
7454,0,,"gaddafi was an oppressive ruler who led libya foryears .
",
7455,0,," the country had no parliament , political parties , or ngo 's and no civil society  .
",
7456,0,," he ruled libya with an iron fist , eliminating any political opposition , restricting people 's rights and worst of all supporting different terrorist groups around the world .
",
7457,0,," the same man was responsible for thebombing of a pan am jet over lockerbie , scotland , which killedpeople  and he supported the leadership of iddi amin a dictator who killed masses in uganda .
",
7458,0,," his leadership posed a threat not only to libya but to countries around the world .
",
7459,0,," western intervention in the libyan civil war paved a clear path for the downfall of gaddafi 's rule .
",
7460,0,," we should consider the downfall of such a dictator to be a success and benefit to libya and all who gaddafi threatened .
",
7461,0,," from the day of the uprising in benghazi , the government was committed to fight back till the end .
",
7462,0,," gaddafi asserted that he will chase down the protesters and cleanse house by house while his son said that rivers of blood would flow with thousands of deaths , if the uprising did n't stop  .
",
7463,0,," military jets and helicopter gunships were indiscriminately unleashed upon people who had no means to defend themselves against assault from the air .
",
7464,0,," the resolution of a no fly zone passed by the security council weakened and prevented government forces from killing people and destroying cities using air strikes  .
",
7465,0,," air strikes went on to destroy artillery , armor and other weapons that could be used for indiscriminate attacks .
",
7466,0,," the intervention therefore stopped large scale civilian bloodshed .
",
7467,0,," the uprising sparked off as a concern for freedom in the country , people were tired of the oppressive regime and wanted to be liberated .
",
7468,0,," this could not happen by people power alone ; gaddafi was willing to crack down to prevent it like assad in syria did .
",
7469,0,," western intervention in the civil war helped the citizens gain power and force to fight for their rights , by providing them with training , intelligence and logistics among others hence ejecting the oppressive leadership a symbol for liberation .
",
7470,0,," after the civil war , people were able to participate in an election of the national assembly considered free and fair for the first time in libya  .
",
7471,0,," the part of the mo ibrahim index that rates participation and human rights rose from% into 30.5 % in .
",
7472,0,," more democratic and accountable government institutions have been set up , ngo 's welcomed and civil society empowered .
",
7473,0,," libya is becoming much freer with freedom house upgrading the country from ` not free ' to ` partially free '  .
",
7474,1,,"in 2012, gabon, along with equatorial guinea, hosted the africa cup of nations, the primary international football competition in africa.
",
7475,1,," both nations held an equal number of matches, with gabon holding the final, and equatorial guinea the bronze medal match and opening game.
",
7476,1,," these two relatively small countries (equatorial guinea with a population under one million, and gabon under two million) hosted the tournament for the first time, previous host nations including angola (whose tournament inwas marred by the attack on the bus carrying the togo team to cabinda), ghana and egypt.
",
7477,1,," gabon, whose share of matches included the final, was perhaps more of a sporting success than imagined: both host nations reached the quarter finals.
",
7478,1,," a number of key african footballing powerhouses, such as nigeria, south africa, egypt, cameroon and algeria failed to qualify.
",
7479,1,," the two nations were selected as hosts in 2006.
",
7480,1,,"high profile sporting events are always controversial because of their expense and the coverage they bring if nothing else.
",
7481,1,," while not on the same scale as the olympic games or the world cup (which has been hosted within africa: south africa in 2010), the africa cup of nations is the most high profile truly african event, not only receiving extensive coverage within the continent but also outside the region, including in the uk.
",
7482,1,," while both countries are of medium development as per (non inequality adjusted) un human development index figures, a particular focus was put on the human rights record on both nations, in particular that of gabon’s co-hosts, equatorial guinea.
",
7483,0,," the benefits of hosting these events for african nations include the ability to concentrate on infrastructure for the event .
",
7484,0,," in addition to sporting infrastructure , which could last well in excess ofyears , homes , hospitals , roads and schools have been constructed in gabon 's host cities .
",
7485,0,," the chinese government assisted funding of some of this ; it co-financed and helped construct the stade de l’amitié-sino-gabonaise , the biggest stadium .
",
7486,0,," the benefits of these events , unlike hosting an event such as an olympic games , which would be outside the reach of gabon or equatorial guinea , especially with the increasing trend of the ioc to select major world cities in medium or high income countries , is that more than one site in a country can host different parts of the tournament .
",
7487,0,," this provides a platform for a focus on broad based development across the entire nation , rather than one-sideded development focused on one city .
",
7488,0,," in gabon 's case there was both construction of the stade de l’amitié-sino-gabonaise in the capital and a rebuild of a stadium in franceville for $ 76.2 million .
",
7489,0,," there is a big benefit for small businesses in hosting the large sporting events .
",
7490,0,," the hosting of the tournament inhas been credited by african economic outlook with playing a role in the `` robust '' economic growth in the country in that year turning the country around from negative growth in.
",
7491,0,," theafrica cup of nations was credited with 10,000 jobs and helping the tourist sectors of the south african economy , gabon would have received a similar boost .
",
7492,1,,"with the lisbon treaty reforms, the eu has sought, amongst other things, to strengthen and to streamline its common foreign and security policy (cfsp) and to develop further its common security and defense policy (csdp).
",
7493,1,," as part of this, the post of high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy (hr) has been joined with that of first vice president of the commission (vp) responsible for external relations (including development and relations between the eu and neighbouring states to the east and south).
",
7494,1,," the holder of this post (hrvp), currently baroness catherine ashton, acts on the basis of agreement within the commission and unanimous agreement between all the eu foreign ministers.
",
7495,1,," her stated goal is to steer the eu foreign policy agenda and represent the eu as a united front.
",
7496,1,," with this post – as well as that of the european council president – the eu will have partially answered the question: if we want to talk to europe, who do we call?
",
7497,1,," the creation of the post of hrvp is a culmination of a number of different efforts to turn the initial project for a common foreign and security policy (cfsp) – adopted under the maastricht treaty in– into a workable, better integrated policy that is able to respond to international crises more quickly and to present a united front to the world on behalf of the eu.
",
7498,1,," it is a direct response to both internal and external criticisms that the eu has had to face over the lastyears in its handling of a variety of international crises; the breakup of the former yugoslavia, the ‘war on terror’ and theinvasion of iraq.
",
7499,1,," with bigger budgetary and diplomatic powers - including the creation of a dedicated eu diplomatic service (the european external action service) -   the newly strengthened post of hrvp may set the stage for the creation of an increasingly stronger political union along practical rather than rhetorical lines.
",
7500,0,," the eu has slowly been building up its own common military framework , with the uk and france leading the effort to pool european military capacity .
",
7501,0,," in addition , the eu itself has created new institutional bodies such as the political and security committee , a military committee and military staff .
",
7502,0,," the eu has had military envoys in macedonia and bosnia-herzegovina and has committed itself to the creation of a common security and defense policy with 3-4 ,000 troops on permanent standby in multilateral ` battlegroups ' ready for immediate deployment , see rockwell schnabel 's article listed below ,.
",
7503,0,," while incremental , these are steps not to be ignored .
",
7504,0,," the union has also placed that military capacity within the broader context of a security strategy designed to promote international peace , justice and development .
",
7505,0,," while the new ` eu high representative for foreign and security policy ' marks only a bold first step towards a more unified voice for the eu , the decisions are indeed still based on a state by state consultation mechanism -- hence the name representative .
",
7506,0,," this should however not to be downplayed as a less significant change in how the eu approaches its foreign policy .
",
7507,0,," the consultation aspect is in fact essential to reaching agreement and the importance of not only presenting a united front to the rest of the world , the eu is exemplary in trade policy and environmental policy , but less important when it comes to presenting a united voice in foreign policy as belgian foreign minister mark eyskens put it in`` europe is an economic giant , a political dwarf , and a military worm '', but also creating a united front through collaboration and debate .
",
7508,0,," one should thus see this not only as a means to an end , but rather as an important mechanism in itself , whereby new identities are slowly created along with a deeper sense of commitment to a common set of values .
",
7509,0,," the creation of a post of high representative and vice president of the commission , hrvp , marks an important change in the decision making process at the eu level with regards to foreign policy .
",
7510,0,," agreement on the post showed a clear commitment to the pursuit of a common eu foreign policy and to developing a unique cooperative model for foreign and defense policy decision making that goes beyond the nation state .
",
7511,0,," member states should now deliver on that commitment by seeking as much common ground as possible to ensure that the high representative 's role is truly significant .
",
7512,0,," the goal of a common foreign and security policy should thus be supported not only as a mechanism to streamline eu 's position and role in world politics , but also to reinforce notions of cooperation and consultation essential for maintaining a stable international system , in line with the stated goals of the eu .
",
7513,0,," , thestars in a circle is meant to symbolize the ideals of unity , solidarity and harmony among the peoples of europe ,.
",
7514,0,," the high representative will not only act as a spokesman for eu nations when they agree on foreign policies , but will act as a catalyst around which external policy will increasingly become coordinated .
",
7515,0,," by chairing meetings of eu foreign ministers , he or she will be able to shape the agenda and influence the outcomes of meetings , encouraging member states increasingly to think in terms of common foreign policy positions .
",
7516,0,," they will have added authority from their ability to speak for the eu in the un security council .
",
7517,0,," the high representative will also direct the eu 's new external action service , which brings together policy specialists from both the council and commission in a unique manner , ranging from the arctic region to nuclear safety and enlargement ,.
",
7518,0,," with representatives all over the world the eu will develop a foreign service capable of creating and articulating policy positions in a manner that few national governments can match .
",
7519,0,," over time this will promote the evolution of a true eu foreign and security policy , and will contribute significantly to increased european consciousness among eu citizens and further moves to political unity .
",
7520,1,,"isolationism is a form of foreign policy in which a state seeks to avoid all international entanglements, including political alliances, commitments, organizations, and trade agreements.
",
7521,1,," there are usually two parts to such a policy.
",
7522,1,," first is non-interventionism, meaning the state will not involve itself in international military alliances and will not engage in conflict except to protect its own vital interests.
",
7523,1,," second is protectionism, wherein the state sets up legal barriers to trade and to cultural exchange.
",
7524,1,," the united states held to a policy of isolationism for most of its history ending permanently only in the 20th century with the second world war and subsequent cold war.
",
7525,1,," a number of american politicians, scholars, and a growing number of concerned citizens have begun to advocate a return to isolationism.
",
7526,1,," they cite the risks and costs of american involvement on the world stage and decry its position as de facto world police, which they see as not only an expensive endeavor, but also dangerous to the security of the state.
",
7527,1,," they also argue that the dangers of its trade deficit brought on by a lack of trade barriers create the risk of the united states becoming the economic thrall of its creditors.
",
7528,1,," opponents of such views point out that the decades since the united states has become the primary actor on the world stage have been marked by an unprecedented degree of stability and prosperity across the globe, and that its withdrawal from world affairs might create dangerous disorder.
",
7529,1,," they also cite the fact that the american economy, dependent on free trade, would contract and its people's standard of living would diminish should it pursue a policy of isolationism.
",
7530,0,," debates on this issue revolve around the issues of whether the united states has a moral right to withdraw from the international system, whether such withdrawal would be overly harmful to world security and stability, and whether it would be inordinately harmful to the united states' own society.
",
7531,0,,"the foreign policy of the united states was first conceived as being one of strict isolationism .
",
7532,0,," since the time of george washington , who warned against the risks of entangling alliances with foreign powers , american foreign policy has been based squarely in the principles of non-interventionism1 .
",
7533,0,," by pursuing this course the united states was able to avoid involvement in the ruinous wars of europe that wracked that continent during the 18th and 19th centuries , sapping their strength and ultimately bringing about the downfalls of their far-flung empires .
",
7534,0,," during those same years the united states was able to focus on its own growth , fighting only when its own vital interests were at stake , and pushed its borders from being just a small nation on the eastern coast of the north american continent to the point whereby it was a continent-spanning giant1 .
",
7535,0,," it was only during world war one that the united states broke with its long tradition of non-entanglement with foreign powers , and its involvement in that conflict led it to be embroiled in the foreign intrigues and power games that made the 20th and early 21st centuries ones of almost constant american involvement in wars ; wars that were always in far-flung locales in which the united states ' vital interests did not truly lie .
",
7536,0,," in order to escape the entanglements of the international system , the united states must seek to disengage itself and to pursue once again a policy of concern for its own interests without concern for the happenings of other states .

",
7545,0,," popular opinion in the united states has been shifting more and more toward preference for non-interventionist and isolationist foreign policy .
",
7546,0,," people in the united states are tired of the costs of foreign adventures , in both lives and wealth , and have been clamoring as of late for a return to a more traditional foreign policy .
",
7547,0,," this is amply demonstrated in the rise of the tea party movement and its success in thecongressional election1 .
",
7548,0,," the tea party has been fighting for a less intrusive , smaller government , and demand that state spending be reined in and the massive deficit dealt with .
",
7549,0,," there is no better way to accomplish this aim than reducing american involvement in foreign conflicts and in its large military presence around the world2 .
",
7550,0,," by pursuing a policy of non-interventionism , the united states will be able to bring its finances back in order by not spending so heavily on defense , while also allowing domestic production to increase through protectionism of domestic business .
",
7551,0,," the united states has at its disposal the most powerful military in history , and is comparatively more powerful than any single state has been in history .
",
7552,0,," yet its forces are stretched thin across the globe and embroiled in ongoing conflicts in several regions , particularly its seemingly endless wars in the middle east1 .
",
7553,0,," the cost of such military output and the number of soldiers stationed on overmilitary bases around the world is unsustainable .
",
7554,0,," the united states must focus its defense policy on the protection of its own borders and its own people rather than getting involved with the problems of other states as it has done in recent years .
",
7555,0,," behaving as the world 's police has served to provide many countries with the public good of international security , allowing them to scale back their own military spending and letting the united states pick up the slack .
",
7556,0,," yet its behavior has not earned it approbation , but rather the ire of many parts of the international community , as well as that of terrorist groups who see the united states as an imperialist oppressor .
",
7557,0,," the growing economic cost of this international security provision , along with the domestic security threats created by it create the risk that the united states could collapse under the pressure , as so many powerful states have done in the past ; just as rome fell due to its stretching its resources too thin , so too might the united states2 .
",
7558,0,," by pursuing a policy of isolationism , the united states can spend less while providing superior security for its own citizens .
",
7559,0,," its technological and military superiority will not be affected by such a move , but will rather simply be more efficiently utilized .
",
7560,0,," with a military dedicated to the protection of the united states and its narrow national interests , it can project power around the world without the huge costs of the current system .
",
7561,0,," the united states has spent the last several decades trying to promote its ideals around the world by , among other things , offering support to fledgling democracies and democratic movements , staging humanitarian interventions to end tyranny and oppression , and offering extensive foreign aid packages to weaker economies struggling to develop .
",
7562,0,," all of these activities have put the united states into a state of almost constant conflict .
",
7563,0,," its interventions in korea , vietnam , kosovo , iraq , afghanistan , and others have proven costly in both blood and treasure1 .
",
7564,0,," for all its efforts , the united states has gained little in terms of material benefits for its own people .
",
7565,0,," yet the first duty of a state is to its own people .
",
7566,0,," by adopting a position of isolationism , the united states can place its focus on protecting its own people .
",
7567,0,," instead of getting caught up in entangling alliances that lead to unnecessary foreign wars , the united states can follow a path of peace and self-sufficiency that will allow its people to be free of the costs and horrors of war and international intrigue2 .
",
7568,0,," on the level of principle , it is the duty of the united states government to be isolationist , because only in that way can it fulfill its true duty which is to maintaining the safety of its people .
",
7569,0,," the united states has become economically dependent upon the productive capacities of other states , leaving it vulnerable to their influence and machinations .
",
7570,0,," its reliance upon china to produce much of its consumer goods and upon the middle east for oil , have resulted in a major trade imbalance that is only growing .
",
7571,0,," the trade deficit was $ 50.2 billion in maywith china alone making up $billion of this1 .
",
7572,0,," eventually china , and , other net exporters to the united states will be able to pull its economic strings , and thus dominate it politically .
",
7573,0,," for the united states to retain its political and economic autonomy , it must rein in its overactive spending as well as its borrowing from abroad .
",
7574,0,," the only way to accomplish this is through a policy promoting domestic self-sufficiency by means of raising trade barriers with states and firms abroad .
",
7575,0,," through a regime of protective tariffs and forced trade balancing , the united states can expand domestic industries and rebuild those that have atrophied due to foreign competition .
",
7576,0,," it is through such policies that it can restore itself to the position of a net exporter and escape the economic invasion of foreign powers2 .
",
7577,0,," the result of an isolationist policy for the economy will be a more self-sufficient nation with domestic industries capable of providing for the needs of its citizens , and one not dependent on any other state for vital commodities .
",
7578,0,," the united states is particularly well suited to such an enterprise due to its immense size and wealth in resources and human capital .
",
7579,0,," there is no need for such damaging economic relations as it has pursued , as allowing itself to be tied into the international economic system only exposes it to the machinations of unfriendly foreign powers and also makes it susceptible to contagion effects of economic crises in international markets .
",
7580,0,," clearly , the wise path is for america to protect its own economic interests through protectionism and isolationism .
",
7581,1,,"the first quarter ofsaw a remarkable wave of protests sweep across the arab world.
",
7582,1,," on january 14th, president zine el abidine ben ali of tunisia who had ruled sincefled following days of protest.
",
7583,1,," this success for people power was unprecedented in the arab world where previous regime changes have been coups lead by members of a narrow elite or the military.
",
7584,1,," the tunisian success emboldened opponents of other regimes across the arab world.
",
7585,1,," there was a wave of protests in bahrain, jordan, yemen and most significantly egypt.
",
7586,1,," the king of jordan dismissed his government on february 1st.
",
7587,1,," this was followed by the rather more significant resignation of egyptian president hosni mubarak on february 11th following weeks of protest.
",
7588,1,," the protests continued to spread around the arab world.
",
7589,1,," protests in eastern libya resulted in a still ongoing civil war.
",
7590,1,," something of a counter revolution gathered pace with the protests in bahrain being crushed by saudi outside intervention.
",
7591,1,," on april 23rd president ali abdullah saleh of yemen agreed to step down but continued to soldier on for another couple of months.
",
7592,1,," by october of 2011, the conflict in libya had ended with the death of muammar gaddafi.
",
7593,1,," as tunisia, egypt, and libya undergo their first legitimate national elections in decades, syria and yemen face uncertatinty as violence continues and the goal line appears more and more distant.
",
7594,0,," many middle eastern states already have institutions that are similar to the representative institutions that a stable democracy needs so can easily become the real thing .
",
7595,0,," arab dictators have grown adept at holding elections , setting up parliaments ; constitutional courts etc. as window dressing to show either to their people or to the outside world that they are reforming and are ` democratic ' .
",
7596,0,," no matter how undemocratic these regimes have been the simple existence of these institutions is useful when there is a revolution as they allow some continuity and the possibility of a transition to democracy .
",
7597,0,," to take egypt where protests toppled the mubarak regime as an example .
",
7598,0,," it has a parliament with the majilis al-sha ' ab , people 's assembly , as its lower house and majilis al-shura , shura council , as its upper house .
",
7599,0,," in both houses a majority of the members are directly elected .
",
7600,0,," egypt held elections for its parliament as recently as november, these elections had very poor turnout and blatant ballot rigging while the main opposition the muslim brotherhood have to stand as independents .
",
7601,0,," egypt also has previously had local elections for 52,000 municipal council seats in some 4,500 towns and cities .
",
7602,0,," these elections are just as fraudulent as those for the national parliament .
",
7603,0,," according to muslim brotherhood mp jamdi hassan `` the ruling party used to allow opposition candidates to run and then simply rig the elections .
",
7604,0,," now , it has adopted a new strategy to ensure its continued domination : preventing the opposition from fielding any candidates at all . ''
",
7605,0,," this may not be the best democratic tradition but at least it is a start .
",
7606,0,," similarly egypt has a supreme constitutional court that is supposed to be independent .
",
7607,0,," while these institutions may have ceased working in a democratic way they could quite easily be changed in to being fully democratic .
",
7608,0,," this would create the necessary checks and balances to sustain democracy over the long term .
",
7609,0,," the people are used to elections and will know what to do when they have the option to vote freely , they would vote in a broad range of candidates .
",
7610,0,," many of them may be islamist but it would be democratic .
",
7611,0,," egypt as the biggest arab state and one of only two so far that have had largely peaceful revolutions is perhaps the best example of the progress that has been made .
",
7612,0,," there was a referendum in egypt in march on amending the constitution that passed with a yes vote of 77.2 % .
",
7613,0,," that there was a referendum at all surely counts as progress .
",
7614,0,," it limits the number of presidential terms to two , promises to strengthen the judiciary and abolish some of the emergency laws .
",
7615,0,," a turnout of% is not as good as it could have been but it was a great advance compared to other polls in recent egyptian history .
",
7616,0,," mohamed ahmed attia , the chairman of the supreme judicial committee that supervised the elections , explained its significance as being `` the first real referendum in egypt 's history , we had an unprecedented turnout because after jan.people started to feel that their vote would matter . ''
",
7617,0,," because egypt has historically been at the center of the arab world success in egypt will be vital to show that a stable arab democracy can be created .
",
7618,0,," the economic , social , and political history of the region show there are many obstacles to establishing stable democracies in the middle east .
",
7619,0,," many in the west fear that islam is among these barriers , with claims that islamist parties like the muslim brotherhood in egypt and ennahda in tunisia will turn their countries into theocracies like iran .
",
7620,0,," however , there are majority-muslim states with islamist parties that have succeeded in creating stable democracies , including turkey and indonesia .
",
7621,0,," both countries are good case studies that disprove the widespread notion that islam is incompatible with democracy .
",
7622,0,," turkey is most often cited as a good example for the arab spring to follow .
",
7623,0,," the election of the akp has shown that an islamic party can also uphold democracy , so providing a good example for the powerful muslim brotherhood in the arab world .
",
7624,0,," elections are free and fair and the press is relatively free .
",
7625,0,," the prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has faced down coup threats from the military , again something that may well be necessary given the large role the military has had in the previous regimes .
",
7626,0,," turkey 's economy is growing briskly and turkey is following a foreign policy of reaching out to everybody and is touting itself as a model for arab countries to follow .
",
7627,0,," in indonesia inthere was a revolution that ousted president suharto who had like mubarak been in power for thirty years .
",
7628,0,," this revolution progressed in a very similar way to the ongoing revolution in egypt -- in both countries the protesters were middle class and young , the president went relatively peacefully and the military helped during the transition .
",
7629,0,," indonesia is now the largest muslim democracy in the world and while there are islamist parties in parliament their support is now below% .
",
7630,0,," indonesia can therefore provide a road map for moving from an interim government with the military in control to a fully functioning and successful democracy .
",
7631,1,,"nafta- north american free trade agreement- was implemented inby canada, the united states, and mexico.
",
7632,1,," the agreement eliminated tariffs and quantity restrictions for imports and exports between the three countries1.
",
7633,1,," almost twenty years later, the success of nafta is hotly debated.
",
7634,1,," while trade between the three countries has increased, particular industries in each nation have been hurt by shifts in production.
",
7635,1,," the debate focuses largely on mexico and the united states, where it is unclear whether the benefits of cheaper products have outweighed job replacement.
",
7636,1,," in this debate, it is important to consider that there are many economic indicators that may claim to evaluate the success of nafta- income inequality, unemployment, gdp growth, trade deficits, etc. furthermore, nafta does not exist in a bubble- north america has been heavily influenced by social changes, technological advances, cross-continental relations, and many other factors which may influence the economy.
",
7637,0,," therefore, debaters should hesitate to assume particular changes are the direct result of nafta.
",
7638,0,,"canada already benefited from having the world 's biggest market next door and under nafta this benefit is expanded immensely .
",
7639,0,," under nafta , betweenand, canada 's economy grew at 3.6 % annually , and employment has risen1 .
",
7640,0,," nafta has also help equalize agricultural flows between the us and canada .
",

7663,1,,"the united states congress passed the ""secure fence act of 2006"" which authorized the creation of several separation barriers at the mexican-american border and the installation of a virtual fence consisting of surveillance cameras, sensors, and other equipment to cover those parts of the border that do not have a physical wall.
",
7664,0,," the debate is highly related to the american debate on immigration, and controversies about the fence center on its efficacy, costs, symbolic value, and more.
",
7665,0,,"a fence would help defend the economy of the united states during difficult times by protecting american jobs .
",
7666,0,," it is a popular misconception that immigrants only do the types of jobs that native-born americans will not take .
",
7667,0,," many professions encompassing construction , grounds-maintenance , housekeeping , and janitorial services actually have the majority of jobs performed by native-born americans .1 furthermore , illegal immigrants constitute a tremendous drain on various public benefits .
",
7668,0,," these include medical treatment , because no one who is seriously injured or sick can be turned away from the emergency room as a result of a law called emtala  municipal services like fire and police protection , food stamps , and education in public schools .

",
7676,0,," it is clear that the fence is wildly popular -- well over half of the united states supports it3 , and many individuals are so adamant about increasing border security that they are willing to make donations for these purposes4 .
",
7677,0,," the social contract of the united states means that the government is democratically elected and therefore accountable to its people .
",
7678,0,," if they want to focus on securing the borders instead of providing more extensive welfare programs or reforming education or anything else they could be spending money on , that is their prerogative .
",
7679,0,," mexican violence between drug cartels frequently spills over and threatens the lives and peace-of-mind of americans as well .
",
7680,0,," the council on foreign relations has said that mexico 's levels of violence and lawlessness over the past few years exceed even those in iraq or afghanistan .1 that has forced a costly increased police presence in border areas , and even that often proves insufficient to quell the killings .
",
7681,0,," but even if the violent common criminals were somehow suppressed because of stepped up actions by the mexican government , an easily penetrated border presents a national security threat .

",
7695,1,,"the security council is the key organ of the united nations with primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.
",
7696,1,," it has the power to establish peacekeeping missions, impose international sanctions, and can authorise military action against a sovereign state.
",
7697,1,," currently it consist of fifteen members, five of them (uk, usa, france, russia and china) are permanent members that hold a special veto power over all non-procedural decisions in the council.
",
7698,1,," the other ten are elected for two-year terms.
",
7699,1,," directly after world warthe security council had eleven members; after the amendment of the un charter inthe number of non-permanent members was increased from six to ten but no other substantial changes were made.
",
7700,1,," since the first reform in the sixties no other reforms have been made, although the world today has changed drastically from the world just after second world war.
",
7701,1,,"the question of equitable representation in the security council has been on the general assembly agenda since 1979, when a number of mostly developing countries raised the issue of under-representation of developing and non-aligned countries in the security council.
",
7702,1,," although the topic of the reform of the security council was opened already in the late seventies there was no extensive debate until the 1990s.
",
7703,1,," the 1980s were still an era marked by antagonism between east and west and due to the large economic problems of developing countries their influence and that of the non-aligned movement decreased.
",
7704,1,," at that time there was no general support for major reform, since all the permanent members, except for china, opposed any expansion vigorously.
",
7705,1,,"while the 1980s were perhaps still an inconvenient time for the discussion, the atmosphere dramatically changed in the nineties.
",
7706,1,," the security council has become much more active after the end of the cold war and has therefore attracted more attention and consequently also criticism.
",
7707,1,," today it seems to be universally acknowledged that some sort of reform is needed and urgent but there is no consensus on what this reform should look like.
",
7708,1,," there are several models debated, some of them propose expansion only in the non-permanent category, others a third category of members that would have longer terms but no veto power.
",
7709,1,," the most supported models envisage increases in both the permanent and non-permanent categories.
",
7710,1,," one of them is the so-called razali proposal that addspermanent (germany, japan, one from africa, one from asia, one from latin america) andnon-permanent seats (one for asia, latin america, africa and eastern europe) to the existing council, increasing the total number of members to 24.
",
7711,1,," this proposal enjoys the widest support, yet it has not gained the sufficient number of votes required by the un charter (two-thirds of un members, including all five permanent members are needed for any charter amendments).
",
7712,1,," the arguments below discuss the pros and cons of a plan to expand membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories.
",
7713,1,,"furthermore due to the increased activity of the eu in foreign policy areas, the question has arisen, triggering new debates, whether the eu should get a permanent seat on the unsc, replacing france and the uk who would lose their permanent seats.
",
7714,0,," the possible changes in the un security council and the eventual consequences of them are object of the current debate.
",
7715,0,,"the current security council does n't reflect the economic reality of the 21st century .
",
7716,0,," france and great britain have clearly lost their position among the most powerful nations and their role was long ago taken over by germany and japan .
",
7717,0,," they are the 3rd and 4th world economies .
",
7718,0,," furthermore these two countries are the second and third largest contributors to the un budget and deserve a permanent seat in the council .
",
7719,0,," moreover , as permanent members pay an extra share for their seat , japan and germany 's contributions would bring considerable amounts to the un budget -- `` the three largest contributors to the united nations , the us , 22.000 % of the un budget , japan , 12.530 % , and germany , 8.018 % , thus together finance some% of the entire un budget . ''
",
7720,0,,"  meanwhile brazil and india have emerged as major economies and stable democracies over the past decade , and deserve recognition for their global importance .
",
7721,0,," at the moment many countries are not heard in the council and some states may never gain a chance of being elected to the security council .
",
7722,0,," this leaves billions of the world 's population without representation in the world 's highest body .
",
7723,0,," how can india with over a sixth of the world 's population be left out ?
",
7724,0,," security council expansion would make the un much more democratic as there would be more participants representing more of the people of the world present in closed meetings and informal consultations .
",
7725,0,," expansion would increase the transparency and therefore the accountability of the council -- something that even countries sometimes considered to be against democracy believe is necessary `` he , seyed mohammad ali mottaghi nejad , said iran believed that the links between the issues comprised the `` basic objective '' of a comprehensive reform towards a council that was more democratic , inclusive , equitably representative , transparent , effective and accountable .
",
7726,0,," ``  inthere were onlyun members , so eleven council members were adequately representing all voices .
",
7727,0,," today the un membership has risen to almost four times the number of the original one , yet there are only fifteen voices in the council .
",
7728,0,," this means that there are many countries who do not have anyone on the security council that has similar priorities to them , their views may well be unrepresented .
",
7729,0,," there is a growing imbalance between developing and developed countries representation in the council .
",
7730,0,," four out of five permanent members are industrialized and four out of five are `` european '' .
",
7731,0,," the four-fifths of humankind that live in developing countries have only one spokesman among the permanent five .
",
7732,0,," giving africa , asia and latin america a permanent seat is a step forward in north-south balance -- `` currently , four out of five veto-bearing members are industrialized countries and the fifth , china , is rapidly approaching industrialized status .
",
7733,0,," many in the rest of the world seethe at their exclusion from this elite group .
",
7734,0,," africa , latin america , and the islamic world , for example , have no permanent voice on the council .
",
7735,0,," without a voice , it is understandable why many countries are unwilling to send troops or aid whenever the security council demands it .
",
7736,0,," this imbalance , highlighted by the iraq war , has made security council reform a hot topic of debate . ''
",
7737,0,,"  the eu is one of the world 's largest trade blocs , has the world 's largest gdp , and represents almost half a billion people .
",
7738,0,," a permanent seat for the eu would reflect those new power dimensions .
",
7739,0,," the permanent seats for france and the uk are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of world war ii .
",
7740,0,," however , the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then : france and the uk have declined and at the same time , the eu has emerged as a major player in the international arena .
",
7741,1,,"on the 30th june 2012, egypt welcomed its first democratically elected government and first elected president; mohamed morsi.
",
7742,1,," their election was the result of months of protest against the previous president hosni mubarak, who had ruled over the country for the past thirty years.
",
7743,1,," there was a great sense of optimism in both the domestic and international community for the first democratically elected president and parliament.
",
7744,1,," it was expected that they would reverse the economic and democratic injustice which egypt had suffered in recent years.
",
7745,1,," this was not to be the case, however.
",
7746,1,," several policies and actions taken by morsi were poorly received by many in egypt.
",
7747,1,," when mohamed morsi announced in novemberthat he was enacting a declaration which made him immune from judicial interference.
",
7748,1,," this was perceived by many to be a return to dictatorship, which led to widespread protests.
",
7749,1,," both anti and pro morsi supporters took to the street and the egyptian army gave the presidenthours to resolve the crisis.
",
7750,1,," when morsi failed to do so, he was ousted from power on the 3rd july 2013.
",
7751,1,," an interim government was put in place with the support of the army.
",
7752,1,,"this action received a mixed response, some welcomed it stating that morsi was undermining democratic institutions.
",
7753,1,," others were less enthusiastic, however, pointing to morsi’s elected position and the authoritarian way in which the army acted.
",
7754,0,,"  separation of powers is a key democratic principle which morsi undermined with the novemberdeclaration .
",
7755,0,," the underlying idea of the separation of powers is that one branch of government should not have undue power over any other .
",
7756,0,," that is why there are a number of checks and balances set out which allows each branch to constrain the actions of the others to prevent them acting illegally .
",
7757,0,," morsi 's declaration that he would remove the checks and balances which the judiciary held over the presidency violated this principle .
",
7758,0,," this led many to fear that morsi was returning the country to a dictatorship where he could force through the muslim brotherhood 's agenda , undoing the work of the arab spring .
",
7759,0,," the army 's intercession was welcomed by many as maintaining democracy .
",
7760,0,," the official line of argument for the egyptian army 's intervention was that morsi 's administration was failing to grasp control of a worsening situation .
",
7761,0,," the response to morsi 's judicial immunity had been largely negative , with tens of thousands taking to the streets to protest .
",
7762,0,," soon after , pro-morsi protestors began their own protests .
",
7763,0,," muslim brotherhood supporters were called to defend the palace and the resulting clashes left ten dead .
",
7764,0,," on the 1st julymillions of protestors gathered in tahrir square , as well as in alexandria , port said and suez and the egyptian army stated it would intervene if the government did not ` meet the demands of the people ' by restructuring the government to appease protestors .
",
7765,0,," the protestors did not disperse , and there were several ministers who resigned from government .
",
7766,0,," with no clear policy change in sight , morsi had evidently failed to take control of the situation .
",
7767,0,," general el-sisi , leader of the coup , claimed that they ` could not stay silent and blind to the call of the egyptian masses ' .
",
7768,0,," the intervention was necessary as egypt had become ungovernable .
",
7769,0,," morsi 's inability to tackle the main issues which faced egypt was another issue which caused the large-scale protests leading to his removal .
",
7770,0,," one of the major reasons for egypt 's lotus revolution was the lack of economic reform .
",
7771,0,," rising living costs , unemployment and wage levels were causes of grievance for the majority of egyptians .
",
7772,0,," the egyptian population hoped that , once the corruption of the mubarak regime was replaced by a democratic system , their economic condition would improve .
",
7773,0,," this was not to be the case .
",
7774,0,," the morsi government planned to reduce its fuel subsidies to entitle the country to a $ 4.8 billion loan from the international monetary fund , raising the living costs of the average citizens .
",
7775,0,," in conjunction with the subsidy cuts , the government failed to tackle unemployment .
",
7776,0,," at the time of morsi 's ouster from government there were 3.6 million unemployed , an increase of one million since.
",
7777,0,," analysts linked the lack of jobs to the security of the state claiming that unemployment would lead to greater numbers of rioters and furthering instability .
",
7778,0,," in a poll assessing the egyptians ' attitude toward their government and their future ,% felt they were worse off than five years ago .
",
7779,0,," this dissatisfaction then led to dissent .
",
7780,0,," another major concern of the anti-morsi protestors on whose behalf the egyptian army intervened was the islamist nature of morsi .
",
7781,0,," while many supported the islamic nature of the muslim brotherhood , there were equally many liberals and coptic christians who were afraid of egypt transforming in to an islamic state .
",
7782,0,," mubarak had managed to secure popularity within these groups by exploiting this fear that , should his regime be overthrown , extreme islamists such as the muslim brotherhood would take control and deprive them of their rights .
",
7783,0,," the morsi government 's constitution was thus perceived as a threat to minority and secular rights , and thus a security issue .
",
7784,0,," even if this was not the case , morsi should have done more to calm the population 's fear rather than allowing discord to materialise .
",
7785,1,,"a fundamental point within acemoglu and robinson’s (2013) why nations fail is that the prosperity of a nation relies upon an effective power structure.
",
7786,1,," political institutions need to be democratic, reasonably centralised, accountable, and inclusive, for prosperity to be found and sustained - much of which is not found within african nation-states.
",
7787,1,," good governance is fundamental for the developmental prosperity of nations.
",
7788,1,,"the mo ibrahim prize was first established in 2007, and the prize represents a celebration of excellent african leadership.
",
7789,1,," the prize is awarded to a former head of state, or government, for their positive work in enabling the prosperity of their nation, tackling poverty, and sustaining an equitable path of development.
",
7790,1,," the former head of state or government has to have left office within the last three years, have been democratically elected and completed their term, and shown ‘exceptional’ leadership.
",
7791,1,," the prize has two crucial features: celebrating political governance in africa and identifying role models within the continent.
",
7792,1,," the prize includes $5mn over ten years and then $200,000 per year for life - the largest annual fund.
",
7793,1,," previous winners include president nelson mandela (honorary) and joaquim chassano (2007); president festus mogae (2008), and president pedro pires (2011) (mo ibrahim foundation, 2013).
",
7794,1,," however, with the prize criteria regularly not being fulfilled, since its establishment inthe prize has remained unclaimed foryears - 2009, 2012, and recently 2013.
",
7795,1,," to what extent can the denial of the prize be justified?
",
7796,0,," does it act to incentivise african leaders to follow good governance?
",
7797,0,,"the past few years have seen african governments , and heads of state , reluctant to leave office ; driving political coups ; and leading violent crimes against humanity .
",
7798,0,," mugabe , kabila , and kenyatta are but a few articulating the years of sustained bad governance .
",
7799,0,," the prize is only awarded when credit is due - if leaders have made a significant positive impact this will be recognised and rewarded .
",
7800,0,," the prize is therefore for absolute gains in governance , not relative to other countries .
",
7801,0,," as the prize is not always awarded it avoids the pitfall that distributing a financial prize where no change has been made to political institutions would reinforce a system .
",
7802,0,," the state would continue to function on undemocratic governance , and the reward would become a new example of dead money .
",
7803,0,," instead it encourages improved control over aid and money transferred to african states , it shows that rewards are given based on merit .
",
7804,0,," the mo ibrahim prize therefore encourages the good institutions that are necessary for prosperity , acemoglu and robinson  .
",
7805,0,," previous winners - such as nelson mandela and pedro pires - made significant changes to their nation-states , ending apartheid and promoting social development .
",
7806,0,," the former leaders provided equality and a functioning democracy to their people .
",
7807,0,," such needs to be the aim of leaders today .
",
7808,0,," providing a prize to the highest achievers provides an example .
",
7809,0,," it highlights leaders from even small countries -- such as cape verde 's pires -- that can serve as role models for africa 's leaders .
",
7810,0,," without the prize the most likely role models would simply be those of the biggest states who are highest profile .
",
7811,0,," mo ibrahim  has stated the prize is for `` excellence , it 's not a pension '' .
",
7812,0,," this is why it is not always awarded .
",
7813,0,," the prize is only be awarded when high-standards of good governance are replicated , and maintained , by leaders .
",
7814,0,," focusing on the top of government encourages a top down implementation of good government .
",
7815,0,," when the leader acts others will follow ; a comparatively small amount of money can therefore make a big difference .
",
7816,0,," the prize is helping citizens to be aware of good governance , and bad , occurring within their state .
",
7817,0,," by granting the prize citizens are shown what leaders have done right ; and the publication of the index - the ibrahim index of african governance , iiag , - shows where improvement may be required .
",
7818,0,," the prize is forcing transparency between governments and society .
",
7819,0,," information on how states are doing means citizens can take action , and demand change where change is needed .
",
7820,0,," the prize is calling for african citizens to get the leadership they deserved , desired , and have a right to .
",
7821,0,," by maintaining strict standards on when , and to whom , the reward is provided gives a realistic picture of governance in africa .
",
7822,0,," it showcases the continued need for good governance ; and also does n't give citizens and the international community a false illusion that governance is good in africa when it is not .
",
7823,1,,"eritrea is a small nation state on the coast of the red sea with a history of past struggles.
",
7824,1,," a former colony of italy, its annexation by ethiopia via the united nations general assembly resolutionfollowing the second world war led to a thirty year armed struggle for independence.
",
7825,1,," this movement allied itself with the ethiopian people’s revolutionary democratic front and eventually gained independence once the combined forces overthrew ethiopia’s marxist government in 19912.
",
7826,1,," two years later it was finally recognised as a member of the united nations (un).
",
7827,1,,"despite initially positive relations, eritrean-ethiopian relations soon deteriorated over the ethiopian occupation of badme, which was traditionally eritrean land as declared by the boundaries commision in 20023.
",
7828,1,," ethiopia claimed the land for itself and had occupied the town and other ‘eritrean’ areas.
",
7829,1,," prior to this, the border had not been an issue for the unified forces as it was merely an arbitrary line between the two states.
",
7830,1,," eritrea eventually forced ethiopian troops out of badme, leading to the eritrean-ethiopian war.
",
7831,1,," the 1998-2000 border war failed to completely resolve the issue.
",
7832,1,," the war was symptomatic of decreasing international co-operation between eritrea and the rest of the world.
",
7833,0,," this examines whether eritrea or other actors are responsible for the state’s isolation.1) united nations general assembly, ‘resolution(v) eritrea’december 19502) cousin,t. ‘eritrean and ethiopian civil war’, november 19973) lauterpacht,e. ‘sixteenth report on the work of the commission’february 2005eritrea was responsible for instigating the war against ethiopia , making it liable for its increased isolation .
",
7834,0,," eritrea was officially recognised by an international claims commission as the initiator of the war1 .
",
7835,0,," the state invaded the region of badme after a long diplomatic dispute over the border issue as they believed the territory was rightfully theirs2 .
",
7836,0,," they removed the ethiopian presence from the state , compromising territorial integrity and incurred a reaction from ethiopia .
",
7837,0,," this marked eritrea as the aggressor .
",
7838,0,," an aggressor in a war can not be seen as a ` just ' actor and has therefore contributed to its own seclusion by acting in such a manner .
",
7839,0,," 1 , bbc , ` eritrea broke law in border war ' ,december2 , briggs , p. ` ethiopia ' pg .30 accusations have been made against eritrea claiming that they have supported terrorist groups , particularly those operating in neighbouring countries .
",
7840,0,," eritrea has been accused of supporting al-shabaab , an al-qaeda affiliated terrorist group in somalia who also operate in kenya , as well as several other secessionist groups .
",
7841,0,," training camps have reportedly been established within eritrea , several of which were attacked by ethiopia in.
",
7842,0,," the attempts to destabilise east africa have naturally led to international condemnation , especially from the usa whose `` war on terror '' was contradicted by eritrea 's action2 .
",
7843,0,," this would suggest that eritrea 's own actions are responsible for their isolation .

",

",

",
7851,0,," afewerki claims that as aid decreases , farmers will work harder to ensure that food demand is met .
",
7852,0,," the lack of donors and trading partners has served to weaken eritrea 's ties of the outside world , making the state responsible for its own isolation .

",
7854,1,,"africa has been plagued by conflict in the second half of the 20th century and the start of the 21st.
",
7855,1,," 65% of states in sub-saharan africa have experienced an armed conflict since independence with the number of conflicts rising from only one into a height of eighteen inbefore falling back to single figures.
",
7856,1,," this may be exaggerated as the data set counts conflicts as where there werebattle deaths in a year – a very low threshold.
",
7857,1,," but while some of these conflicts may have been very small, africa has also had its share of the most horrific conflicts since the second world war, most notably the congolese civil war which up tohad caused an estimated 3.5million deaths, and the rwandan genocide (not always considered a conflict) that may well have killed up to 800,000 people.
",
7858,1,,"despite (or perhaps because of) this history, the 50th anniversary solemn declaration by the african union (au) indeclared “we pledge not to bequeath the burden of conflicts to the next generation of africans and undertake to end all wars in africa by 2020”.
",
7859,1,," ending all wars is a high minded principle and a desire to do so is regularly espoused by politicians but is it actually achievable in africa – and by the ambitious date of 2020?
",
7860,0,," the solemn declaration did not just highlight the goal but also that it would be achieved through three techniques : by, addressing the causes of conflicts -- economic and social disparities , strengthening judicial systems to ensure accountability , and reaffirming collective responsibility  preventing emerging sources of conflict such as piracy getting a foothold , and, engaging in conflict prevention .
",
7861,0,," africa has been building the african peace and security architecture to address these causes of conflict .
",
7862,0,," it has created the peace and security council that facilitates the au 's response to crises ; it can engage in actions from humanitarian assistance to military intervention if there are particularly grave circumstances such as genocide .
",
7863,0,," when it does authorise action , this action is coordinated by the au commission .
",
7864,0,," when it comes to peaceful resolution of conflict , the au has a ` panel of the wise ' made up of former presidents and others with lots of influence and moral authority who use preventative diplomacy to try to resolve conflicts .
",
7865,0,," conflict in africa is slowly being ended .
",
7866,0,," inthere wereconflicts in africa ; bythis had been halved to.
",
7867,0,," but a decline in the number of conflicts is not the only positive trend in african conflicts : there has also been a decline in the size of wars .
",
7868,0,," they have changed from wars between two organised armies to being small scale insurgencies .
",
7869,0,," inthe conflicts were on average causing more than 20,000 battle deaths per year , but byonly around 1,000 .
",
7870,0,," even the number of incidents of genocide and mass killing has been going down fromin the 1980s to five in the 2000s .
",
7871,0,," ending war might therefore be considered to be ambitious but it is not against the trend and not inconceivable .
",
7872,0,," the african union has been taking a much more active stance in preventing and resolving conflict .
",
7873,0,," sinceresponsibility for peace in africa has been with the peace and security council .
",
7874,0,," this body has authorised au interventions in somalia , sudan , burundi , and the central african republic .
",
7875,0,," the african union is not the only organisation engaged in peacekeeping ; the economic community of west african states , ecowas , has also been actively engaged in peacekeeping , having been deployed in numerous conflicts since the 1990s , most recently in mali where they took part alongside french forces in defeating an islamist insurgency .
",
7876,0,," the au is also boosting its collective capacity to respond to crises creating the african standby force made up of five regional brigades ofsoldiers .
",
7877,0,," this force , when complete , will enable rapid deployment anywhere in africa so helping to prevent crises becoming full scale wars .
",
7878,0,," what is war ?
",
7879,0,," the au 's declaration does not define it .
",
7880,0,," ending all conflict is ambitious , ending only inter state war in africa on the other hand is not .
",
7881,0,," the vast majority of conflicts in africa have been internal .
",
7882,0,," the only true inter state conflicts have been the wars between israel and egypt , the eritrean-ethiopian war , the uganda-tunisia war , and the second congo war .
",
7883,0,," none of these are ongoing .
",
7884,0,," the only conflicts that might count as inter-state that might be considered ongoing are the situation in western sahara and border clashes between the sudans .
",
7885,0,," western sahara might be considered to be frozen with very few deaths as a result of it and the sudan conflict is in large part a result of the border being new .
",
7886,1,,"france sentsoldiers, a rapid increase from an initial 550, backed by helicopter gunships and fighter jets to the west african country of mali.
",
7887,1,," the troops weee being sent both to secure the capital, bamako, and to the front lines in a fight against islamists who have overrun azawad, the northern half of mali.
",
7888,1,,"the end of the conflict in libya inwith the overthrow of muammar gaddafi both meant a large number of militants who had been fighting for the libyan dictator fleeing south and a large influx of weaponry into north africa.
",
7889,1,," some of this weaponry found its way to the tuareg tribes of northern mali some of whom under the banner of national movement for azawad have fought for the establishment of a tuareg state first upon independence inand more recently in the early 1990s.
",
7890,1,," these weapons provided the opportunity for a renewed bid by a successor organisation the national movement for the liberation of azawad (mnla).
",
7891,1,," attacks started on towns in the far north east of the country in the middle of january 2012, by the middle of march the rebels were closing in on timbuktu.
",
7892,1,,"a coup on 21st march toppled the malian president touré with captain amadou sanogo, its leader, citing the poor handling of the conflict as the reason.
",
7893,1,," civilian government was reinstated only a couple of weeks later with amadou sanogo standing down in favour of diouncounda traore the speaker of the parliament.
",
7894,1,," traore promised to “wage a total and relentless war” to reclaim the north of the country.
",
7895,1,,"while the coup had been going on however the malian army had effectively been forced out of the azawad region.
",
7896,1,," the mnla therefore declared independence and stopped advancing.
",
7897,1,," this however was not the end of conflict in the region as the mnla soon faced a challenge from the more islamist organisations ansar dine and movement for oneness and jihad in west africa (mowja) who wanted much stricter imposition of sharia law.
",
7898,1,," after clashes through the summer ofbetween the groups the mnla were forced out of much of the territory they had conquered, no one group has been able to control the whole region.
",
7899,1,,"the interim government of diouncounda traore  proved no more capable than its predecessors of forcing out the isla mists and separatists.
",
7900,1,," it therefore called the united nations, the african union and the economic community of west african states (ecowas) for help.
",
7901,1,," on 12th october the security council demanded “that all armed groups cease human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law” and “provide[d] military and security planners to assist ecowas and the african union… in the joint planning efforts… for an international military force”.
",
7902,1,," this however did not authorise force, and it quickly became apparent that there would be no intervention until the end of 2013.
",
7903,1,,"this however changed when the islamists launched a new offensive capturing the town of konna just 600km from the capital.
",
7904,1,," this meant that the french government felt ""we must stop the rebels' offensive, otherwise the whole of mali will fall into their hands - creating a threat for africa and even for europe"".
",
7905,1,," president hollande therefore ordered air strikes and the deployment of troops on the 11th january 2013.
",
7906,1,,"french forces intervened in operation serval, leading to all major cities returning in to the control of the malian government.
",
7907,1,," on the 27th of january french forces recaptured timbuktu, and gao soon after.
",
7908,1,," the french troops started withdrawing on the 25th of may but still (from february 2014) hastroops in the country.
",
7909,1,," this intervention was popular, with an al jazeera poll indicating that 96% of residents of bamako supported the french military role.
",
7910,0,," `` france has answered ... a request for assistance issued by the interim president of the republic of mali '' .
",
7911,0,," france is therefore not coming in uninvited .
",
7912,0,," mali 's president traore directly appealed to french president hollande to provide `` french military assistance against these terrorist groups '' that have `` attacked our front lines of defense '' .
",
7913,0,," as the former colonial power in much of west africa , including mali , france is the obvious country to turn to for help .
",
7914,0,," as a result of this colonial past mali is a member of the french led organisation internationale de la francophonie .
",
7915,0,," mali is therefore fully within its sovereign rights to ask for assistance and hollande is right to agree to provide it .
",
7916,0,," while it was tuareg separatists who first sparked the insurrection wanting to split mali but now the north has been taken over by islamists and al qaeda in the islamic maghreb presenting a terrorist threat that can not be ignored .
",
7917,0,," france 's defence minister jean-yves le drian says `` france 's goal is to lead a relentless struggle against terrorist groups , '' and that `` we have to eradicate this terrorism '' .
",
7918,0,," the united states was already clearly worried about mali becoming a center of terrorism having on the 7th december designated the movement for unity and jihad in west africa a terrorist organisation while other groups involved in mali such as al-qa ' ida in the islamic maghreb were already designated as such .
",
7919,0,," the state department highlights several terrorist attacks the group has conducted such as `` a marchsuicide attack on a police base in tamanrasset , algeria , which woundedpeople '' .
",
7920,0,," fundamentally at its heart this is a humanitarian intervention by the french .
",
7921,0,," the islamists who took over northern mali have been imposing a severe , austere form of islam demanding `` no cigarettes , no cds , no radios , no cameras , no jewelry '' and beating those who disobey the rules .
",
7922,0,," men and women have to sit in separate areas in buses .
",
7923,0,," with sharia being more strictly enforced with increasing number of amputations despite opposition from the local population .
",
7924,0,," much of the population of the north had already fled to the south with the un high commissioner for refugees saying 200,000 have fled since january.
",
7925,0,," those who have , like moussa from timbuktu , clearly welcome the intervention , he told a french radio station `` we have been suffocating and , france , has given us a breath of oxygen .
",
7926,0,," we are ready to fly malian and french flags alongside each other . ''
",
7927,0,," this intervention is not all about terrorism and a humanitarian desire to end a civil war .
",
7928,0,," france does have a stake in the conflict and a reason to deploy military forces .
",
7929,0,," there are 6,000 french citizens living in mali who are obviously at risk to a rebel advance ; even without a full scale intervention france would almost certainly have had to deploy forces to protect an evacuation .
",
7930,0,," already there are seven french citizens being held hostage in mali and rescuing them is one of the three main objectives for the french intervention .
",
7931,1,,"mercenaries, or dogs of war as they are popularly known, are defined by the un as combatants who are ‘motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party to the conflict, material compensation’.
",
7932,1,,"  the first accounted use of such forces was by pharaoh ramesses ii in ancient egypt, who employed roughly 11,000 mercenaries in the 13th century bce.
",
7933,1,," throughout the middle ages, mercenaries became prominent throughout italy where they were used by the city states to conduct their small scale conflicts.
",
7934,1,,"the use of hired soldiers continued in to the second half of the twentieth century where the african continent became a popular destination for those seeking well paid military work.
",
7935,1,," post-independent africa witnessed numerous inter-state and civil wars which created the opportunity for mercenaries to make use of their skill set.
",
7936,1,," the congo conflict in the 1960s saw mercenaries being hired by all sides of the conflict, setting the tone for the next forty years.
",
7937,1,," the end of the apartheid was another notable event for mercenary activity.
",
7938,1,," when racial-segregation ended in south africa there were many white citizens who left the army.
",
7939,1,," their professional skill set saw them employed throughout the conflicts on the 1990s, including sierra leone.
",
7940,1,," companies such as executive outcomes made significant profits off of these wars.
",
7941,1,,"since the 1980s however, states and international institutions have placed increasingly high restrictions on mercenaries.
",
7942,1,," theun mercenary convention outlawed the practice, with other states creating their own legislation to prevent their citizens from becoming hired guns.
",
7943,1,," with the decreasing instability of africa and competing actors, do mercenaries still have a place?
",
7944,0,," private military companies , pmcs , are independent , registered , corporate actors who have risen in prominence and replaced mercenaries in their security function .
",
7945,0,," pmcs are different to mercenaries in the sense that mercenaries will fight for the highest bidder .
",
7946,0,," pmcs on the other hand will only work for legitimate governments and intergovernmental organisations such as the un1 .
",
7947,0,," their main roles include ; support services , logical support , humanitarian support and the upholding of law and order and defensive military action2 .
",
7948,0,," pmc activity has seen corporations operating on behalf of the somalian government training coast guards to deal with the threat of piracy which peaked in.
",
7949,0,," the legal status of pmcs , compared with mercenaries , makes them a preferable choice for the aforementioned tasks reducing the prominence of illegal hired guns .

'
",
7951,0,," ,nation states and the united nations have passed laws making mercenary activity illegal .
",
7952,0,," legislation against mercenaries prevent either seeking employment as a mercenary or hiring one .
",
7953,0,," western states such as austria and germany have made it illegal for citizens to become mercenaries , revoking their citizenship if they choose to do so anyway6 .
",
7954,0,," south africa , a major source of hired guns , passed the ` foreign military assistance act ' inwhich prohibited citizens from joining foreign wars with the exception of humanitarian intervention .
",
7955,0,," in international law , the united nations has outlawed mercenaries through the un mercenary convention ofwhich bans the use of foreign soldiers from fighting for profit .
",
7956,0,," finally , many african states have passed further legislation which restricts mercenaries operating in their countries .
",
7957,0,," the trial of thirteen mercenaries in angola and the arrests of simon mann 's unit zimbabwe inwere both due to their mercenary status .
",
7958,0,," the increased legal pressure is a symptom of changing attitudes towards the use of mercenaries in africa .
",
7959,0,," 6 , mian , q. ` legal status of mercenaries ' the decline of conflicts and mercenary freedom on the african continent has meant less work for mercenaries .
",
7960,0,," the congo conflict of the 1960s , is seen as the first mercenary age8 .
",
7961,0,," hired guns fought on all sides of the conflict and enjoyed the freedom to act at their discretion .
",
7962,0,," theexecution of mercenaries in angola was seen as a symbolic ending of this age .
",
7963,0,," that said , mercenaries were still prevalent into the 1990s and early 2000s .
",
7964,0,," since the peak of the 1990s , however , there has been a noticeable decrease in the number of conflicts in africa fromcivil wars andinterstate wars tomajor civil wars and no interstate wars9 ,10 .
",
7965,0,," as wars and civil unrest are an obvious source of employment for mercenaries ; this decrease in conflict leaves them with fewer opportunities .
",
7966,0,," the african union 's promise to end war on the continent byalso puts the future prospects of mercenaries in to question .
",
7967,0,," 8 , keane , f. ` there will be work for mercenaries in africa until democracy replaces dictatorships '9 , the world bank ` world development report' pg .52 10 , wikipedia ` list of ongoing armed conflicts ' the increased presence of democracies on the african continent has led to greater security .
",
7968,0,," mercenary activity is usually associated with the presence of bad governance , which is most commonly featured in dictatorships .
",
7969,0,," dictatorships generally lead to corruption , unrest and economic collapse .
",
7970,0,," the dispossessed in society then begin to resist , with the ensuing conflict providing employment opportunities for mercenaries .
",
7971,0,," a prime example of this being equatorial guinea , where mercenary simon mann planned to use popular support to remove the infamous teodoro nguema13 .
",
7972,0,," since the first mercenary age , however , the number of democracies has increased fromtowhich has reduced instability on the continent in some regions , reducing opportunities for mercenaries .
",
7973,0,," 13 , keane , f. ` there will be work for mercenaries in africa until democracy replaces dictatorships '
",
7974,1,,"the role that the developed world should play on the international stage has been a constant battle throughout its history between those that favour isolationism and those that favour a more engaged overseas policy.
",
7975,1,," from the early nineteenth-century european powers set out an imperialist project to 'humanise' the 'less advanced' peripheral countries of africa, asia and south america1.
",
7976,1,," by way of contrast, 'splendid isolation' was the policy adopted by imperial britain in the late nineteenth-century under the government of disraeli and the marquis of salisbury whereby they did not intervene in the affairs of other countries unless it absolutely involved great britain; this inevitably meant a withdrawal from the practice of promoting the 'humanising' political system, at least in europe2.
",
7977,1,," these two policies embody the different attitudes to foreign policy among world powers.
",
7978,1,,"in the new millennium however, what democracy promotion means and implies is a very important issue with many far reaching consequences.
",
7979,1,," traditionally developed countries have supported democracy promotion through aid programs and development assistance.
",
7980,1,," as key stakeholders in multilateral institutions such as the world bank, imf and world trade organization, developed countries are in a strong position (some say too strong a position) to attach democratic conditions to aid and trade deals, should it so wish.
",
7981,1,," propaganda and other such soft, persuasive methods are more popular as they are seen as being less intrusive.
",
7982,1,," however, with the recent wars in iraq, afghanistan and libya the use of military force to promote democracy has entered into the debate as well.
",
7983,1,,"the question is, should countries be pressured to conform to what is simply the current predominant mode of government in the western world?
",
7984,0,," or is democracy an inherently superior system that we should strive to see implemented across the globe?
",
7985,0,,"the primary justification for democracy promotion is the democratic peace theory .
",
7986,0,," the theory of the democratic peace goes back to immanuel kant 's essay ` perpetual peace ' , which he published in; perpetual peace refers to a state of affairs where peace is permanently established over a certain area , as the roman and british empires attempted to do during their respective periods of dominance in history .
",
7987,0,," kant 's theory was that the majority of people would never go to war , unless in self-defence2 .
",
7988,0,," democracies tend not to go to war as often as other countries because their military is more directly under civilian control .
",
7989,0,," authoritarian governments or those heavily underpinned by their respective armies , by contrast , have no such barriers to whimsical invasions of other countries , nor the use of the national army to suppress their own people in a bid to solidify power .
",
7990,0,," communist north korea is just one example of a country whose foreign policy is extremely aggressive as a direct result of its political inclinations3 .
",
7991,0,," therefore if all countries were democracies there would be no wars as there would be no aggressors .
",
7992,0,," given the peaceful nature of democratic states , it is clearly in the interest of the usa to promote democratic change worldwide .
",
7993,0,," democracy is a universal value which knows no cultural boundaries .
",
7994,0,," the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ``.
",
7995,0,," it is a fallacy to suggest that we should excuse countries from this clause because their culture seems to preach otherwise .
",
7996,0,," the principles of democracy are something that everyone is entitled to simply because they are right and fair .
",
7997,0,," democracy should not be reserved as a privilege for those who happen to be born in a culture that already supports it ; we must endeavour to make all countries believe in the veracity of this declaration .
",
7998,0,," democracy is good for the worldwide economy , as its values of openness and accountability promote the rule of law and good governance in the people 's interest .
",
7999,0,," the threat that the electorate will not re-elect them at the next election forces governments to adopt social and economic policies which will make their citizens richer and more secure .
",
8000,0,," in practice this means creating open markets friendly to inward investment and eager for trade , while reining in corruption , military spending and aggressive foreign policies .
",
8001,0,," china is a good example here .
",
8002,0,," of course it is by no means democratic , but in order to continue its economic boom it has over the last ten years had to open up its business practices to the world .
",
8003,0,," integration into the world economy , for example , joining the wto , has led to greater transparency1 .
",
8004,0,," because encouraging such policies is clearly in the economic interests of all current democracies , they should actively seek to promote democracy abroad as the best way to achieve wealth .
",
8005,0,," `` everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person ``, `` everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ``and `` everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country , directly or through freely chosen representatives ``are three of the most fundamental tenets of democratic society .
",
8006,0,," the vote ensures that public expression can take place peacefully , instead of violently .
",
8007,0,," free speech provides a legitimate avenue through which to address the government and ease tensions in society that could potentially turn violent .
",
8008,0,," for these reasons , democracies tend not to suppress their people using violence , as in the case of the tiananmen square incident in communist china4 or with the `` tulip revolution '' in authoritarian kyrgystan5 .
",
8009,0,," in fact , democracies tend to have constitutions , which ensure the government can not violently suppress peaceful dissent , and must always honour the beliefs of the majority of its people .
",
8010,0,," everyone should have a right to live without fear of suppression and with the ability to voice their opinions and beliefs .
",
8011,0,," because such values are written deep within the heart of the democracies , our governments should seek to export them wherever possible abroad .
",
8012,0,," if western democracies are to live up to their calling as `` shining beacons '' for all mankind , it should seek to promote democratization as the best means of improving human well-being around the world .
",
8013,1,,"a standing army is a permanent military force, entirely under the command of a single authority.
",
8014,1,," this is almost always a national government, although in the past european colonial companies sometimes maintained their own private military forces, as did feudal barons and warlords (for example, in china in the 1920s).
",
8015,1,," at present the un has no military force of its own to send on peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions.
",
8016,1,," instead, it has to gather together troops and equipment volunteered by member states on an ad hoc basis for each individual crisis.
",
8017,1,,"a un standing army  would be under the control of the unsc; if individual states could pull troops out of it when they chose to (for example because they disagreed with the objective of a particular mission), then it would not fulfil the true definition of a standing army.
",
8018,1,," there are significant practical issues to be considered: how large the force would be?
",
8019,1,," what military capabilities it would have (e.g. would it have air and sea power?)
",
8020,1,,"?
",
8021,1,," how it would be recruited?
",
8022,1,," how it would be funded and where it might be based.
",
8023,1,,"?
",
8024,1,," to what extent it would add to or replace the existing methods of raising troops should also be considered?
",
8025,1,," long term peacekeeping missions (for example, in cyprus or bosnia) might still be undertaken by detachments volunteered by individual states, while the un standing army might be deployed to deal with short-term crises.
",
8026,0,," a strong , effective and impartial united nations standing army would deny powerful military states the right to bully and blackmail rivals into submission with the threat of military force .
",
8027,0,," a un army would be able to balance that threat with their own willingness to come to the aid of states under military duress .
",
8028,0,," the united states , unwilling to risk a protracted conflict against a respected , well-trained multi-national force would have to fall back .
",
8029,0,," to use an example , american military intervention in vietnam , against the wishes of the majority of the population , could have been prevented had a u.n. standing army existed to respond to the wishes of the vietnamese people and stand against the united states ' intervention .
",
8030,0,," the existence of such a military rival would therefore force the united states to increase its investment in its state department and diplomatic solutions to political crises .
",
8031,0,," ultimately , peace would be more effectively maintained .
",
8032,0,," changes in modern warfare dictate the need for an impartial , rapidly-deploying , multi-national force .
",
8033,0,," modern warfare is no longer the trench battles of battalions aligned to a flag , it is increasingly police actions designed to prevent the resort to warfare in the first place or enforce ceasefires once they have begun .
",
8034,0,," as such , the impartiality of a un standing army would be highly valuable , offering both parties in the conflict a neutral peacemaker and peacekeeper .
",
8035,0,," contrast this to the perceived differences in attitude between troops from britain , the us , russia and france to warring sides in the balkans .
",
8036,0,," it would be free of accusations of meddling and self-interest that accompany the participation of troops from neighbouring states in un interventions , for example , nigeria in west african missions .
",
8037,0,," a un standing army could overcome local civilian suspicion , free from the threat of propaganda from those opposed to it and free from the restraints of state power on those troops involved .
",
8038,0,," furthermore , a un standing army would be able to deploy much faster than current peacekeeping missions which are held back by the bureaucracy of finding troops , equipment and funding .
",
8039,0,," the present system takes months to put forces in the field , and these are often inadequate to the task in hand , as member states have pledged fewer troops than were requested and they then struggle to co-ordinate across cultural and linguistic barriers .
",
8040,0,," this has meant the un has often acted too late , with too little force , and has thereby failed to avert humanitarian disasters in such places as central africa , bosnia , sierra leone and somalia .
",
8041,0,," a un standing army would be permanently available and able to deploy rapidly to contain crises before they turn into full-scale wars and humanitarian disasters .
",
8042,0,," without an independent army , the un has ` no capacity to avert such catastrophes 'for it simply can not raise forces quickly or effectively enough .
",
8043,0,,"  johansen , r. c.  .
",
8044,0,," a united nations emergency peace service to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity , p..
",
8045,0,," a un standing army would be more effective than the variety of troops staffing missions under the current system .
",
8046,0,," at present most un operations are supplied by developing nations who hope to make a profit from the payments they receive for their services , but who are under-equipped and badly trained .
",
8047,0,," forces from the major powers are provided sparingly and only after substantial public pressure or when there exists an incentive for their use .
",
8048,0,," a un standing army would be better prepared , both in regards to training and equipment , and its soldiers would have greater motivation as they would have made a choice to enlist , rather than being conscripts forced by their own states to fight someone else 's war .
",
8049,0,," a single un force would also have better command and control than in current situations , when different national forces and their commanders often fail to work effectively together in the field for cultural and linguistic reasons .
",
8050,0,," successful forces such as the french foreign legion , the indian army and the roman army show that issues of language and culture need not be problems in combat situations .
",
8051,0,," they can be overcome through a strong professional ethos and a commitment to a mutual cause , values that can only be expected to develop if troops prepare , train and fight together .
",
8052,1,,"popular demonstrations started in syria in march and aprilas part of the arab spring movement that swept across large areas of the middle east.
",
8053,1,," this deteriorated in to a civil war.
",
8054,1,,"both sides, the assad government and to a lesser extent the rebels, have been accused of grave human rights abuses.
",
8055,1,," this includes including the use of chemical weapons against civilians, most likely by the assad regime as they are the ones with control over chemical weapons, as well as the deliberate targeted killing of civilians, and widespread rapes.
",
8056,1,," the rebels have been accused of summary killings of soldiers and civilians they have captured, including an incident caught on video where a boy, whose age would make him a child soldier under the rome statute, kills a syrian colonel with a machete.
",
8057,1,,"this has led to calls for military intervention by the us and france, with some support from the british government, who lost a parliamentary vote on the issue.
",
8058,1,," this is a course of action opposed by china and russia.
",
8059,1,,"however, there have been suggestions, including by the british government and human rights watch that the case should be referred to the international criminal court to put various figures in the conflict, likely including bashar al-assad on trial.
",
8060,1,," if he were to go on trial at the icc, he would be one of a small number of former heads of state, including charles taylor and slobodan milosevic, to have been tried before an international court.
",
8061,1,,"neither syria, or lebanon, which is being affected by overspill of the conflict, have ratified the rome statute to the international criminal court.
",
8062,1,," therefore, in order for this to be added to the jurisdiction of the icc, a reference by the un security council would be necessary.
",
8063,0,," the purpose of the icc is to be the venue for the implementation of international criminal law , a principle that the international community has supported since the creation of the icty and ictr and prior to that .
",
8064,0,," the crimes that the court is to prosecute include genocide -- which is probably not occurring but has been alleged , crimes against humanity and war crimes -- which have certainly happened the chemical attacks being just one among many examples .
",
8065,0,," the allegations against the assad regime are serious -- including the use of chemical weapons , which are specifically mentioned as a war crime under article 8/1/b / xviii the rome statute .
",
8066,0,," it would set a terrible precedent for such crimes to not be punished under international criminal law .
",
8067,0,," the icc has a high level of soft power in this case .
",
8068,0,," it has the resources to investigate and prosecute , backed up by widespread support from large swathes of the international community .
",
8069,0,," the icc is part of a growing international norm against war and crimes against humanity .
",
8070,0,," the willingness to prosecute for these crimes -- particularly if it is done consistently -- will build norms where even ruthless leaders realise they ca n't get away with such crimes .
",
8071,0,," pursuing war crimes from the syrian conflict alone will not be enough but when combined with similar measures elsewhere and the arrests of other leaders such as charles taylor , slobodan milosevic and laurent gbagbo show that even leaders are no longer out of reach of international law .
",
8072,0,," the icc could act as an effective deterrent to the use of chemical weapons and other war crimes by threatening to prosecute individuals who commit them .
",
8073,0,," the use of the icc could work better than domestic show trials in the aftermath of a civil war .
",
8074,0,," instead of domestic courts , prone to all their biases , an international , unbiased , criminal system could replace the prospect of a ceausescu-style non-trial followed by summary execution , or some other form of unfair trial which could sow the seeds for problems down the line .
",
8075,0,," even the trial of iraqi dictator saddam hussein done while the united states had a lot of influence over the country as a result of its occupation was condemned as having `` serious administrative , procedural and substantive legal defects '' .
",
8076,0,," instead , an icc trial would allow the full details to be probed , investigated and independently prosecuted without being subject to domestic post-war recriminations .
",
8077,0,," the un security council has so far been undecided over any future action in syria .
",
8078,0,," china has so far been unconvinced over any action .
",
8079,0,," russia has supported assad , selling the assad regime arms .
",
8080,0,," russia and china , being permanent members of the unsc means that they can block any action on this issue that the other permanent members , usa , uk and france , may wish to bring for any form of sanction towards the assad regime .
",
8081,0,," while it may not be possible to get russia to support a military intervention , which is something that they are opposed to , it may be possible to swing russia round to a position where they abstain on a reference to the icc .
",
8082,0,," russia has had a flexible , or , more cynically , hypocritical , view on the icc before , opposing a syria reference in februarybut supporting one in to the actions of nato in the syrian conflict , position on the icc , having voted in favour of references to it before .
",
8083,0,," because the involvement of the icc would mean investigating both sides it would not be entirely impossible for a diplomatic solution to be reached for russia to abstain on a reference .
",
8084,1,,"the internet is increasingly seen as a potential battleground of the future, while there would be few casualties in such warfare it would have an impact on the real world.
",
8085,1,," while the director of national intelligence has poured cold water over the idea that there might be a ‘digital pearl harbour’ in the next few years the possibility that cyber-attacks could knock out the u.s. electric grid has been recognised.
",
8086,1,,"  the united states military has gone so far as to suggest that they would consider military action in response to such acts with one military official suggesting “if you shut down our power grid, maybe we will put a missile down one of your smokestacks.”
",
8087,1,," there have even been suggestions from the defense service board that in the case of the biggest possible cyber-attacks the united states could not rule out a nuclear response.
",
8088,1,,"as yet however there have been no cases of cyber warfare but there have been increasing problems with cyber-attacks in a peace time situation; companies such as the new york times and google have been hacked, a virus called stuxnet put back iran’s nuclear program, and most of estonia’s internet was reduced to a crawl inas a result of a distributed denial of service (ddos) attack.
",
8089,1,," david rothkopf has suggested that cyber-attacks will result in a ‘cool war’ in which there is little military action but persistent tension as a result of minor actions such as cyber-attacks he says “the purpose of cool war is to be able to strike out constantly without triggering hot war while also making hot wars less desirable (much as did nuclear technology during cold war days) or even necessary.”
",
8090,1,," if this becomes the case then the internet will surely be where this mostly happens.
",
8091,1,," this makes it important that there is some formal way of responding to cyber-attacks that does not involve military action as the next step in escalation.
",
8092,1,," instead there needs to be a mechanism to resolve disputes and penalise the offender.
",
8093,1,,"fortunately at the same time as the us suggested the military option would not be off the table it accepted it would be a last resort and diplomatic, informational, and economic would come first “as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law”.
",
8094,1,,"so what are cyber-attacks and the proposed targeted sanctions?
",
8095,1,,"nato defines cyber attacks to be ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’ this is useful for defining what attacks might be just cause for a military response but this is a very high bar at the moment as few attacks cause immediate physical damage.
",
8096,1,," sanctions could be used in response to much lower level attacks.
",
8097,1,," businesses in particular would be keen to have the government help prevent the stealing of intellectual property through the imposition of sanctions.
",
8098,1,," so we would simply be imposing sanctions when the economic losses are quantifiable and sufficient to be worth government effort to prevent.
",
8099,1,,"sanctions are the use of economic pressure by a state (or group) of states in an attempt to get another state to change a policy.
",
8100,1,," the pressure is either through direct economic pain on the actor launching the attacks or to encourage public pressure.
",
8101,1,," in this case sanctions would be either attempting to prevent a state from launching cyber attacks of its own or to persuade it to crack down on non-state actors that are launching these attacks.
",
8102,0,," cyber-attacks pose a distinct problem for international diplomacy in that they are difficult to prevent and difficult to respond to .
",
8103,0,," any kind of military response as the united states has threatened would be completely disproportionate against all but the very biggest of cyber-attacks , those that actually result in deaths , diplomacy on the other hand is as good as no response , if the response is simply a tongue lashing then the benefits of cyber espionage will be far higher than the cost .
",
8104,0,," the only proportionate , and therefore just , response to a cyber-attack is sanctions .
",
8105,0,," the sanctions can be used to impose a similar economic cost on the offending state as that caused by the cyber-attack .
",
8106,0,," this would be just like the world trade organisation 's dispute settlement rules .
",
8107,0,," they allow for the imposition of trade sanctions to a similar value to the losses being experienced as a result of protectionist action , with the sanctions sometimes on differing sectors to those where there are unfair trade practices .
",
8108,0,," alternatively sanctions could mean a proportionate internet response ; users from the offending nation could be prohibited from using internet services , for example an attack by hackers on the us could result in people from that country being blocked from google and other us internet services .
",
8109,0,," the big advantage of sanctions is that they can be as finely targeted as needed .
",
8110,0,," if the sanctioning country only knows which country the cyber attack originated from then they can be broad brush sanctions , but if there is knowledge of which group initiated the attack then the sanctions can be more specific .
",
8111,0,," for example in the case of unitof the chinese people 's liberation army that mandiant showed has been attacking us companies the united states could target sanctions at the people 's liberation army by tightening weapons bans .
",
8112,0,," alternatively if the hackers are private then banning the import of certain computer equipment into that country would be appropriate .
",
8113,0,," if individuals are known then the sanctions can be even more targeted , for example by freezing any bank accounts held outside their own country as the us did against north korea when it sanctioned banco delta asia through which north korea laundered money from criminal activities .
",
8114,0,," at the moment the response to cyber-attacks has essentially been nothing .
",
8115,0,," it is however clear that some response is needed as without a reaction there is no deterrence ; the attacks will keep coming until something is done .
",
8116,0,," the number of cyber-attacks and the sensitivity of the information stolen have been increasing over recent years and as more and more work is done online and more and more systems are connected to the internet so cyber-attacks become more attractive .
",
8117,0,," there needs to be a deterrent and the best deterrent is to make sure that such attacks are costly .
",
8118,0,," as these attacks are usually cross border , and in this debate we are only concerned with cross border attacks , then the only way to create a cost is through sanctions .
",
8119,0,," these sanctions can either hit the assailant directly or else hit his government so encouraging them to crack down on hacking emanating from their country .
",
8120,0,," it should be remembered that china argues that it does not launch cyber-attacks meaning that any such attacks from china must duly be private .
",
8121,0,," if this is the case then sanctions are the best way of prompting internal law enforcement .
",
8122,0,," sanctions therefore encourage all nations where there are cyber criminals to make sure they take such cyber-crime seriously .
",
8123,0,," if they do not get their own cyber criminals under control then they may be affected by sanctions .
",
8124,0,," cyber conflict favours the offence ; when the defender is successful they gain nothing and impose no harm on the attacker who is free to try again elsewhere .
",
8125,0,," the attackers are free to attack until they get past the defences somewhere .
",
8126,0,," that the attacks do n't risk lives helps to encourage an offensive mindset as makes it seem like there is no downside to attempting to dominate your opponent .
",
8127,0,," this means the only cyber response is to attack the attacker so that the same advantages apply .
",
8128,0,," the result is that cyber-attacks have a very real danger of long term tension or escalation .
",
8129,0,," if one side is losing a conflict where both sides are attempting to steal the other 's intellectual property , or the other has little to steal , the response may be something like the stuxnet attack that involves physical damage , this then would probably be considered an illegal use of force creating a thin line between a cyber-war and a real war .
",
8130,0,," when the cyber war involves physical damage as the us has warned there then may be a military response .
",
8131,0,," sanctions are a way to apply pressure without this risk of escalation into a military conflict .
",
8132,1,,"the european constitution is an attempt to provide an overall restructuring of the current eu institutional layout in order to deal with important challenges such as continuing eu enlargement, the eu integration process and the increasing role the eu is expected to play in world affairs.
",
8133,1,," the first proposition for a constitutional treaty was signed in rome on the 29th october 2004.
",
8134,1,," it combines and extends the different treaties on which the eu is currently based and presents it as one document that needs to be ratified by all member states in order to take action.
",
8135,1,,"the treaty document proposes a series of important reforms.
",
8136,1,," these include combining the three pillars into which current eu policy is divided, and clarifying in more detail the role of the eu parliament, council and commission, giving almost exclusive legislative initiative and executive power to the commission.
",
8137,1,," the constitutional treaty was ratified by national parliaments or referenda in eighteen eu member states, but has been rejected in referenda by two more.
",
8138,1,," the ‘no’ votes need not have stopped the ratification process elsewhere, but a constitutional treaty cannot come into effect without the approval of alleu states so in practice the proposed constitution was dead.
",
8139,1,,"the situation with eu law has undergone a major change inwhen the lisbon treaty came in action.
",
8140,1,," the lisbon treaty contains many of the changes the constitution attempted to introduce, for example: a politician chosen to be president of the european council for two-and-a-half years; a new post - called high representative - to give the eu more influence on the world stage and others.
",
8141,1,," however there are also differences between the constitution and the lisbon treaty, which made the ratification of the treaty a fact.
",
8142,1,," on an examination of the text of both documents, it seems that the substance of the lisbon treaty is largely similar to that of, the now defunct, the european constitution in terms of the reforms it institutes.
",
8143,1,,"  however, much of the symbolism of the constitution has not been reproduced in the lisbon treaty.
",
8144,1,,"  more significant perhaps, is the fact that the term “constitution” appears nowhere in the text of the lisbon treaty.
",
8145,1,," the lisbon treaty possesses several distinct features which are highly indicative of the fact that it is not a formal constitution as such.
",
8146,1,," in addition to its lack of symbolism, the lisbon treaty was not designed to stand alone but rather, merely, to amend the existing treaties.
",
8147,1,,"the current debate will examine whether the eu needs a true constitution other than the lisbon treaty from two aspects.
",
8148,1,," it is both a practical debate (does the eu need a constitution?)
",
8149,1,," and a more abstract debate (is the eu the kind of entity/organisation that should adopt a constitution?)
",
8150,0,," the arguments for and against an eu constitution rest on complicated issues of law, sovereignty, political philosophy and the efficiency and effectiveness of the eu’s institutions and procedures.
",
8151,0,,"a comprehensive reform of the eu institutional layout is a must given the pressures created by the continuing enlargement process as well as the integration process .
",
8152,0,," the existing eu architecture worked fine for a community of six states , and even for a group of twelve , but it is now desperately out-dated and unsuitable for a union ofor more .
",
8153,0,," for example , the national veto still applies in many areas , meaning one state can block progress even when the otheragree .
",
8154,0,," even when agreement is reached , it is often agonisingly slow and difficult to implement across the whole of the union , often having to pass through every parliament .
",
8155,0,," as a result eu decision-making has often been criticised as slow , complex and producing too many ` lowest common denominator ' solutions , therefore ireland can bring to a halt a vital treaty like lisbon and the role of the presidency and ` foreign minister ' is a compromise that does not result in more unified policy .
",
8156,0,," while still leaving the people feeling distant from the eu 's political processes , undermining legitimacy .
",
8157,0,," a constitutional treaty is the only comprehensive tool that exists right now in order to allow for this necessary overall reform .
",
8158,0,," the current treaty-basis for the european union is enormous , ambiguous and extremely complicated .
",
8159,0,," the existing treaties regulate multiple levels from the constitutional to detailed market regulations .
",
8160,0,," as a result of this individuals can not easily read and understand the treaties as a us citizen for example .
",
8161,0,," it is difficult to keep track of each new treaty that amends the pre-existing treaties .
",
8162,0,," the adoption of a shorter , clearer document will make the eu much more ` user friendly . '
",
8163,0,," the eu currently suffers from the fact that many of its citizens do not know what it is or what it does ; eu citizens either do not know where to look for this information or are deterred and intimidated by the size of the treaty of rome and the maastricht treaty .
",
8164,0,," having an easily digestible constitution will mean that the eu 's citizens can easily find out what the eu is and what it does .
",
8165,0,," since the maastricht treaty , the citizens of eu member states have possessed parallel citizenship of the eu .
",
8166,0,," however , european citizens do not identify themselves with the eu in the way that citizens of the usa self-identify as american .
",
8167,0,," an important part of the patriotism of americans is ` constitutional patriotism ; ' pride in their constitution and civic institutions .
",
8168,0,," the european union aims to bring about ever closer union between the peoples of europe .
",
8169,0,," it should foster a shared sense of ` european identity ' by adopting a constitution , in which every citizen of the eu can take pride .
",
8170,0,," the european court of justice , ecj , has long treated the founding treaties as the constitutional documents of the european union .
",
8171,0,," many commentators have noted the efforts of the ecj to `` constitutionalise '' many principles -- such as the direct effect and supremacy of community law over the domestic laws of member states and the increasing protection of human rights -- the ecj is often overstepping its bounds when it comes to applying and interpreting the treaties .
",
8172,0,," the ecj has often been accused of `` judicial activism '' in over-stepping the legitimate boundaries of courts in a democracy .
",
8173,0,," by enshrining much of this creative jurisprudence in a democratically ratified constitution , the eu can assert and emphasise its status as a democratic entity , rather than an elite-driven process separate from the citizens of europe .
",
8174,1,,"turkey has had a trade agreement with the european union for over forty years, and first applied for membership of europe’s premier club nearly forty years ago.
",
8175,1,," until ten years ago these requests were politely resisted; turkey was never turned down outright but the eu made it clear that massive political and economic reforms would be needed before entry could even be considered.
",
8176,1,," in 1999, however, eu leaders unanimously accepted turkey as a candidate country, yet negotiations about entry did not begin until 2005.
",
8177,1,,"sincethe eu accession negotiations for croatia and iceland have advanced rapidly, but only one out ofchapters has been completed with turkey;have yet to be opened at all.
",
8178,1,," this has led to turkish suspicion that the eu is not really serious about ever including it.
",
8179,1,," this suspicion seemed to be confirmed in november 2002, when valery giscard d’estaing, a former president of france, declared that turkey was an asiatic nation that should never be allowed to join the european union.
",
8180,1,," since then it has become the policy of france, germany and austria to oppose turkish membership of the eu.
",
8181,1,," they and some politicians in other eu states would prefer to offer a privileged partnership short of full membership; something which turkey rejects.
",
8182,0,," greece and cyprus do not reject the prospect of turkish membership outright, but are insistent that progress should be dependent upon turkey abandoning support for northern cyprus.
",
8183,0,,"the eu has welcomed poorer entrants than turkey without disaster ; ireland , spain , portugal and greece were all much poorer than the eu average when they joined and all are now well integrated and much more prosperous .
",
8184,0,," disastrous migration was forecast in their cases too , but did not occur .
",
8185,0,," nor is turkey as poor as has been suggested ; turkey with a gdp per capita of $inis richer than romania at $and bulgaria with a gdp per capita of $both of which are already members .
",
8186,0,," turkey 's economy is also in the process of reform , including the restructuring of its banking system and imf programmes ; in the next few years this process will allow for faster , more sustained growth .
",
8187,0,," turkey provides a large new market for eu goods ; should it be accepted into the single market the economic benefits would not be solely limited to that country .
",
8188,0,," turkey 's inclusion in the eu would not threaten other members with overwhelming economic or immigration issues .
",
8189,0,," it is possible that , as has happened with bulgaria and romania , that a delay is enacted for the schengen passport-free zone .
",
8190,0,," this would give both the current eu and turkey a period of time to adjust .
",
8191,0,," romania and bulgaria , who have by far the worst human rights ' records , were prioritized over turkey when they were granted the right of accession , joining the eu in.
",
8192,0,," the eu rewarded states that have made a big effort to democratize and change policy in order to be allowed in to the eu .
",
8193,0,," by essentially procrastinating on turkey 's case , the eu are discouraging turkey from making the required changes to their legislature and norms and thus hindering their chances of accession .
",
8194,0,," countries such as hungary , poland , and the czech republic were pressurized to reform at a rapid pace after being promised by the eu they would likely be in the eu in a relatively short period of time ; turkey has been given no such promises .
",
8195,0,," turkey should have even more ` right ' to be in the eu as these states , as it formally applied for membership long before these states and should thus be given priority over them .
",
8196,0,," turkey is a key geo-political strategic ally to the west and should be integrated fully in order to ensure its continued cooperation .
",
8197,0,," `` turkey is a secular muslim democracy and a crucial ally for the west .
",
8198,0,," the eastern flank of nato , straddling europe and asia , it played a critical role in containing the soviet union during the cold war .
",
8199,0,," in the 1990s , it helped monitor saddam hussein and protect iraqi kurds by permitting u.s. warplanes to use its bases .
",
8200,0,," after the september attacks , it became a staging area for coalition forces in afghanistan , where turkish forces eventually assumed overall command of the international stabilization force .
",
8201,0,," turkey continues to be a pivotal partner in the fight against al qaeda and other terrorist groups , despite attacks by radical islamists at home . ''
",
8202,0,," turkey was promised a chance to join the eu by a unanimous vote at the helsinki summit in, when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent turkish requests .
",
8203,0,," as a candidate country turkey should be allowed in once it meets the membership criteria which were first set out in the copenhagen european council of.
",
8204,0,," these were stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for and protection of minorities , the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union and the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political , economic & monetary union .
",
8205,0,," clearly economic and political reforms are necessary , but that is true of all states attempting to join the eu and should not be used as an excuse to backtrack now .
",
8206,0,," it would be hypocritical to apply one set of criteria to central and eastern european states and another to turkey .
",
8207,0,," such blatant hypocrisy would have consequences , if the eu is seen to break its promise to turkey it may turn a potential friend and partner into a suspicious and hostile neighbour .
",
8208,1,,"the war in iraq is likely to be remembered for decades, if not centuries, as the defining conflict of the early 21st century.
",
8209,1,," the effect it had not only in the nation and country itself in radicalizing an entire generation as well as the toxic effect it had on those politicians most closely associated with it may well stand as a legacy to how not to fight a war.
",
8210,1,,"however, as the original reasons for going in fade into history – and they were never that clear in the first place – the issue of what has been accomplished becomes an interesting one.
",
8211,1,," it would be foolish to assert that everything went according to plan, and proposition will have to demonstrate benefits from some unusual sources.
",
8212,1,," however unlikely it may seem, such benefits do exist.
",
8213,1,,"the first and most obvious one is that saddam hussein, and his genocidal regime, is no longer in power.
",
8214,1,," instead there is, by the standards of the region, a democratic, relatively stable and relatively transparent nation state.
",
8215,1,," it may not be switzerland but the difference between the country the allies entered and the one they are leaving could not be clearer.
",
8216,1,,"equally, although it will come as little consolation to the families of those who have died the knowledge gained about how wars in the 21st century need to be fought can be used to save lives in the future.
",
8217,1,," especially given the instability of the middle east as a whole and the growing scarcity of oil, it seems unlikely that this is the last desert war the west will be fighting in the decades to come.
",
8218,1,,"equally, the impact it had on the west is instructive.
",
8219,1,," when britain and france chose to intervene in libya, sarkosy and cameron did so in the shadow of baghdad and the difference in their approach could not have been more different from the gung-ho, militaristic approach taken by blair and bush.
",
8220,1,," instead they adopted very clear goals, were very clear on the need for indigenous allies, and refused to put boots on the ground.
",
8221,1,," it seems that they acknowledged that their electorates would not stomach another war conducted along the lines of iraq.
",
8222,1,,"it would stretch credulity to suggest that there is a direct link between the fall of baghdad and the arab spring.
",
8223,1,," however, that synchronicity of the two events may ultimately prove beneficial.
",
8224,1,," the middle east would have been a lonely place for a democratic state and now there are at least a handful to build upon.
",
8225,1,,"although the cost in lives – lost and broken – is almost too ghastly to contemplate and the effects on the economies of all concerned has been devastating, there are some positives that have come out of the conflict.
",
8226,1,," benefits that would not be available with saddam left in power.
",
8227,1,," the balance of probability now seems to be that the future generations living in a free and democratic iraq will give thanks to those who died to start the nation on its long road to freedom.
",
8228,0,," it 's important to be clear that this debate is looking at the results of the iraq war and , by any definition iraq is in a much more stable and secure position than it was inwhen american , british and other international troops arrived in the country .
",
8229,0,," this was n't just about removing one tyrant ; the regime had dynastic ambitions , and a failure to act would have created the equivalent of north korea .
",
8230,0,," however , this particular hermit kingdom would have been sitting on top of the second largest reserves of oil in the world .
",
8231,0,," it would , therefore , have the capacity to create the sort of fear and chaos kim jong il can only dream of .
",
8232,0,," it was better to remove this threat than risk being drawn into a multi-player conflict when he next attacked a neighbor .
",
8233,1,,"theottawa convention banned the use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines.
",
8234,1,," one hundred and thirty-three nations have signed the convention – the usa has not although inthe obama administration announced a review of us policy that might lead to it signing up to the ottawa convention.
",
8235,1,," the convention's aims became official united nations policy with general assembly resolution 53/77.
",
8236,1,," the ottawa convention requires those that do so to abandon the use of landmines within ten years, and also requires the destruction of the signatory's stockpile of landmines.
",
8237,1,,"the main reason the us gives for its refusal to sign the ottawa convention is that it feels there should be a unique exception for the landmines in the korean demilitarized zone to recognise the military necessity of preventing movement across that border.
",
8238,0,," landmines are a terrible and immoral tool of war .
",
8239,0,," america should neither practise nor condone this kind of warfare .
",
8240,0,," unlike other weaponry , landmines remain hidden in the ground long after conflicts have ended , killing and maiming civilians in some of the world 's poorest countries years , even decades later .
",
8241,0,," in afghanistan% of victims are children .
",
8242,0,," even if other weaponry has similar effects , it does n't mean landmines are acceptable -- it means they are bad , too .
",
8243,0,," but we must start somewhere -- we can make a difference by capitalising on the global movement against landmines , and we should .
",
8244,0,," the usefulness of landmines is significantly over-represented .
",
8245,0,," they are easily removed by quite low-technology military equipment -- which means that they are not very dangerous to armed forces whose mobility is not significantly restricted , this is after-all the purpose of the mines , but are incredibly harmful to civilians .
",
8246,0,," a significant problem is that many minefields have been left unmarked and that they can remain active for more thanyears .
",
8247,0,," removing a landmine can be fairly easy , but detecting them is not .
",
8248,0,," landmines provide a false sense of security .
",
8249,0,," they are often purchased and placed by nations that are fearful of their surrounding neighbours , rather than entering into diplomatic arena to improve relations .
",
8250,0,," they are the symbol of exactly the wrong approach to international affairs .
",
8251,0,," small , underdeveloped countries should channel their efforts into improving their economies -- they should not be encouraged , or frightened by scaremongering , by the usa into buying the usa 's military equipment .
",
8252,0,," it is absurd to suggest that landmines are the prime protector of us forces , or even an important one .
",
8253,0,," it is well known that the principal benefit the usa 's troops , as opposed to those of other nations , have in peacekeeping is the threat of the deployment of overwhelming force if they are defied .
",
8254,0,," landmines are nothing to do with it .
",
8255,0,," us troops have not been pinned down in the way the opposition suggests since world war two , except in iraq : and there , as elsewhere , the damage done to relations with the civilian community would far outweigh any narrow military benefit garnered from landmine deployment .
",
8256,0,," indeed the use of landmines by the us has slowly been changing , sincethe us has only allowed the use of landmines with deactivation mechanisms however it has not actually used landmines in more thanyears .
",
8257,1,,"in syria there have now been almost two years of conflict between the ba’ath party of syrian president bashar al-assad and a fractured arab spring inspired rebellion that incorporates a broad syrian national coalition, kurds and mujahideen from around the middle east.
",
8258,1,," it is now clear that intervention from outside the country, beyond the provision of weapons, will only happen if there is a major change in the situation on the ground.
",
8259,1,," nato and the united states have shown little inclination to intervene in any capacity on their own while russia and china prevent any un action that they believe might be opening the way to overthrowing president assad’s regime.
",
8260,1,,"the united states however says that it does have red lines, which if crossed, will result in more us action.
",
8261,1,," in august obama stated “we have been very clear to the assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.
",
8262,1,,"  that would change my calculus.
",
8263,1,,"  that would change my equation.”
",
8264,1,," chemical weapons are about the last possible line that has yet to be crossed in the brutal civil war where the united nations estimates 60,000 people have died.
",
8265,1,,"there are of course significant difficulties with the use of chemical weapons by the syrian government being a red line that triggers intervention or some other form of reaction; most particularly how do we know when they are used?
",
8266,1,," the use of chemical weapons my not be easy to spot from a satellite, and reports from either side on the ground would be inevitably biased if there are to be such consequences.
",
8267,1,," this question is important because there are accusations that chemical weapons have been used already.
",
8268,1,," the us consul general in istanbul has sent the state department a report that states ""we can't definitely saypercent, but syrian contacts made a compelling case that agentwas used in homs on dec. 23"".
",
8269,1,," the accusation is that a chemical weapon called agentwas used.
",
8270,1,," as chemical weapons go this is not a particularly nasty one; the attack caused five deaths and aboutsevere respiratory, nervous system, and gastrointestinal ailments.
",
8271,1,," the number of deaths however is not particularly relevant if it means stepping over us red lines.
",
8272,1,,"the state department however says “we believe syria's chemical weapons stockpile remains secured by the syrian government” and that they “found no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used” so for the moment we still do not know if chemical weapons have been used or not.
",
8273,1,,"either way the international community must be considering what it will do if it becomes clear that chemical weapons have been used or if they are used more widely.
",
8274,1,," syria is thought to have one of the biggest chemical weapons arsenals in the world and may well also have biological weapons.
",
8275,1,," it probably has large quantities of vx and had before the start of the civil war at least four large chemical weapons production facilities.
",
8276,1,,"if chemical weapons are going to be used, or have been used, should there be intervention?
",
8277,0,," if syria uses , or looks as if it is about to use , chemical weapons then this would be a clear escalation that would require action .
",
8278,0,," syria has never signed the chemical weapons convention but it should be considered to be a part of customary international law so binding even on those who have not signed .
",
8279,0,," the use of chemical weapons would also clearly be an attempt to cause huge numbers of casualties and large scale suffering .
",
8280,0,," inwith the united nations world summit the nations of the world signed up to `` if a state is manifestly failing to protect its populations , the international community must be prepared to take collective action to protect populations . ''
",
8281,0,," so any intervention would be fully justifiable , and indeed should occur as syria would be demonstrating that it is `` failing to protect its populations '' by using chemical weapons on them .
",
8282,0,," there is no doubt that the world has a moral responsibility to prevent atrocities in syria , these atrocities are already happening , but the world can not stand by while the syrian government escalates their scale through the use of chemical weapons .
",
8283,0,," not responding to syrian moves to use chemical weapons will be enabling the syrian government to use chemical weapons .
",
8284,0,," it has already been reported that some chemical weapons are being made ready for use such as the combining of the two chemical precursors , isopropanol and methylphosphony difluoride , needed to weaponize sarin gas .
",
8285,0,," it means that `` physically , they 've gotten to the point where the can load it up on a plane and drop it '' .
",
8286,0,," if there is no response to this then syria will be more likely to use weapons .
",
8287,0,," if there is no response to the limited use of chemical weapons , such as the use of agentin homs , then there the regime will be encouraged to think that there will be no response to larger uses of chemical weapons .
",
8288,0,," syria would slowly escalate to see what it can get away with , an escalation that us officials think could `` lead to a mass-casualty event '' without the appropriate response .
",
8289,0,," one of the reasons why there has not been an intervention in syria already is the difficulty of doing so .
",
8290,0,," preventing or limiting the use of chemical weapons however does represent a defined objective that is smaller , and therefore easier , than bringing peace to syria .
",
8291,0,," it however has to be accepted that if assad 's regime is determined to use chemical weapons then some are likely to get through and how much is prevented is largely dependent on intelligence .
",
8292,0,," interdicting chemical weapons during transport and bombing the storage facilities to make it much more difficult to move the weapons would be easiest to accomplish .
",
8293,0,," but if chemical weapons are about to be used then attacking the delivery vehicles would be necessary ; any intervention would have overwhelming air superiority so would prevent the option of aircraft and helicopters being used to deliver the weapons .
",
8294,0,," more difficult to destroy are ballistic missiles , and particularly artillery but even these are much easier to hit than infantry would be .
",
8295,0,," in the conflict against gaddafi successfully used precision guided weapons to destroy tanks and artillery .
",
8296,0,," moreover an intervening force would not need to destroy every missile and artillery brigade only find those that are being issued with chemical weapons .
",
8297,1,,"we are increasingly warned that there is no single story.
",
8298,1,," narratives are dangerous, and recognition is required on the complex, dynamic experiences, and perspectives, of daily life.
",
8299,1,," this focuses on whether africa’s rising cultural industry provides an opportunity to rewrite africa’s narrative.
",
8300,1,,"the colonial ‘scramble for africa’ embedded images of africa within constructed notions of race.
",
8301,1,," further, contemporary realities characterise africa as a continent trapped, poor, and desperate.
",
8302,1,," jeremy sachs suggests african nations are living within a ‘poverty trap’.
",
8303,1,," media, discourse, and imagery conjure paradoxical images of a society needing ‘saving’ on the one hand, and a barren, deserted land on another hand.
",
8304,1,," stereotypical stories are becoming utilised on a daily basis without critical reflection.
",
8305,1,," as the foucauldian study of discourse shows, power is intrinsically connected to language; thus society.
",
8306,1,,"the cultural industry in africa is now creating a new platform to voice opinion and showcase the daily issues experienced by people in africa.
",
8307,1,," whether through music, film, art, and fashion, there is a rise in african artists who are aim to change global perceptions of africa.
",
8308,1,," nollywood has received increasing attention - a flourishing film industry, nollywood arose as an entrepreneurial project; and has now become a leading low-budget film industry, with the films screened globally and online.
",
8309,1,," nollywood has grown to become nigeria’s second largest employer, and creates an estimated $590mn in annual revenues (moudio, 2013).
",
8310,1,," however, is nollywood changing western perspectives or just an emerging gold mine for the talented and beautiful?
",
8311,1,," kwame nkrumah, former president of ghana, once said “when the music changes, so does the dance”.
",
8312,1,," therefore is nollywood a sign the music is changing for, and in, africa?
",
8313,0,," nollywood is showcasing nigeria 's capability to sustain , build , and finance its own economy .
",
8314,0,," recent estimates suggest aroundfilms are produced weekly , selling between 20,000 to 200,000 units , and creating jobs for around one million individuals , moudio  .
",
8315,0,," the industry is initiating vital development , enabling nigeria to have capital to change perceptions .
",
8316,0,," nollywood is following previous cultural industry paths .
",
8317,0,," hollywood developed from low-budget films , and inthe entertainment industry generated around $ 522bn in revenue , and is continuing to be one of america 's biggest sources of tourism , statista  .
",
8318,0,," in nollywood 's case , the industry is already proving to be of vital importance for regional and domestic tourism .
",
8319,0,," the first film created in nollywood - ` living in bondage ' - raised fundamental issues concerning marriage , wealth and spirituality .
",
8320,0,," the film indicates the need to be aware of cults and what they can drive individuals to do .
",
8321,0,," furthermore films such ` street girls ' and ` mama 's girls ' provide insight into the lives of prostitutes and the sex industry .
",
8322,0,," ` street girls ' is enabling awareness of why girls are forced into prostitution and why they may be forced to commit criminal offences .
",
8323,0,," poverty is identified as a key driving factor .
",
8324,0,," the range of topics covered - from immigration , women , witchcraft , corruption , terrorism , and infrastructure deficits - counteract historic silences in the public sphere .
",
8325,0,," the films are raising awareness to viewers by presenting the stories in a new light - understandable , humorous , and relatable ; and will encourage citizens to demand change .
",
8326,0,," nollywood is showing the limits of believing in a single perspective , the western perspective , to stories on africa .
",
8327,0,," the nollywood industry is providing solutions to pressing issues - including high rates of unemployment .
",
8328,0,," the dynamic industry provides an opportunity for youths to explore interests and invest in their talents and creativity .
",
8329,0,," the recognition gained for nollywood has shown how nigeria 's youths can initiate , and develop , a sustainable industry .
",
8330,0,," rather than seeing the rising young population as a potential threat , the rise of nollywood showcases the talent of the young population and helps overthrow perceptions of africa just being about natural resources .
",
8331,0,," additionally , the growth of nollywood is continuing to encourage individuals to enter the creative industry -- whether to work in production , acting or distribution , the rise of nollywood is creating an entrepreneurial spirit , drive , and motivation to create change .
",
8332,0,," individuals are no longer relying on the government or international community to provide funds , support and infrastructure , but moulding their own futures .
",
8333,0,," nollywood epitomises africa , and life in african spaces .
",
8334,0,," the fast-pace nature of production shows how quickly things changes and everything is on the move .
",
8335,0,," the structure of production shows the dynamic nature of everyday life , action , and flow of ideas .
",
8336,0,," as rem koolhaas '  film documentary - lagos - showed the congestion , informality , and buzz of the city needs to be viewed positively and a sign of entrepreneurialism .
",
8337,0,," the documentary suggested african cities were setting a new trend to be followed by the west , and developing a rising economy .
",
8338,0,," africa is not simply in need of assistance , but rather a fast-pace environment that needs greater understanding .
",
8339,0,," africa is rising and nollywood acts to reinforce this reality .
",
8340,0,," with more films being produced , bigger revenues made , and new investors emerging , nollywood shows africa 's economies are changing , growing , and emerging .
",
8341,0,," interest and collaborative investments being made by the world bank shows the industry will continue to rise .
",
8342,0,," nollywood 's growth provides an alternative to the dominant afro-pessimism .
",
8343,1,,"self-determination is loosely defined as the right of nations or peoples to ""freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development""1.
",
8344,1,," it is common to hear the assertion that this is a ""fundamental human right"".
",
8345,1,," but what exactly does this mean, and is it correct?
",
8346,1,,"self-determination is an issue in many different contexts around the world.
",
8347,1,," many of these involve states which have, through territorial expansion, population shifts, boundary changes, independence from or colonisation of other nations, found themselves in charge of minority groups who may have strong ethnic, national, religious, cultural or linguistic differences from other inhabitants of a nation.
",
8348,1,," this can lead to all sorts of problems; minorities may identify more strongly with a neighbouring state, or fear that their cultural and political identity is being diluted by state policies, while nation states are often concerned about instability or loss of their strong national identity if minority groups are given too much autonomy or special treatment.
",
8349,0,,"so, on balance, is self-determination a universal right that should be available to all peoples, or is it an idea whose time has passed?
",
8350,0,,"many states in the modern world do not respect the rights of minorities or actively seek to dilute and subsume them into the majority culture .
",
8351,0,," others offer limited protections to minority peoples but stop short of allowing them to choose their own futures .
",
8352,0,," we need to reassert their right to self-determination to ensure that these minority cultures are not lost .
",
8353,0,," failure to defend the principle of self-determination now will effectively close off the choices of future generations .
",
8354,0,," for example , australian government policy for many decades was to ignore aboriginal rights , denying them full citizenship1 and removing children from their homes and relocating them with white families , the so-called `` stolen generation ``.
",
8355,0,," as a result many indigenous australians no longer have a strong link to their native cultures and languages .
",
8356,0,," the same is arguably true in places like tibet , where traditional culture is being diluted over time through the deliberate policy of the chinese government .
",
8357,0,," in some contexts , separation may not be a realistic option for minority peoples .
",
8358,0,," however , that does not mean that self-determination is not meaningful for such groups .
",
8359,0,," for indigenous peoples , self-determination may take the form of restitution for land that was stolen from them , or compensation and reparations .
",
8360,0,," furthermore , self-determination may take the form of political autonomy , or greater rights to decide how children are educated , or parallel systems of justice such as sharia courts .
",
8361,0,," self-determination is about representation and identity and choice - not about outcomes .
",
8362,0,," many modern nation states are the product of historical accident or hurried decolonisation processes that did not properly take account of ethnic or religious differences between peoples in the states that resulted .
",
8363,0,," examples can be seen all over the world but especially in asia , africa and the former soviet union , where postcolonial or post-cold war boundaries separate people from their kin against their wills .
",
8364,0,," other territories may be disputed between one or more nation .
",
8365,0,," allowing ethnic or religious groups self-determination may help to reverse the harmful effect of artificial , poorly-drawn borders .
",
8366,0,," if self-determination is universally accepted , and applied , by the international community as a key principle in such disputes , they may in future be easier to resolve .
",
8367,0,," two examples ; kashmir , which straddles the line of partition drawn up by the british when granting independence to india and pakistan in; and the falkland islands , which are the object of dispute between the uk and argentina , including a brief war in.
",
8368,0,," history , law geography all offer competing and incompatible views of who should rightfully own these territories .
",
8369,0,," if we recognise the principle of self-determination as key , however , it is clear that it is the view of the inhabitants that should decide its future .
",
8370,0,," indeed , if this principle is ignored , such disputes will rumble on for many years to come .
",
8371,0,," modern liberal democracy is founded on the idea that people should be free to decide their own leaders and their own futures , but not all states give their minority peoples such a right .
",
8372,0,," however , this is a right guaranteed under international law .
",
8373,0,," the international court of justice has held that this right applies not just to national governments but also people1 .
",
8374,0,," the two important united nations studies on the right to self-determination set out factors of a people that give rise to possession of right to self-determination : a history of independence or self-rule in an identifiable territory , a distinct culture , and a will and capability to regain self-governance2 .
",
8375,0,," if these criteria are in place , such peoples should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangements .
",
8376,1,,"on december 19th, 2008, a ceasefire between israel and gaza, under the control of hamas, ended without renewal, and hamas' al-qassam brigade, amongst other militant groups, increased rocket attacks targeted at israel.
",
8377,1,," on december 27th, 2008, israel launched an air bombing campaign that allegedly targeted militant bases of operations, which killed hundreds of gazan civilians as well.
",
8378,1,," on january 3rd, israel launched a ground invasion of gaza, codenamed operation cast lead.
",
8379,1,," on january 5, idf forces began operating in the densely populated urban centers of gaza.
",
8380,1,,"during the last week of the offensive (fromjanuary), israel mostly hit targets it had damaged previously and struck palestinian rocket-launching units.
",
8381,1,," hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against southern israel, reaching the major cities of beersheba and ashdod for the first time during the conflict.
",
8382,1,," israeli politicians ultimately decided against striking deeper within gaza amidst concerns of higher casualties on both sides and increasing international criticism.
",
8383,1,,"the war ended on january 18, when both israel and hamas called unilateral ceasefires.
",
8384,1,," israel completed its withdrawal on january 21.
",
8385,1,," throughout this period, around the world, newspapers, leaders, and experts expressed opinions for and against israel's military strikes in gaza.
",
8386,1,,"by the end of the 22-day operation, 1,400 palestinians were dead,of which were children, whileisraelis were killed, many of whom were idf soldiers.
",
8387,1,," multiple questions frame the debate: was the military operation necessary and justified as a means of israeli self-defence?
",
8388,1,," was hamas justified in using rocket attacks to get back palestinian prisoners?
",
8389,1,," did israel have no other choice but to launch a large-scale military assault?
",
8390,1,," were diplomatic or economic means available or exhausted?
",
8391,1,," did israel's actions dash the hopes of the israeli-palestinian peace process, or did the operation actually improve these prospects?
",
8392,1,," was the attack on gaza proportional to the rocket strikes?
",
8393,1,,"  is ""proportionality"" a fair criteria?
",
8394,1,," who is to blame for initiating the conflict?
",
8395,1,," was israel's blockade of gaza to blame?
",
8396,1,," or was this a just response to gaza's rocket attacks?
",
8397,1,," does israel have a responsibility to protect gazans because of its a-symmetry of power and resources?
",
8398,0,," the military operations were a legitimate use of the israeli state 's right to defend itself and its citizens : to quote then-president-elect barack obama - `` if somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , i would do everything to stop that , and would expect israel to do the same thing . ''
",
8399,0,,"  prior to israel 's 2008-2009 military operations , hamas had consistently violated the terms of the ceasefire between gaza and israel .
",
8400,0,," it launched a total 6,300 rockets during an agreed hiatus in the confrontation , killingand wounding more than.
",
8401,0,," hamas refused to extend the truce pastdecemberand subsequently resumed attacks , firing nearlymore missiles , rockets and mortars .
",
8402,0,,"  hamas was the first to actually escalate the conflict after the ceasefire expired , with a systematic increase in rocket attacks to a magnitude of hundreds of rockets fired daily in late december .
",
8403,0,,"  the 250,000 israelis who lived in the southern part of the country were under constant threat , often in bomb shelters , and the economy suffered as a result .
",
8404,0,,"  israel went to great lengths to avoid its military escalation .
",
8405,0,," just a few days before israel 's military operations , outgoing israeli prime minister ehud olmert made an appeal on the arab television station al-arabiya asking gaza residents to stop the firing of rockets and mortar shells so that a military response could be avoided .
",
8406,0,,"  this appeal was apparently ignored by hamas and the other militant groups in gaza , and so israel proceeded to respond militarily to remove the capacity of gaza to launch rocket and mortar attacks -- israel was left with no other way to ensure that the inhabitants of the country 's southern regions would not have to live in fear of rocket fire .
",
8407,0,," gaza was also a test case , intended to prove that israel remained a legitimate and authoritative actor in the region .
",
8408,0,," much more was at stake than merely the military outcome of israel 's operation .
",
8409,0,," the issue , rather , was israel 's ability to restore its deterrence power and uphold the principle that its citizens can not be targeted with impunity .
",
8410,0,,"  israel 's military operations were a good tool to fulfill this need for self-defense and did so effectively .
",
8411,0,," the israeli strikes hit their targets precisely enough to do significant damage to hamas forces , both to its leadership and to the tunnels from gaza to egypt that hamas uses to smuggle in weapons and build its growing army .
",
8412,0,,"  doing this damage was necessary as israel could never be safe with a strong terrorist regime in control of gaza .
",
8413,0,," as david harris , executive director for the american jewish committee , argued : `` israel could not tolerate a terrorist regime on its border that was launching repeated rocket and mortar attacks against israeli towns and villages . ''
",
8414,0,,"  therefore there can be no debate that israel had the right to defend itself as well as the right to determine how best to do so .
",
8415,0,," while it is easy for countries and foreigners to state their opinions about israel 's security interests and how its actions may or may not fulfill them , israel 's right to make that judgment itself must be respected .
",
8416,0,," therefore israel 's military operations against gaza were justified as legitimate self defense against hamas and militant aggression which was putting the lives of israeli citizens in jeopardy .
",
8417,0,," as michael oren and yossi klein haleviargue explain , `` the israeli public will not make territorial concessions on the west bank or the golan heights if gaza is allowed to become a neighboring terrorist state that can launch attacks with impunity .
",
8418,0,," israel had already had a bad enough experience letting that happen with hezbollah in southern lebanon . ''
",
8419,0,,"  without the assurance that they will be allowed to protect their homes and families following withdrawal , israelis will rightly perceive a two-state solution as an existential threat .
",
8420,0,," they will continue to share the left-wing vision of coexistence with a peaceful palestinian neighbor in theory , but in reality will heed the right 's warnings of jewish powerlessness .
",
8421,0,,"  meanwhile , the stronger hamas becomes , the more resistance moderate palestinian president mahmoud abbas will face to making any concessions to israel .
",
8422,0,,"  therefore damaging hamas , via operation cast lead , actually aided the peace process in the long run , and was necessary in order to make an eventual two-state peace solution possible .
",
8423,0,," the israeli attacks may also eventually help force hamas to accept a more durable ceasefire .
",
8424,0,," unlike the botched invasion of lebanon in, when israel set itself the unattainable goal of eliminating the military capability of hezbollah , during operation cast lead it was made clear that the objective was not to wipe out hamas , but instead to force the radical group to accept a durable cease-fire on israel 's terms .
",
8425,0,,"  this was necessary as prior to operation cast lead hamas showed no interest in peace , opting instead to pursue its political objectives through the use of terrorism .
",
8426,0,," when hamas came to power in gaza in january, it failed to control the rocket fire from the variety of miltary brigades , including its own al-qassam brigade , into israel and failed to establish internal stability .
",
8427,0,," the widespread violence between fatah and hamas , which ended in june, when hamas took control of gaza and ousted leaders of president mahmoud abbas 's fatah movement , made israel more wary of the security threat an unstable gaza could pose .
",
8428,0,,"  in israel 's view , hamas ' behavior and its reliance on terror tactics will never change if it thinks it can attack with impunity , and so the israeli military operations were necessary and justified in the name of restoring israel 's deterrent and weakening hamas , both of which make long term peace more likely .
",
8429,0,," operation cast lead was justified as it was proportionate to hamas ' rocket attacks against israel .
",
8430,0,," it should be remembered that 250,000 israelis living in the southern part of the country had lived under years of terrorism before operation cast lead was launched , often in bomb shelters , and the economy has suffered .
",
8431,0,," the world 's media may only have paid attention when israel responded to hamas ' barrage , but this does not mean that israel was not already under severe attack by this point .
",
8432,0,,"  moreover , the israeli strikes were rightly measured to disable hamas rocket attacks .
",
8433,0,,"  terror groups fire indiscriminately at innocent israelis and then complain of excessive or disproportionate force when israel fires back .
",
8434,0,," but according to internationally accepted laws of war , israel is permitted to respond with the force necessary to end the conflict .
",
8435,0,,"  israel was legitimate in using full force to win its war on hamas ; israel was under no obligation to restrain itself in what is , on hamas ' own terms , an existential war .
",
8436,0,," provoked by hamas , israel had every right to wage a disproportionate and overwhelming response .
",
8437,0,," hamas has repeatedly stated that its objective is to destroy israel .
",
8438,0,," such an existential threat goes beyond simply hamas ' rocket attacks , as it portends much more destructive attacks in the future .
",
8439,0,," this justifies defensive attacks from israel that go beyond responding merely to the hamas rockets , and would even justify israeli efforts to fully demobilize or destroy hamas .
",
8440,0,,"  in spite of this , israel was actually far more restrained and proportionate than it was obligated to be .
",
8441,0,," israeli precision strikes sought to minimize civilian deaths , as benjamin netanyahu argued : `` in launching precision strikes against hamas rocket launchers , headquarters , weapons depots , smuggling tunnels and training camps , israel is trying to minimize civilian casualties . ''
",
8442,0,,"  unlike hamas , israeli strikes targeted military sites , not civilians .
",
8443,0,," as gary grant argued : `` even if you target your action at military sites , civilians are inevitably going to get killed ... these need to be contrasted with the actions of hamas where every single rocket is designed to attack civilian populations , so every single act of hamas in firing these rockets is clearly an illegal act without any legal justification . ''
",
8444,0,,"  israel may have been justified in acting disproportionately , but instead chose to respond in a proportionate and limited manner which minimized civilian deaths in gaza , and thus the israeli military operations were certainly justified .
",
8445,1,,"during the cold war era, the united states vastly expanded its military capacity; today, the us military vastly outstrips any other military in the world.
",
8446,1,," for the majority of its existence, the american public has favored an isolationist outlook for foreign policy; during the lead-up to world war i, armaments manufacturers were referred to as “merchants of death.”
",
8447,1,," however, the public’s viewpoint dramatically shifted in the second half of the twentieth century due to the perceived threat of communism and nuclear war.
",
8448,1,," since the end of world war ii, the us military has intervened in many conflicts where its claims that the opposition posed a threat to us security have been somewhat dubious- these interventions vary significantly in their level of success.
",
8449,1,," in preparing for the debate, both sides will want to have a general understanding of the major incidences of us intervention in the post-wwii era.
",
8450,1,," interventions after the end of the cold war will of be greater significance because the us’s foreign policy shifted significantly at that time to adjust to a multi-polar world.
",
8451,1,,"debaters may wish to break the debate into two basic categories; morality and pragmatism.
",
8452,1,," on the first issue, debaters should consider whether us unilateral military force could be just.
",
8453,1,," within the category of pragmatism, debaters may further divide the debate into immediate effectiveness and possible alternatives.
",
8454,1,," effectiveness is paramount to the debate, but is a difficult area to evaluate because it is impossible to know what “would” have happened in any particular case if the us had not intervened.
",
8455,1,," consideration of possible alternatives (or lack thereof) is not essential to the debate, but can add substance to both sides.
",
8456,1,," while the pro may simply take a normative stance and argue that us hegemonic power is detrimental, it will be in a much stronger position if it can demonstrate that there is a preferable alternative.
",
8457,0,," conversely, the opp may want to explain why there are no viable alternatives, and why the lack of alternative world police options justifies us military dominance.
",
8458,0,,"the u.s. is an independent nation , not an international entity .
",
8459,0,," thus% of the world population has no voice in its ' government 's decisions .
",
8460,0,," the us government has authority over its own citizens , and it is justified in engaging in war if its citizens are under direct threat .
",
8461,0,," however , citizens of other nations have no means of expressing their opinion in the us government .
",
8462,0,," if the us government abuses its power , these people have no reliable legal means of recourse .
",
8463,0,," consequently , the us government has no authority to intervene in their affairs .
",
8464,0,," a government derives its sovereignty from a social contract with its citizens .
",
8465,0,," citizens surrender some of their freedoms in exchange for government protection ; if a government does not serve its people 's best interests , it is not legitimate .
",
8466,0,," thus in any situation where the interests of the american public are not aligned with those of the global population , the us military can not serve the international community without failing to meet its obligation to its own citizenry .
",
8467,0,," because the american public has the ability to oust a leader that does not promote their interests , the military is much more likely to choose the option of serving american interests .
",
8468,0,," this may not be unreasonable behavior , but it is indicative of the need for other entities - either other nations or international organizations - to have comparable military power to that of the united states .
",
8469,0,," the us military makes problems worse just as often as it makes them better .
",
8470,0,," the us intervened in vietnam on the grounds of protecting the free world from communism ; over 58,000 american soldiers and approximatelymillion vietnamese civilians were killed while the us failed to subdue the vietcong .
",
8471,0,," the united states provided covert support to augusto pinochet after his military coup d’etat over chile 's democratically elected government under salvadore allende because the us feared allende , a socialist , would promote communism.
",
8472,0,," , today , pinochet is remembered as a bloody dictator that ruled through terror foryears .
",
8473,0,," us intervention in somalia in 1992-94 resulted in little more than the loss of american lives .
",
8474,0,," the us experienced similarly negatively results during its intervention in beirut , 1982-84 , grenada  , libya  , and haiti  .
",
8475,0,," more recently , the us has occupied iraq and afghanistan for nearly ten years without brining long-term stability to the region .
",
8476,0,," the united states military needs to step down from its self-assumed role as world police officer because it is not effective and its failed attempts lead to huge civilian casualties .
",
8477,0,," western domination is not the answer to political conflict ; it is the cause of many predicaments that result in the violation of human rights in countries in asia , africa , and the middle east today .
",
8478,0,," former cia analyst michael scheuer , who led the hunt for osama bin laden , wrote in hisbook , imperial hubris , that `` , bin laden , could not have his current - and increasing - level of success if muslims did not believe their faith , brethren , resources , and lands to be under attack by the united states and , more generally , the west .
",
8479,0,," indeed , the united states , and its policies and actions , are bin laden 's only indispensable allies . ''
",
8480,0,," the united states ' unwavering support for israel and its dubious grounds for invading iraq are further source of anger in the arab world .
",
8481,0,," the us justifies its military dominance by arguing that terrorist groups pose a serious threat to american society , and then this military dominance increases support for such terrorist groups .
",
8482,0,," america can not act as the world police because such a system will never lead to peace .
",
8483,0,," the united states spends approximately $trillion annually on its military ; china , the world 's second largest military spender , spends $trillion .
",
8484,0,," the us outpaces other possible peacekeepers by such a large gap that these other powers have little incentive to even try to keep up .
",
8485,0,," unilateral us intervention undermines international actors such as un troops because it communicates the us 's refusal to submit to the interests of the international community .
",
8486,0,," thus us military intervention becomes a `` quick fix '' which prevents genuine long-term stability
",
8487,1,,"the united nations was established inby means of the charter of the united nations.
",
8488,1,," the membership of the organisation currently comprises almost every recognised state in the world.
",
8489,1,," every member state is represented in the general assembly where it holds a single vote.
",
8490,1,," this forum holds debates on any matter within the scope of the charter and passes decisions by a simple majority or exceptionally a two thirds majority of members present and voting.
",
8491,1,," under articleof the charter, the security council has primary responsibility for ""the maintenance of international peace and security"".
",
8492,1,," this mandate includes the authorisation of the use of force for purposes other than self-defence.
",
8493,1,," this body includespermanent members or the p5; the united states, the united kingdom, china, france, and russia.
",
8494,1,," in addition,seats on the security council are held by non-permanent member states that are elected for a term ofyears.
",
8495,1,," although decisions of the security council are made by the affirmative vote ofof themembers, the p5 hold the power of veto over any such decision.
",
8496,0,," proponents of its removal argue that the conditions under which the p5 were granted their veto power are now out-dated and unfair whilst opponents maintain that it is a necessary element in the maintenance of international peace and security.
",
8497,0,,"purported u.n. actions that would clearly antagonise a member of the p5 never even reach the security council ; such is the awareness that the veto would stall its progress .
",
8498,0,," the statistics of the numbers of vetoes passed at any particular point in un history does not reveal the true defect of the institutional arrangement .
",
8499,0,," in an attempt to circumvent this , countries and military alliances are forced to act unilaterally .
",
8500,0,," nato initiated military action against yugoslavia , under the imprimatur of the united states and the united kingdom , without receiving security council authorisation .
",
8501,0,," it had become evident that any un military involvement would be vetoed by both china and russia .
",
8502,0,," furthermore , the silence of the security council whilst russia launched a relentless and brutal campaign against chechnya was deafening .
",
8503,0,," nevertheless , there is little that can be done such is the absolute power of the veto that russia and the other p5 members have .
",
8504,0,," funding contributions to the united nations should directly relate to the influence that member organizations thereafter have on its actions ; with the veto in place , this is no longer the case .
",
8505,0,," the permanent five , as the group of nations granted the most constitutional power in the united nations , should contribute a proportional amount of resources to the institution .
",
8506,0,," initially , this was the case -- however , by, japan was contributingper cent of the un budget , second only to that of the united states  .
",
8507,0,," in third place , contributingper cent , was germany , another state lacking a veto power and any ability to overrule the interests of p5 nations , all bar one of whom contributed less to the un budget  .
",
8508,0,," furthermore , india and brazil , whilst not contributing financially to the degree of japan and germany , have permitted large swathes of their armed forces to join u.n. peacekeeping operations to fulfil the mandates handed down by the security council .
",
8509,0,," despite these financial and military contributions , the states concerned get no greater say in the interests and actions of the organization .
",
8510,0,," a fairer , more equitable model would insist on a greater proportionality between one 's contribution to the united nations and one 's ability to influence its actions .
",
8511,0,,"  blum , ibid all the security council members know that at some point there is going to have to be reform of the council .
",
8512,0,," this will most likely mean more members being admitted to the council .
",
8513,0,," the three countries whose grasp on the security council is tenuous due to their relative power having declined ; uk , france and russia , will likely be willing to give up their veto in order to retain their seats .
",
8514,0,," the united states and china would then have to follow or face the rest of the international community and devalue the united nations .
",
8515,0,," a half-way house would probably be agreed where the veto could be retained in a few areas much as it has been within the european union decision making process .
",
8516,0,," this could then be slowly eroded over time .
",
8517,1,,"the united nations security council (unsc) is one of the main institutions of the united nations.
",
8518,1,," it was created after wwii to maintain international peace and security.
",
8519,1,," based on its founding charter (the united nations charter), it has the power to establish peacekeeping missions, impose international sanctions, and can authorise military action against a sovereign state.
",
8520,1,,"the unsc has fifteen members.
",
8521,1,," there are five permanent (p5) members (china, france, russia, the uk and the usa) wielding veto power, and ten elected non-permanent members with two-year terms, half of whom are replaced each year.
",
8522,1,," these elected members are chosen by the united nations regional groups.
",
8523,1,," the ‘african group’ chooses three members; the ‘latin america and the caribbean group’, the ‘asian group’, and the ‘western european and others’ group choose two members each.
",
8524,1,," the eastern european group chooses one member.
",
8525,1,," finally, the tenth of these members will be an arab country, alternately from the asian or african group.
",
8526,1,,"the european union (eu) is an economic and political union, currently consisting ofmember states, including two permanent members of the unsc: france and the uk.
",
8527,1,," originally, the eu was created mainly for closer economic cooperation, but political goals have been added along the way.
",
8528,1,," one of these political goals is to create a common security and foreign policy.
",
8529,1,," until the end of(when the treaty of lisbon came to effect), one of the three official ‘pillars’ of eu policy was the common security and foreign policy (csfp).
",
8530,1,," the lisbon treaty merged the common foreign and security policy with the work of the european commissioner for external relations and european neighbourhood policy, creating a ‘high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy’.
",
8531,1,," the high representative is in charge of the new european external action service (eeas), a diplomatic service of sorts for the eu.
",
8532,1,," it remains the case that the high representative can only speak for the eu in foreign policy areas where allmember states agree; foreign affairs remains an area where all member states retain a veto.
",
8533,1,,"the european union secured ‘super-observer’ status on the 3rd may 2011.
",
8534,1,," this grants “the delegation of the european union the right to make interventions, as well as the right of reply and the ability to present oral proposals and amendments” in the united nations general assembly.
",
8535,1,,"given the increased activity of the eu in foreign policy areas, the question has arisen whether the eu should get a permanent seat on the unsc, replacing france and the uk who would lose their permanent seats.
",
8536,1,," this case examines the arguments for and against that specific proposal.
",
8537,0,," the united nations is a global body that must represent the whole world .
",
8538,0,," just as democratic governments need to remain representative to be legitimate so the same is true of intergovernmental organisations .
",
8539,0,," if the uk and france hang on to their permanent seats forever , the unsc will lose its legitimacy , as the united nations will no longer be seen to be representative .
",
8540,0,," the result will be an increased risk of war and conflict because the world 's major powers have no legitimate shared arena for discussing their interests .
",
8541,0,," this is exactly what happened to the league of nations after world war i .
",
8542,0,," as many of the most powerful nations , usa , ussr and germany were unwilling to join or barred from joining the league never had much legitimacy .
",
8543,0,," as a result the league was unable to prevent conflicts in manchuria and abyssinia , ethiopia , eventually leading to world war ii .
",
8544,0,," since their interest in a stable world through the legitimacy of the unsc outweighs their interest in a formal veto-power , france and the uk should be willing to give up their veto power .
",
8545,0,," the permanent seats for france and the uk are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of world war ii .
",
8546,0,," however , the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then : france and the uk have declined ; britain 's manufacturing exports dropped from% of world manufacturing exports into% in.
",
8547,0,," and the uk was 6.52 % of the world economy inbut down to 3.56 in.
",
8548,0,," moreover both had large empires which were lost in the decades after.
",
8549,0,," at the same time the eu has emerged as a major player in the international arena .
",
8550,0,," the eu is one of the world 's largest trade blocs , has the world 's largest gdp , and represents almost half a billion people .
",
8551,0,," a permanent seat for the eu would reflect those new power dimensions .
",
8552,0,," the eu might function as an economic union , but its original goal was to prevent war from ever happening again on the european continent .
",
8553,0,," the political resolution of the congress of europe insaid `` it is the urgent duty of the nations of europe to create an economic and political union in order to assure security and social progress ... the creation of a united europe is an essential element in the creation of a united world . ''
",
8554,0,," the economic integration is a means to this goal , by making member states economically too dependent on each other for them to want to declare war on each other .
",
8555,0,," given this history , the eu can contribute a lot of knowledge and experience on how to use ` soft power ' in a foreign policy context .
",
8556,0,," europe has been successful in creating peace on a previously warlike continent .
",
8557,0,," it has also had successes in encouraging reform in the countries of eastern europe and is continuing to do so in the balkans through enlargement .
",
8558,0,," croatia was at war with its neighbors fifteen years ago and part of yugoslavia twenty years ago but will become the 28th member of the eu in.
",
8559,0,," being a member of the unsc would deepen europe 's commitment to international peace-keeping and peace-making missions , something which currently varies very widely between member states , and push them to spend sufficient on equipping their militaries for such missions .
",
8560,0,," the unsc could turn the eu 's soft power outwards to help the world .
",
8561,0,," as a result it should have a seat at the world 's foremost foreign policy institution .
",
8562,0,," in the past the european union has not had the necessary foreign policy bureaucracy and decision making capabilities to be able to control a unsc seat .
",
8563,0,," since the lisbon treaty this has changed .
",
8564,0,," the treaty created a president of the european council , currently herman van rompuy .
",
8565,0,," and a european external action service , eeas , which will eventually have a staff of 5,400 .
",
8566,0,," the eeas is a functionally autonomous eu body with a large number of embassies around the world .
",
8567,0,," this will give the eu representation in most countries ,with ambassadors out of a total of, and the ability to coordinate a foreign policy .
",
8568,0,," a seat at the united nations security council would be a natural extension of this .
",
8569,0,," the most practical way to reform the united nations is for france and britain to give way to a european union seat .
",
8570,0,," although there would inevitably be some loss of influence for both nations the pain would be minimised by retaining one seat between them .
",
8571,0,," the european union often decides what countries get what jobs based upon internal politics , so for example catherine ashton became high representative for foreign and security policy because tony blair did not get the presidency .
",
8572,0,," it would therefore be possible through an internal agreement in the european union to make sure that france and the united kingdom retain control of the unsc seat through having control of the foreign minister post and the post of ambassador to the united nations .
",
8573,1,,"there is only one china, but which is it?
",
8574,1,," there are two chinas, the people’s republic of china and the republic of china (taiwan) but because both accept there is only one china all states need to decide which they recognise as china.
",
8575,1,,"at the end of the second world war there were two main factions in china; the communists (cpc) under mao tse-tung and the nationalists (kmt) of chang kai-shek.
",
8576,1,," these two groups had already been fighting prior to the interruption of their conflict by the japanese invasion of china.
",
8577,1,," despite some cooperation during the second world war the civil war resumed insoon after japan was defeated.
",
8578,1,,"  the communist chinese won several important victories in 1948-9 and captured the kmt capital nanjing.
",
8579,1,," on december 10thchang retreated to the island of taiwan.
",
8580,1,," the cpc lacked the amphibious capacity to invade the island.
",
8581,1,," and in junethe korean war began bringing renewed us interest in asia with the us 7th fleet moving to the taiwan strait making any invasion impossible.
",
8582,1,,"the people’s republic of china was proclaimed on the 1st october 1949; the kmt however made taipei their new capital and refused to give in.
",
8583,1,," the result was therefore two regimes both claiming to be the sole legitimate government of china.
",
8584,1,," both sides claim the entire territory of china, not just that which they occupy.
",
8585,1,," communist countries, along with some non-aligned countries such as india quickly changed their diplomatic recognition to beijing.
",
8586,1,," most western countries however continued to recognise taipei.
",
8587,1,,"this changed in 1971-2 with a sudden thaw in relations between the us and the people’s republic.
",
8588,1,," first secretary of state kissinger and then president nixon travelled to beijing showing that the usa would no longer oppose those who have good relations with the prc helping to precipitate a large number of countries changing their recognition from roc to prc.
",
8589,1,," the united states itself did not change recognition until 1st januaryas a result of lobbying by the ‘taiwan lobby’ and concerns over jeopardising détente with the ussr.
",
8590,1,," since the us change however taiwan has been rapidly losing diplomatic support to the people’s republic.
",
8591,1,,"only three nations in africa currently recognise taiwan: são tomé and príncipe, burkina faso, and swaziland.
",
8592,1,," this is out of a total of twenty-two countries that recognise taiwan all of which are comparatively small states with the biggest being guatemala (in terms of population)and paraguay (in terms of area).
",
8593,1,," but with china playing an increasing role in africa, and the world more generally it is increasingly a question how long the remaining countries will hold out their recognition of taiwan.
",
8594,1,,"n.b. most of these arguments work for any of the countries that recognise taiwan, and indeed it might also be used for a debate about the gambia which has only recently cut ties with taiwan and has yet to fully recognise the prc.
",
8595,1,,"for the purposes of this debate i will use prc, beijing, and chinese for the people’s republic, and roc, taipei, and taiwanese for the republic of china.
",
8596,1,," when “china” is mentioned it is as either the territory, or the dispute.
",
8597,0,," the chinese civil war is over , and it is clear that it is the people 's republic that has won .
",
8598,0,," theconsensus , though the term was coined later , between taiwan and the prc is that there is `` one china , different interpretations '' about who controls that china .
",
8599,0,," if there is only one china then it is clear which of the two china 's that one is .
",
8600,0,," the prc istimes larger than roc , hastimes the population , and its economy is 13.7 times bigger , by purchasing power parity .
",
8601,0,," states should be recognising the prc as the `` one china '' .
",
8602,0,," switching diplomatic recognition to china can be economically beneficial .
",
8603,0,," a country that changes recognition is both likely to be given a reward for the change and then be much capable of engaging in joint economic projects with the prc .
",
8604,0,," malawi for example cut its ties with taiwan at the end of.
",
8605,0,," prc offered a $ 6billion financial package for the defection .
",
8606,0,," malawi has since benefited from large amounts of chinese investment ; chinese companies have been involved in building vital infrastructure such as schools and roads , and even a new parliament building .
",
8607,0,," and trade between china and malawi has been booming with growth of% inalone .
",
8608,0,," even the chinese believe that recognition occurs as a result of the economic incentive the chinese envoy to malawi having been quoted calling malawi beggars .
",
8609,0,," a small african country should not ignore one sixth of the world 's population .
",
8610,0,," to recognise a tiny country of 23million over one of 1.3 billion is being unjust to a huge portion of humanity .
",
8611,0,," when there is such an imbalance in population it is clear that the democratic path is to recognise the side with the greater population .
",
8612,0,," when all the states that have recognised taiwan finally transfer recognition to the prc taiwan may finally recognise that it would be best off returning to china .
",
8613,0,," by changing its recognition são tomé and other small countries can do their bit to ensure peace in east asia .
",
8614,0,," the prc is a member of the united nations security council and as such is one of the key members of the un .
",
8615,0,," it is therefore difficult for countries to avoid dealing with it .
",
8616,0,," the pacific island of tonga 's switched recognition because it feared the prc would veto its membership of the un .
",
8617,0,," são tomé is already a member but that does not mean the prc ca n't cause problems in the international body ; it clearly has the ability to scupper any initiative são tomé wishes to pursue .
",
8618,0,," similarly in other international institutions while the prc does not wield as much power as it does in the un it still has considerably more influence than taiwan ; this includes over some organisations that provide aid such as the world bank and imf .
",
8619,0,," são tomé therefore must deal with the prc , this being the case it should not let recognition get in the way .
",
8620,1,,"the war in the democratic republic of congo has been called ‘africa’s first world war’.
",
8621,1,," dr congo is a vast country in central africa, often mentioned as being ‘the size of western europe’ torn by civil war and subject to repeated intervention by neighbouring states in the period 1997-2003.
",
8622,1,," it has really been a succession of wars with the first congo war being fought to overthrow the dictator mobutu sese seko in 1996/7.
",
8623,1,," a second war involving angola, chad, namibia, zimbabwe, uganda, rwanda, and burundi, as well as possibly sudan, and aboutdifferent armed groups lasted fromto 2003.
",
8624,1,," there have also been several ongoing conflicts that have not yet fully ended; one comparatively minor conflict in the north west at dongo and another in the west in kivu.
",
8625,1,," the total number of deaths was estimated as being at least 3.5 million inwhile init was being reported that the conflict was continuing to kill about 45,000 each month, mostly children.
",
8626,1,,"as a conflict that has been ongoing for such a long time the congolese wars have been a severe test for the united nations and its peacekeeping system as they have clearly failed in either creating, or keeping the peace.
",
8627,1,," the mandate of the un mission has changed more than six times since novemberwhile trying to match political aims with the needs on the ground.
",
8628,1,," the mission now has slightly over000 troops, close to the total authorised inof 22,000, but this force is trying to police a huge area.
",
8629,1,," it also has a diverse mission to provide stability, protection for civilians and to support “the consolidation of state authority throughout the territory”.
",
8630,1,,"it now seems that the united nations may be on the brink of success.
",
8631,1,," peacekeepers usually stand back and attempt to keep the peace, they are not meant to go on the offensive, although they will fight back if fired on, however this changed in early 2013.
",
8632,1,," un security council resolution“decides to extend the mandate of monusco in the drc untilmarch 2014, [to] include an “intervention brigade”… with the responsibility of neutralizing armed groups… and the objective of contributing to reducing the threat posed by armed groups to state authority and civilian security in eastern drc and to make space for stabilization activities”.
",
8633,1,," the un was for the first time to go on the offensive.
",
8634,1,,"now it seems that this might have been a successful strategy.
",
8635,1,," the rebel group that the un and the congolese army were targeting is m23, the biggest remaining rebel force who succeeded in taking the city of goma in november 2012, which the government now claims they have defeated.
",
8636,1,," a government spokesperson has said ""we can say that it's finished.
",
8637,1,," but you never know.
",
8638,1,," those who escaped can come with hit-and-run operations so we have to end everything politically so that we are sure our people can sleep quietly without any threat.""
",
8639,1,," m23 has said that it will now adopt “purely political means” to achieve its goals.
",
8640,1,," this gives the government the opportunity to demand that other groups give up – and threaten to disarm them by force if they don’t.
",
8641,1,,"the us special envoy, russell feingold, says “in a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.”
",
8642,1,," but will it actually be the end?
",
8643,1,," clearly there are more rebels in eastern congo and feingold himself is suggesting that the next target should be the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda (fdlr) and we have seen before that conflict can flare up again in this volatile country.
",
8644,1,,"even if the conflict has been won it can be questioned whether the un mission has been a success.
",
8645,1,," success means more than just defeating a rebellion in battle; it also has to mean creating a sustainable climate that will enable peace to continue and the un mission to be withdrawn.
",
8646,0,,"   the elections process is moving ahead well .
",
8647,0,," while elections can not be said to be an unqualified success there have been two general elections , inand.
",
8648,0,," local media is vibrant and competitive .
",
8649,0,," and there were a large number of candidates .
",
8650,0,," in theelections the observers from the african union and other organisations welcomed `` the successful holding of elections '' and `` the spirit of cooperation and solidarity '' .
",
8651,0,," moreover the whole election process is moving ahead ; the country 's first ever local elections are planned for.
",
8652,0,," this will provide the people with much more say over their daily lives .
",
8653,0,," in a country with little centralised power like the drc local elections are as important as national ones .
",
8654,0,," in a war-torn society monusco helps with disarmament , demobilization and reintegration , ddr .
",
8655,0,," ddr is of crucial importance for the future stability of the drc .
",
8656,0,," they have used the latest technology and decades of un experience with visible success .
",
8657,0,," thousands of ex-combatants have already been returned to their homes and reintegrated into the lives of their communities .
",
8658,0,," by marchalmost 210,000 ex-combatants had been through the demobilisation process -- out of an estimated total of 300-330 ,000 .
",
8659,0,," and almost 32,000 of 39,000 child soldiers had been reunited with their parents .
",
8660,0,," there has been some justice for past crimes .
",
8661,0,," the former warlord thomas lubanga and warlord and politician jean-pierre bemba have both been put on trial in the hague for war crimes .
",
8662,0,," lubanga was found guilty of using child soldiers and given ayear sentence .
",
8663,0,," additionally rebel general laurent nkunda has also been arrested in neighbouring rwanda although there have as yet been no charges against him the government of the drc wishes to extradite him .
",
8664,0,," showing that accountability is being introduced and providing a warning for current militia leaders .
",
8665,0,," with the ceasefire agreement of lusaka in julythe so-called `` africa 's world war '' ended .
",
8666,0,," foreign occupiers , rwanda , uganda , angola , zimbabwe ... , officially removed their troops from the territory under the sovereignty of the democratic republic of the congo , drc .
",
8667,0,," monusco has been involved in the process of peace-building ever since the lusaka agreement .
",
8668,0,," the agreement ended the international element of the fighting leaving just conflicts with rebel militias .
",
8669,0,," this too is now close to being finished .
",
8670,0,," in november a peace deal was signed between the government and m23 in kenya as a result of aggressive un action .
",
8671,0,," with a deal struck with the biggest remaining rebel group drc is close to permanent peace .
",
8672,1,,"the chagos islands are an archipelago ofislands with a total land area of just 60km2 of which the largest, diego garcia makes up 44km2.
",
8673,1,," the islands are a part of the british indian ocean territory which is located south of india approximately half way between africa and indonesia.
",
8674,1,," the islands are therefore a part of the legacy of colonialism as one of few territories still controlled by the uk.
",
8675,1,,"although the chagos islands are not considered ‘non-self-governing territories’ by the united nations special committee on decolonisation the sovereignty of the islands is disputed, and the inhabitants desire a form of self-determination.
",
8676,1,,"the sovereignty dispute over the chagos islands is with mauritius.
",
8677,1,," the chagos islands were ‘discovered’ by the portuguese in the 16th century but were first claimed by the french along with the islands that now make up mauritius.
",
8678,1,," these were ceded to the uk in 1814/15 at the end of the napoleonic wars.
",
8679,1,,"chagos might have become part of mauritius when that country was given independence inbut in the years prior to independence the uk engaged in wheeling and dealing to ensure that did not happen.
",
8680,1,," the uk changed the administrative boundaries and paid off any complaint from mauritius with £3million.
",
8681,1,," mauritius despite this attempt at buying them off have consistently disputed the amputation of the islands.
",
8682,1,," the uk has said that it will cede the islands to mauritius when they are no longer needed for defence.
",
8683,1,,"the people of chagos are the reason why the islands are not a normal case for decolonization as they have been expelled from their home islands.
",
8684,1,," 2,000 islanders were expelled betweenandso that the us military base of diego garcia could be built.
",
8685,1,," there are now believed to be 4-5,000 chagossians, mostly living as citizens of mauritius although some were given british citizenship in 2002.
",
8686,1,," the chagossians have demanded a right to return to the islands and have taken the uk to court.
",
8687,1,," inthe british high court ruled that the islanders should be allowed to return to the outer chagos islands.
",
8688,1,," the government however contested this in the run up to the iraq war.
",
8689,1,," after victories by the chagossians in lower courts the law lords decided bytoin favour of the government in 2008.
",
8690,1,," this was followed inby the european court of human rights ruling it did not have jurisdiction as the uk government had already given compensation.
",
8691,1,," the main hope of the islanders now rests on the permanent court of arbitration where mauritius is contesting the uk government’s decision to turn the islands and surrounding ocean into a marine protected area.
",
8692,1,,"there is likely to be a decision either way at some point in 2014.
",
8693,1,," the agreement between the us and uk for a lease of diego garcia expires inand the deadline to extend or modify it is december 2014.
",
8694,1,," mauritius is determined that “the objective ofis to reassert sovereignty.”
",
8695,0,," the uk should not be controlling territory that is almostmiles away from london .
",
8696,0,," the chagos islands should be under the sovereignty of an indian ocean country like mauritius that is much better placed to look after the interests of the islands .
",
8697,0,," the age when countries had the right to control territory half a world away on the basis of might makes right are long gone .
",
8698,0,," the chagos islands , as with other remnants of colonialism , should be handed over to the nearest state with a good claim .
",
8699,0,," in this case mauritius .
",
8700,0,," the borders of states that gain independence are set by the administrative boundaries that the colony had prior to independence .
",
8701,0,," this prevents any gaps in sovereignty , or any attempt by the coloniser to keep a chunk of the territory , and the conflict this would inevitably bring .
",
8702,0,," general assembly resolutionmade this clear `` any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations . ''
",
8703,0,," this also means that mauritius should have control of the chagos islands which were , up until, a part of mauritius .
",
8704,0,," the most important principle of the international system since the end of the second world war has been self determination ; the right of nations or peoples to `` freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development '' .
",
8705,0,," the uk has staunchly defended the right of self determination in other cases such as the falkland islands about which the foreign secretary , william hague has stated `` we have always been clear that we believe in the rights of the falklands people to determine their own futures and to decide on the path they wish to take .
",
8706,0,," it is only right that , in the twenty-first century , these rights are respected . ''
",
8707,0,," the uk has also said it will accept the result of a referendum in scotland .
",
8708,0,," if areas that are far more important to the uk are allowed their self determination so should the chagossians .
",
8709,0,," the chagos islands have been excluded from almost every human rights treaty from the geneva conventions , iii/iv , the convention against torture , through to the statute of the international criminal court .
",
8710,0,," resulting in what peter sand calls `` a kind of human rights black hole '' which has enabled rendition flights to pass through the base .
",
8711,0,," this is possible because the british government claims they have no permanent inhabitants .
",
8712,0,," sand suggests `` the fiction of the `` unpopulated archipelago '' , staunchly defended by the british foreign and commonwealth office , fco , will inevitably come back to haunt its authors in the very near future '' .
",
8713,0,," with the islands being ` uninhabited ' they are not entitled to an exclusive economic zone under the un law of the sea .
",
8714,0,," britain 's claim to the islands as a whole is also made more tenuous .
",
8715,1,,"ceuta and melilla are two cities in northern africa which have been under spain’s jurisdiction foryears.
",
8716,1,," both cities are exclaves on the mediterranean coastline and share a border with morocco.
",
8717,1,," they are the remnants of a once mighty spanish empire which stretched from morocco to the philippines through much of south america.
",
8718,1,,"neither of these cities were recognised as independent when spain ended its colonial rule of spanish morocco.
",
8719,1,," due to its geographical position, morocco has claimed that ceuta and melilla are part of its territory and should be relinquished by the spanish, a claim which the spanish deny.
",
8720,1,," spain’s position, while initially strong, has been weakened by thefinancial crisis and the decreasing importance of the state in international affairs.
",
8721,0,," morocco has used these circumstances to bring the issue to the fore-front.3       the dispute over the two cities only serves to harm co-operation between morocco and spain .
",
8722,0,," bilateral disagreements have prevented the resolution of other issues and generally heightened diplomatic tensions between these geographically close countries .
",
8723,0,," when the prime minister and king of spain both visited morocco to resolve the perejal crisis and western sahara issues , relations periodically improved .
",
8724,0,," however a subsequent visit by the pm and king to ceuta and melilla inandreversed the progress made due to moroccan outrage1 .
",
8725,0,," if spain ceded these cities to morocco then relations would improve , which could lead to increased co-operation on other issues .
",
8726,0,," 1 , arieff , a. ` morocco : current issues 'junethe spanish possession of ceuta and melilla has resulted in an influx of illegal immigrants .
",
8727,0,," due to their positioning and membership to the eu , the two cities are subject to numerous attempts by immigrants to gain access to europe1 .
",
8728,0,," in melilla this has resulted in a social experiment with dire implications .
",
8729,0,," to discourage illegal immigration , non-moroccans who illicitly gain access to the country will not be permitted to move on from the city .
",
8730,0,," they are trapped in melilla without legal rights and generally live in extremely poor conditions with no means of legal work2 .

",
8734,0,," whilst the spanish refuse to cede their two cities to morocco , they expect the british to return the circumstantially similar gibraltar .
",
8735,0,," gibraltar is a british overseas territory which is located in southern spain , taken from the spanish by an anglo-dutch fleet in.
",
8736,0,," spain asserts a claim to this territory as it was once part of its own lands , despite signing the treaty of utrecht and relinquishing the land ` in perpetuity '.
",
8737,0,," the claim that a state should return exclaves which rightfully belong to the nation which originally owned them is therefore inconsistent with their policy towards ceuta and melilla2 .
",

",
8740,1,,"under colonialism, developed and established countries exerted power over less-developed or newly discovered countries.
",
8741,1,," it was ‘a practice of domination’, and ‘the subjugation of one people to another’, where a dependant territory was politically and economically controlled by the colonial power.
",
8742,1,," many believe that such territories were unashamedly exploited by the colonial powers, both in terms of economic opportunity and the human rights of the native people.
",
8743,1,," colonial powers often attempted to disguise motives by labelling their control of colonies as a ‘civilising mission’, to reconcile the cultural and religious beliefs of the native people with western cultural values of ‘civilisation, commerce, and christianity’, in the words of explorer and missionary david livingstone.
",
8744,1,," however, colonial belief in their own ‘national, racial, and cultural superiority’ meant that the cultures and values of the colonies were often damaged and abused, and colonial powers had little hesitation in exploiting the economic opportunities of the colonies to their own advantage without giving thought to how the colonies themselves would be affected.
",
8745,1,,"            many groups advocate that developed countries should pay reparations to their former colonies, which tend to be less developed.
",
8746,1,," these reparations fall into both an economic and a moral context.
",
8747,1,," in terms of economy, some former colonies claim that colonisation, or even the sudden end of colonisation in the case of japan and korea has damaged their ability to form a stable and flourishing economy disruption of trade, or by seriously damaging and abusing the natural resources available within the former colonies.
",
8748,1,," kwame nkrumah, the ‘first head of an independent ghana’, labelled colonialism as  ‘the policy by which the .
",
8749,1,," colonial power, binds her colonies to herself by political ties with the primary object of promoting her own economic advantages.’
",
8750,1,," in this way, it is perceived that the economic interest of the former colony had been ignored unless it also coincided with the interest of the colonial power.
",
8751,1,,"            in a moral context, some groups argue that former colonial powers should pay reparations for wrongdoings during the time of colonisation.
",
8752,1,," one crucial example of this is the demand that western colonial powers should pay african former colonies up to $777,000billion in reparations for slavery.
",
8753,1,," this is more an argument to repair the historical moral wrongdoing of the colonial power.
",
8754,1,," however in both economic and moral cases reparations present a potential to facilitate development in under-developed countries and the developing world more broadly.
",
8755,1,," particularly in countries such as african nations which suffer from high rates of poverty and high international debt, financial reparations could pose a solution to serious domestic problems.
",
8756,0,," the entire basis for colonisation was predicated on an innate ` understanding ' and judgment of one superior culture and race .
",
8757,0,," this ethnocentric approach idolised western traditions while simultaneously undermining the traditions of the countries which were colonised .
",
8758,0,," for example , during the colonisation of america , colonists imposed a westernised school system on native american children .
",
8759,0,," this denied their right to wear traditional clothing or to speak their native language , and the children were often subject to physical and sexual abuse and forced labour .
",
8760,0,," the cause of this was simply ignorance of culture differences on behalf of the colonists , which was idyllically labelled and disguised as ` the white man 's burden ' .
",
8761,0,," colonial powers undermined the social and property rights of the colonies , using military force to rule if civilians should rebel against colonisation in countries such as india .
",
8762,0,," after indian fighters rebelled against british colonial force in the indian mutiny of 1857-58 , the british struck back with terrible force , and forced the rebels to ` lick up part of the blood ' from the floors of the houses .
",
8763,0,," the actions which occurred during colonisation are considered completely inappropriate and undesirable behaviour in a modern world , and in terms of indigenous rights to culture and to property , as well as human rights more generally .
",
8764,0,," reparations would be a meaningful act of apology for the wrongs which were committed during the past .
",
8765,0,," it is difficult for former colonies to feel as if they can move on and develop a wholly independent identity when their ties to the past , and to their former colonisers , have not been definitively ended .
",
8766,0,," for example , while it is important to remember those who suffered under slavery , the overwhelming memory of it overpowers the history of those countries and innately links them back to former colonial powers .
",
8767,0,," furthermore , many of the problems now faced by former colonies can be traced back to the actions of colonial-era masters , for example the birth of ethnic tensions between minorities in rwanda and burundi .
",
8768,0,," in order to move on from that damaging legacy , and to conclusively prove that such prejudices are always wrong , it is necessary for former colonial powers to show a tangible move towards closing that colonial chapter of their history .
",
8769,0,," in this way they can begin to move towards a fresh , equal and co-operative relationship with the developing countries which were their former colonies , without the background of history which currently warps such relationships .
",
8770,0,," italy 's payment of reparations to libya allowed libya to ` mend fences with the west ' and to improve international relationships .
",
8771,0,," this is a step to recognise developing countries as a nation , rather than an economic opportunity .
",
8772,0,," in this way , reparations would be an effective way of demonstrating a global community and spirit .
",
8773,0,," in the past , dominating global powers have paid reparations and compensation for historical wrongs .
",
8774,0,," for example , germany pays an annual amount of money to israel to recognise wrongs committed against jews during the holocaust , and to recognise the theft of jewish property at this time .
",
8775,0,," these reparations have helped israeli infrastructure enormously , providing ` railways and telephones , dock installations and irrigation plants , whole areas of industry and agriculture ' and contributing to israeli economic security .
",
8776,0,," japan also paid reparations to korea after world war ii as the koreans were ` deprived of their nation and their identity ' .
",
8777,0,," britain has paid compensation to the new zealand maoris for the damage done during colonial times and the seizure of their land , and iraq pays compensation to kuwait for damage done during the invasion and occupation of 1990-91 .
",
8778,0,," there is little reason why other nations should not be paid for the grievances caused to them by domination countries .
",
8779,0,," there is support for the notion that colonial powers should pay for free universal education in africa ; this would be an entirely appropriate and desirable measure .
",
8780,0,," given that much of the motive for colonisation was economic , many former colonies have suffered damage to their natural resources or human resources , which has left them less able to sustain a healthy economy .
",
8781,0,," colonists targeted countries with rich natural resources and little ability to defend themselves from invasion and manipulation .
",
8782,0,," by this method , they could supply their own markets with the natural resources which they had already exploited at home , and find cheap , or free , human labour for their markets .
",
8783,0,," given that powerful countries such as britain and france gained their own economic prosperity through the exploitation of the economic potential of the colonies , it is entirely appropriate and logical that they should pay reparations as compensation .
",
8784,0,," in this way , the economic disparity between former colonies and colonists would be equalised .
",
8785,0,," even alongside the colonial justifications for providing reparations , there are also many other strong reasons why former colonial powers should grant reparations .
",
8786,0,," former colonial powers tend to be economically developed , like america , britain and france .
",
8787,0,," the developed world should recognise the dire poverty and social challenges fed by the developing world today .
",
8788,0,," giving aid as an act of charity can sometimes be seen as derogatory , and is even rejected by the potential recipients .
",
8789,0,," however , reparations allows a transfer of wealth between these countries in a way which is sensitive to the history between them , and which also demonstrates a desire to improve their relationship .
",
8790,0,," it allows aid to be given to the developing world in a means which is dignified but not spurious .
",
8791,1,,"a terrorist organisation is defined by the united nations security council (unsc) as a group which will ‘intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act’ and create a state of ‘terror’.
",
8792,1,," since the 1990s there has been a notable rise in islamic extremism, which led the united states to call for a ‘war on terror’ in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
",
8793,1,," this brought about a concerted effort by the united states to remove terrorist groups from the african continent.
",
8794,1,,"inthe combined joint task force (cjtf) was established, eventually turning into african command (africom).
",
8795,1,," this marked the united states’ largest military presence on the continent since operation restore hope in somalia in 1993.
",
8796,1,," as well as providing direct counter-terrorist military support, africom and the united states agency for international development (usaid) have provided equipment, vehicles, and logistical and training support.
",
8797,1,," this help is to ensure that african states are capable of deterring terrorism within their own lands and ensure stability on the continent.
",
8798,1,,"this is focused around whether or not this assistance has been more of a help or a hindrance for africa in the face of the continent’s major challenges.
",
8799,0,," the united states has one of the most elite and experienced counter-terrorism forces in the world , africa could only benefit from the help they offer .
",
8800,0,," branches of the us military which specialise in counter-terrorism , such as the us navy seals and delta force , receive rigorous training and have gained experience from numerous operations .
",
8801,0,," many african states lack the ability to train and utilise such forces , which is why us help is welcome .
",
8802,0,," us military advisers were sent to uganda to help combat the lord 's resistance army , lra , and assisted with ` an impact disproportionate to its size ' .
",
8803,0,," betweenand, the lra 's attacks were halved and the conflict 's death toll decreased by% .
",
8804,0,," the experience that these forces provide is visibly valuable for africa 's counter-terrorism activities .
",
8805,0,," africa is the least developed continent in the world and will struggle to independently maintain a specialised counter-terrorism force .
",
8806,0,," thirty four of its fifty four states are classed as ` least developed countries ' .
",
8807,0,," the result of poor funding and bad governance is a decreased efficiency of security and military services in these states .
",
8808,0,," in turn , this has resulted in destabilisation of the region .
",
8809,0,," wages , training , and military equipment are expenses which few african countries can afford alone .
",
8810,0,," kenya , for example , had to disband its police reserve unit inas unpaid officers had turned to corruption to ensure a decent wage , despite the need to combat terrorism in the state as shown by the attack on nairobi 's westgate shopping mall .
",
8811,0,," aid from the united states enables these african states to field financially viable forces which can then participate in counter-terrorism .
",
8812,0,," before military aid was cut to egypt in, the us provided $ 1.3 billion annually to support one of the strongest militaries on the continent .
",
8813,0,," the united states is the only significant actor in region which can be relied upon in counter-terrorism issues .
",
8814,0,," due to the `` war on terror '' and a need to maintain a military equipment export industry , the us has been a reliable ally for many african states .
",
8815,0,," the alternatives are less attractive .
",
8816,0,," african nations often dislike their neighbours involving themselves in their affairs , exemplified by the second conflict in the democratic republic of congo -- the great war of africa that drew in nations across the region attempting to secure their own interests .
",
8817,0,," the limited effectiveness of the au 's army has also prevented them from becoming a prominent actor in counter-terrorism .
",
8818,0,," the failure of the au 's measures in sudan duringforced them to appeal to the un for aid .
",
8819,0,," this was effectively an admission of failure , signifying these actors as weak in comparison to the usa .
",
8820,0,," the presence of us military equipment and counter-terrorism forces in africa will result in greater security for the rest of the world .
",
8821,0,," many of the terrorist groups which have existed in the ` ungoverned ' spaces of africa have an international agenda .
",
8822,0,," al-qaeda and other groups have used africa as a base to plan attacks against the west , such as themadrid bombing .
",
8823,0,," the disruption and eradication of these groups is therefore beneficial as it will prevent these groups from acting freely on the international stage .
",
8824,1,,"in 2009, the ugandan government made international headlines when a private members bill was put forward which would have incurred the death penalty or life imprisonment for anyone proven to be homosexual.
",
8825,1,," when uganda passed the bill four years later, with the exception of the death penalty, it served to highlight the prevailing attitudes in many african states towards the issue of homosexuality.
",
8826,1,,"as of 2013,of africa’srecognised sovereign states outlaw homosexuality.
",
8827,1,," while the degrees of enforcement and severity for these laws do vary from state to state, the criminalisation of homosexuality has caused great controversy in the west.
",
8828,1,," the majority of these states will not allow any form of same sex activity, even the possession of homosexual pornography can lead to a prison sentence.
",
8829,1,," international criticism for the outlawing of same-sex relations has seen a notable increase since ugandan member of parliament david bahati proposed his private member’s bill.
",
8830,1,," the obama administration’s opposition to the international criminalisation of homosexuality and britain’s proposals to reduce aid have increased the severity of the issue for many africans.
",
8831,0,," from a moral perspective , it is wrong to discriminate against someone for their sexuality .
",
8832,0,," everyone should have equal rights ; hilary clinton stated that ` gay rights are human rights ' , the derogation of such rights is a serious moral affront .
",
8833,0,," there is evidence that homosexuality is not optional .
",
8834,0,," discriminating on sexual orientation is therefore the same as discriminating upon factors such as race and ethnicity .
",
8835,0,," even if changeable it would be the same as discrimination on the basis of identity or religion .
",
8836,0,," same sex relations are victimless which calls in to question whether it could ever be defined as something to be criminalised .
",
8837,0,," whilst some may point to male on male rape , these figures are low compared to male on female rape .
",
8838,0,," in the u.s. where homosexuality is legal , only% of rape victims were male and only a small proportion of those being male on male .
",
8839,0,," criminalising and institutionally embedding hatred against homosexuality has served to alienate many africans from their families and communities .
",
8840,0,," discrimination on the basis of homosexuality is not something any donor would want to endorse even implicitly it is therefore morally right to cut the aid .
",
8841,0,," if the west did decide to reduce aid to african states it could pressure african states to change their policies on homosexuality .
",
8842,0,," africa is renowned for the dependency on aid .
",
8843,0,," analysts claim that this dependency negates the need for african economies to reform , relying instead on foreign governments and ngos .
",
8844,0,," this reliance on aid could be exploited to alter policy within those african countries that are unable to act economically independently .
",
8845,0,," this policy has been successful in the past .
",
8846,0,," when britain cut # 19m to malawi infor arresting two men for marrying ; there was a reversal of government policy in the african state and all anti-homosexual laws were suspended .
",
8847,0,," the equality created by this policy change would allow greater access to retroviral drugs and other hiv/aids treatment for the gay community .
",
8848,0,," laws outlawing homosexuality , and the stigma of the false connection between hiv and homosexuality , have decreased the accessibility of the gay community to treatment .
",
8849,0,," corrections to these laws , from the economic pressure of aid withdrawal , would allow those with hiv/aids in the gay community to seek help without fear of rejections or prosecution .
",
8850,0,," when western states threaten to cut aid , they are referring to their own money .
",
8851,0,," this money should therefore be spent at the discretion of the donating country .
",
8852,0,," in, the usa 's and uk 's budgets for aid were # 12.2 billion and #billion respectively .
",
8853,0,," the uk 's spending is set to increase to about # 11.3 billion by.
",
8854,0,," this is money which could be spent to ease economic hardships at home , as many newspapers have pointed out , however it is given to other countries to aid them instead .
",
8855,0,," donating states also spend a great deal of time attempting to convince their citizens that giving aid is a good use of their money .
",
8856,0,," should they oppose a policy which they see as discriminatory then it is understandable that they should use their discretion when donating aid .
",
8857,1,,"the united nations security council could be considered to be the highest body in the world; it is the only body with some responsibility, and the capability to act, on security issues anywhere in the world.
",
8858,1,," momentarily, there arepermanent members in the unsc, namely us, china, russia, france and uk who have a veto against any resolution before the unsc.
",
8859,1,," additionally there arenon-permanent members who are chosen on geographic criteria.
",
8860,1,," the african bloc currently has three non-permanent members that are chosen from within the region by elections.
",
8861,1,," non-permanent members however don’t have the power to veto so must rely on building coalitions within the council.
",
8862,1,," as they are rotating no country can ensure they maintain a lasting influence at the unsc level.
",
8863,1,,"the unsc was set up in the wake of the second world war; the veto wielding members are the five main allies who won that war.
",
8864,1,," they also cemented their status by being the first to build nuclear weapons.
",
8865,1,," however by the 1990s germany and japan were, apart from the us, the powers that paid most towards the un and argued this should entitle them to a permanent seat.
",
8866,1,," reform has since been very much on the cards but how, and who should get membership?
",
8867,1,,"the african states have their own views on the issue.
",
8868,1,," inand again inthe african union agreed to support “full representation of africa in the security council means: i. not less than two permanent seats with all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership including the right of veto; ii.
",
8869,1,," five non-permanent seats”.
",
8870,1,," this proposal clearly represents a demand for a much expanded security council.
",
8871,1,," permanent membership with veto is at the heart of their demands – their alternative is abolishing the veto altogether.
",
8872,0,," an african state with veto power in the unsc would have much more leverage to get african positions listened to .
",
8873,0,," this is something that is particularly important as africa is the region that is most commonly on the un agenda .
",
8874,0,," an african permanent member would likely alter the priorities of the council for the better .
",
8875,0,," it would be the first unsc member without nuclear weapons , indeed if it were south africa it would be a state that had given up nuclear weapons so would be in favour of disarmament .
",
8876,0,," there might be more attempts to solve the ` root causes ' of conflicts rather than just providing a response when a conflict breaks out as rwanda promoted as president of the unsc in.
",
8877,0,," an african member might also be more interested in development issues , pushing on climate change etc, it would provide more of a view from the south .
",
8878,0,," africa 's goal is to be fully represented in all the decision-making organs of the un , particularly in the security council , which is the principal decision-making organ of the un in matters relating to international peace and security .
",
8879,0,," inthe majority ,out of, of unsc resolutions concerned africa .
",
8880,0,," beyondalmost% of issues considered are african ; further% of peacekeeping personnel are in africa .
",
8881,0,," the african continent is keen to ensure that their opinion is considered on prospective embargos and military interventions .
",
8882,0,," at the moment african countries are `` preached to rather than consulted as equals '' this must change .
",
8883,0,," the composition of the council is outdated and must adapt to a much-changed world in the 21st century .
",
8884,0,," it is clear that there is growing discontent among african countries regarding the current structure of the unsc .
",
8885,0,," `` we do n't understand why you have three countries out of five countries on the security council as permanent members with a veto coming from europe , '' simbarashe mumbengegwi , zimbabwe 's foreign affairs minister has said .
",
8886,0,," south african minister of international relations and cooperation maite nkoana-mashabane appealed for united nations security council , unsc , reforms and inclusion of africa with at least two permanent seats , he made it clear that south africa expects a unsc seat when reform occurs .
",
8887,0,," the united nations is meant to present sovereign states equally .
",
8888,0,," the current membership was created inwhen there weremember states ; most of them european , now there areof which almost a third are african .
",
8889,0,," on numbers alone in the current unsc africa should have betweenandmembers of which 1-2 should be permanent .
",
8890,0,," the current distribution is selfish reflecting an imperialist past .
",
8891,0,," african countries are not the only ones who wish to have a chair at the p5 table .
",
8892,0,," there are more financially and military prominent countries who also have expressed their desires for having a veto power .
",
8893,0,," among them , the most important are germany and japan who are , the second and third largest contributors to the un budget .
",
8894,0,," offering an african state permanent membership to the un , would likely offend germany and japan .
",
8895,0,," the reason unsc reform has not gone ahead is that all potential members have other powerful countries that would be opposed to their membership .
",
8896,0,," thus for example japan is opposed by china .
",
8897,0,," and the g-4 , japan , india , germany , brazil , are generally opposed by the ` coffee club ' ofmid-size countries led by argentina , pakistan , italy , mexico , south korea and spain .
",
8898,1,,"imperialism casts a long shadow over africa, and much of that shadow is a result of the way the imperial powers drew their borders.
",
8899,1,," lord salisbury famously put it ""we have been engaged in drawing lines upon maps where no white man’s feet have ever trod; we have been giving away mountains and rivers and lakes to each other, only hindered by the small impediment that we never knew exactly where the mountains and rivers and lakes were.""
",
8900,1,," but when the borders had been drawn and agreed they were set; administrators who suggested they should be tweaked to reflect ethnic groupings were rebuffed.
",
8901,1,,"colonial powers could live with artificial borders; they were not too concerned with the comings and goings of the natives and could make sure that no conflict would break out over odd borders that frankly they did not care about.
",
8902,1,," with decolonisation however artificial borders became much more of an issue.
",
8903,1,," london or paris might not have been concerned about african borders but yaoundé and rabat were much more likely to be.
",
8904,1,," borders were not only much closer and have a greater impact on policy but ensuring sovereignty right up to the border was a way of creating a nation state.
",
8905,1,," thus the new leaders were no more inclined to rethink borders than the old.
",
8906,1,," the organisation of african unity (oau) charter highlights a determination “to safeguard… sovereignty and territorial integrity” in the preamble, the purposes, and the principles of the oau.
",
8907,1,," as a result this issue is still an immense problem; the border between togo and ghana alone divides the dagomba, akposso, konkomba and ewe peoples.
",
8908,1,,"ratner suggests that new states should only preserve the status quo on borders until the states can resolve the competing claims so colonial era borders should not be taken as immutable.
",
8909,1,," the assumption then is that there will be changes to the administrative legacy at some point.
",
8910,1,," but this does not address borders that are already half a century old.
",
8911,1,," redefining african borders would seem to imply just redrawing existing borders but in practice doing so while not allowing an opportunity for the creation of new states would be difficult.
",
8912,1,," the proposal therefore would be that current borders are not set; there should be commissions that find the ethnic borders between states and those ethnicities should be able to decide which state they join.
",
8913,1,," where there are strong independence movements this would also be a chance to create new states but the default assumption should be that ethnic groups want to remain in their current state unless this is clearly disputed so as to not mean a chaotic breakup of africa as we know it.
",
8914,0,," imperialism and colonisation is one of the great wrongs of history where much of the globe was carved up without any reference to the facts on the ground .
",
8915,0,," when the west drew borders peoples were split , and kingdoms and cultures carved up .
",
8916,0,," independence may have ended some of the worst aspects of imperialism but it exacerbated the problem of borders .
",
8917,0,," africa has since seen the problems that this has created and should realise the need to break from the colonial legacy .
",
8918,0,," in africa borders are artificial often running through ethnic groupings without consideration for culture or even local geography with the exception of water courses .
",
8919,0,," altering these borders to reflect ethnicities and culture would help states to create their own national identity as their identities would not be split .
",
8920,0,," having the whole of an ethnicity within one state will help prevent misappropriation of culture and history by another state .
",
8921,0,," redrawing borders could help resolve conflict in africa .
",
8922,0,," michalopoulos and papaioannou find `` civil conflict intensity , as reflected in war casualties and duration , is approximately% higher in areas where partitioned ethnicities reside . ''
",
8923,0,," conflict duration is 18.5 % higher .
",
8924,0,," they identify seven different ways in which artificial borders lead to , or intensify conflict ; 1 , partitioning ethnicities creates irredentist demands 2 , partitioning makes an independence movement more likely 3 , when borders are not marked the ethnic group has a reason to attempt to change the border 4 , patronage politics leads to discrimination against minorities 5 , splitting ethnicities encourages smuggling and criminalisation 6 , splitting resources that were previously part of an ethnic group 's homeland will leave the ethnic group trying to engineer the resources return 7 , partitioning reduces development so increases inequality with and resentment towards the center of the state .
",
8925,0,," getting rid of all of these reasons for conflict would help make africa more peaceful in the long run .
",
8926,0,," using data from satellites measuring luminosity michalopoulos and papaioannou find that border areas with partitioned ethnic groups are up to% less developed than those towards the centre of countries so are not artificially split .
",
8927,0,," ethnicity is significant for trade .
",
8928,0,," for example between niger and nigeria prices of millet increase at the border by 23.2 % when it is also the border between ethnicities but only 9.3 % when the same ethnicity is on both sides of the border for cowpea the figures are 20.2 % and 14.4 % .
",
8929,0,," moreover internally where there is an ethnic border between markets there is a similar increase of% for millet and% for cowpea .
",
8930,0,," ethnicity may also affect the ability to gain credit from other traders .
",
8931,0,," it therefore makes sense economically to have borders at ethnic boundaries due to the natural trading relations within an ethnic group .
",
8932,0,," splitting an ethnic group creates unnecessary hardship by making it more difficult to trade .
",
8933,0,," a redrawing of borders would allow for democratic participation in the building of new african states .
",
8934,0,," there would have to be plebiscites in local areas to determine where borders should run and extensive consultation so that the borders are drawn based on the wishes of the people this time .
",
8935,0,," the opposite of what happens at the moment .
",
8936,0,," for example much of the bakassi homeland was ceded by nigeria to cameroon as a result of an international court of justice ruling on the colonial border and many people are asking nigeria to resettle them as they do n't share cameroon 's culture .
",
8937,0,," clearly the people would surely much prefer to have their destiny in their own hands than letting the borders be settled by an international court pouring over 19th century maps .
",
8938,1,,"africa is known as a continent in conflict; it is sometimes called ‘the dark continent’.
",
8939,1,," the creation of an african union standing army would be one way of attempting to create peace on the continent.
",
8940,1,," a standing army is a permanent, often professional, army.
",
8941,1,,"  setting up such a permanent force for the au would be the first permanent force for an international organisation that is not made up of forces seconded from national armies.
",
8942,1,," the au constitutive act does not authorise such a creation but does have objectives of achieving “greater unity and solidarity”, accelerating political integration, promoting peace, and a principle to “establishment of a common defence policy for the african continent”.
",
8943,1,," however as with any international organisation a core principle is “sovereign equality” and “non-interference” this force is primarily going to be about peacekeeping and peace-making.
",
8944,1,," this will be in response to the use of “the right of member states to request intervention from the union in order to restore peace and security” but the union could also “intervene in a member state pursuant to a decision of the assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity”.
",
8945,1,,"the african union has been active in peacekeeping.
",
8946,1,," since the end ofthe au’s peace and security council has had responsibility for maintaining peace in africa.
",
8947,1,," it is the body that decides on interventions by the au.
",
8948,1,," since then the au has been most notably involved in the conflict in somalia but has also been in sudan, burundi and the central african republic.
",
8949,1,," also inthe au decided to create the african standby force.
",
8950,1,," this consists of five regional brigades of slightly overtroops which should be available for rapid deployment anywhere in africa.
",
8951,1,," these however are multinational brigades that remain in their home countries armed forces rather than a permanent au force.
",
8952,1,," it has regularly been delayed so it might seem odd to propose something more ambitious.
",
8953,1,," an au army would however avoid some of the problems associated with this force of coordinating from numerous different forces and ensuring they all remain up to standard by centralising.
",
8954,0,,"*throughout the debate, the following abbreviations have been used:unsc= united nations security councilunga= united nations general assemblyau= african unionwld= western liberal democracies  it is clear that africa can not rely on the international community to solve its conflicts .
",
8955,0,," in order to be more independent , what the african union needs is a standing army , which can intervene whenever there is a crisis .
",
8956,0,," first of all , when looking at statistics , having dipped in the 1990s the number of conflicts is growing once more , the most recent events of mali and the algeria serving as a perfect example  .
",
8957,0,," `` following a year  that signalled hope for a more peaceful development , the number of conflicts increased by nearlypercent ``  .
",
8958,0,," this has served to demonstrate africa 's need for a force to engage in peace keeping and peace making .
",
8959,0,," despite the growing need for peacekeeping forces , there is reason to believe that the help coming from the international community will be insufficient .
",
8960,0,," the dysfunctional structure of the unsc , the body which approves all major international interventions .
",
8961,0,," russia and china , two countries which have a non interventionist approach on foreign policy , have veto power in this body ; which means a lot of possible interventions get vetoed .
",
8962,0,," the examples of syria and sudan prove the inability of the international community to intervene in crisis situations   .
",
8963,0,," the primary purpose of international organisations is to resolve conflicts between members .
",
8964,0,," in the case of the au its first stated objective is `` achieve greater unity and solidarity between the african countries '' .
",
8965,0,," the main threat to this unity as well as peace in the continent is rebel groups and internal conflict .
",
8966,0,," groups for whom the only goal is wealth or to get into power in their own country .
",
8967,0,,"  an au force 's role would therefore be to defeat these armed groups and to engage in peacekeeping .
",
8968,0,," an au force is always going to be better at handling these situations due to its legitimacy in africa .
",
8969,0,," in many african countries , the west is perceived as an imperialist power , due to their colonial past and as a result there is a serious lack of trust between the parties .
",
8970,0,," an au force will also be better than any local force as a peacekeeper as it will , like the un , be seen as being independent while also being african .
",
8971,0,," it would also , like the rebels , be able to cross borders .
",
8972,0,," such a force would therefore be able to hunt down rebels like the lords resistance army which has so far evaded destruction by moving between uganda , southern sudan , and dr congo .
",
8973,0,," countries desire to have influence among the international community .
",
8974,0,," states gain this influence in all sorts of way ; economic wealth , high technology , charismatic leaders , or a military power .
",
8975,0,," having an au standing army would help provide africa with influence ; it would show the unity of the continent and its willingness to work together .
",
8976,0,," a lot of influence is about perception and this is something that an au army can change ; africa will no longer be a continent that can not act for itself even on its own soil but will instead be taking the burden off more established peacekeeping countries .
",
8977,0,," this is an important gain as influence is gained by being able to bring something to the table .
",
8978,0,," having an au force means the au will always be able to bring resources and capabilities when there is a crisis in africa .
",
8979,0,," the default position will no longer be to look to the un , or even to france and the uk for peacekeepers when there is a crisis in africa but to the au itself .
",
8980,0,," but an au army would have other benefits too as the continent would be a better investment opportunity if there is an army guaranteeing security and ensuring peace .
",
8981,0,," the continent 's economic influence may also therefore expand as a result .
",
8982,1,,"balancing peace and justice has been a key moral issue for international criminal law.
",
8983,1,," should individuals always be prosecuted, or can justice be traded away for peace?
",
8984,1,," is it merely a chicken-or-egg scenario, therefore which, if any, has to come first?
",
8985,1,,"the prototypical implementation of the “justice” model is the nuremberg trials following the second world war.
",
8986,1,," leading nazis (as were leading members of the imperial japanese regime, in separate trials held in tokyo) were prosecuted by a court comprised of judges from the allied nations in the war.
",
8987,1,," most tried were convicted, and executed by hanging.
",
8988,1,,"following the collapse of the apartheid regime in south africa, a different route was taken.
",
8989,1,," a truth and reconciliation commission was set up.
",
8990,1,," it provided a manner for those who were accused of human rights violations to seek amnesties if they told the whole truth about their crimes and asked for forgiveness.
",
8991,1,," the commission had members from all sides of the divides in south africa, and was chaired by archbishop desmond tutu.
",
8992,1,,"  the trc is not without its critics, including for those who described it having failed to put criminals on trial.
",
8993,1,," that said, others have claimed that those criticisms exist due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the commissions.
",
8994,1,,"inthe icc prosecutor, fatou bensouda, said the court “cannot take in to consideration the interests of peace, which is the mandate of other institutions, such as the united nations security council” – in other words, that the icc rejects a peace-justice trade, mirroring the general direction of the un.
",
8995,1,,"in 2013, the un general assembly organized a “thematic  role of international criminal justice”, under the presidency of the serbian government.
",
8996,1,," it was boycotted by the usa, canada and jordan, and seen by many as a cheap shot at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia.
",
8997,1,,"peace and justice may mean different things to different people, and different people will have different goals.
",
8998,1,," but is justice necessary in order to maintain a long-lasting peace?
",
8999,0,," by prosecuting perpetrators , justice creates a deterrent .
",
9000,0,," the deterrent effect , as accepted in criminal law generally , is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future -- it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again .
",
9001,0,," if those who committed atrocities ` get away with it ' they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence .
",
9002,0,," the career of laurent nkunda is a good example of this ; he fought in the tutsi group that took control of rwanda inending the genocide and then was a rebel commander in both congolese civil wars in which he was accused of atrocities before launching his own rebellion , only now afteryears as an army commander is he under arrest .
",
9003,0,," clearly nkunda being locked up at some stage would have been better than regularly negotiating with him to try and create peace .
",
9004,0,," it is a fundamental principle of morality that individuals should be held responsible for their crimes -- that is the reason why we , as societies , have criminal law .
",
9005,0,," prosecuting people -- holding them responsible for their crimes -- is a moral imperative .
",
9006,0,," we all wish to live in a society where everyone is equally accountable when they commit crime as one in which not everyone is held to account is fundamentally unjust ; it creates one rule for the powerless and another for those who are ` needed ' to help create peace .
",
9007,0,," this would simply incentivise people to try to make themselves indispensable strongmen -- not a sustainable basis for a peaceful society .
",
9008,0,," by creating a historical record through the investigations and trial proceedings , international justice can create a narrative that helps fight denialism over events in the past .
",
9009,0,," it creates an accepted version of events where both victim and accused have had their say .
",
9010,0,," denialism can be dangerous because it is likely to create perceptions that are likely to make conflict more likely again .
",
9011,0,," for example the post-first world war dolchstoßlegende , stab in the back myth , was used by the political right in germany after wwi implied that the german army had not lost but germany had only done so due to the civilian leadership .
",
9012,0,," this not only encouraged a belief that germany could win in another war but also as the accusation was levelled particularly at socialists and jews helped pave the way for the holocaust .
",
9013,1,,"the international criminal court came in to being inas a permanent court created in order to prosecute the most severe international crimes, including crimes against humanity and genocide.
",
9014,1,," it was intended that it would replace the single-purpose international courts such as the international criminal tribunal for rwanda and the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia.
",
9015,1,,"the rome statute is what the international criminal court derives its powers from.
",
9016,1,," however, as an ordinary international treaty, it does not have universal jurisdiction, it can only prosecute in cases involving nationals of state parties, in cases where the acts took place on the territory of a state party, or when referred by the un security council, which the us has a veto on due to its permanent membership .
",
9017,1,," there arecountries that have ratified the rome statute including all of the european union member states, brazil, canada and japan.
",
9018,1,,"the united states has attempted to “un-sign” the rome statute by declaring it has no intention to ratify the rome statute – something that would require a vote of the us senate, which has been highly hostile to ratification.
",
9019,1,," subsequent us legislation, including the american service-members’ protection act, dubbed the “hague invasion act” by its critics, authorizes the us president to use “all means necessary and appropriate” to remove any americans from the icc – in theory, according to critics of the legislation, even up to invading the hague.
",
9020,1,," israel never signed it in the first place.
",
9021,1,," both countries fear that the icc could be used as a political weapon against them.
",
9022,1,," similarly, israel initially signed the rome statute but subsequently ""unsigned"".
",
9023,1,," israel’s concerns are centred on long-running issues with the palestinians, and the us concerns are based on the prospect of a future us military intervention that they consider justified being subject to prosecution, coupled with doubts over the compatibility of the us constitution, both in terms of national sovereignty and the protections available for defendants such as trial by jury, and rules of evidence.
",
9024,1,,"would it be in the best interests of the global community if the usa and israel were to join the international criminal court?
",
9025,0,,"n.b. see the bibliography for referencesthe international criminal court is a major breakthrough in providing a permanent and durable system that can effectively prosecute and independently try war criminals .
",
9026,0,," in the past there was no permanent framework for dealing with grave breaches of human rights protection , often allowing states to perform evil acts with impunity .
",
9027,0,," only for the very worst atrocities were special courts and tribunals set up .
",
9028,0,," it should also act as a deterrent to future violations ; it may not reduce conflict but will encourage states to keep a tighter rein on their militaries .
",
9029,0,," an attempt at a solution to the problem of enforcement of international criminal law is something to be applauded , for the same reason the criminal law on the domestic sphere is -- it saves lives , protects human rights and provides civilization to what would otherwise be anarchy .
",
9030,0,," domestic legal systems will often suffer from a lack of judicial independence and potentially politicised prosecutions , and are also open to allegations of victors ' justice , or whitewashes by a judiciary biased towards the winners of the conflict .
",
9031,0,," the icc , as an effective court and with an independent judiciary , provide a suitable and unbiased climate for these cases to be heard in .
",
9032,0,," while it is difficult to give any former head of state a fair trial , it is even more so in cases involving states divided along ethnic and political fault lines where any conviction could be seen as one based on continuing hatreds rather than evidence and criminal procedure .
",
9033,0,," it is clearly in the interests of the united states and israel to support the principle that where there is no independent judiciary cases can be moved to a higher level .
",
9034,0,," these states as much as any other desire that those who commit large scale international crimes be brought to book .
",
9035,0,," the icc for example might provide an alternative method of going after terrorists .
",
9036,0,," in addition , the principle of complementarity -- that the icc should only prosecute where states have shown themselves unable or unwilling to prosecute - means that when a state can take effective action against war crimes , there will be no role for the icc .
",
9037,0,," this means that the us and israel with independent judiciaries should have nothing to worry about unless their judiciary proves unwilling to prosecute if one of their own nationals commits a crime prosecutable by the icc .
",
9038,0,," in a democracy the voice of the people should carry weight in determining how the country acts internationally .
",
9039,0,," according to apoll carried out by the chicago council on foreign relations% of the us population are in favour of us participation in the icc .
",
9040,0,," this clearly shows that the us people are unconvinced by the arguments on the theorized drawbacks of the international criminal court and are happy for it to be ratified .
",
9041,1,,"cities have become hubs of innovation, capital, and culture.
",
9042,1,," in 2012, 37% of sub-saharan africa’s population were classified as ‘urban’.
",
9043,1,," with society suggested to be entering a predominantly ‘urban’ age byto what extent are african cities adopting the right approaches to become global players?
",
9044,1,," world cities have been defined as command and control centres of the global economy; and the definition has resulted in the compilation of a hierarchised list of cities.
",
9045,1,," africa has seven cities on the list.
",
9046,1,,"in encouraging the shift to ‘global’ status african governments have adopted multiple tactics, and strategies, to rebuild and redesign african cities.
",
9047,1,," one such approach is forced evictions.
",
9048,1,," forced evictions are permanent, or temporary, evictions which occur without appropriate protection – legal or other.
",
9049,1,," with a desire to remove ‘informal’ structures and the image of ‘unplanned’ cities governments have come to adopt forced evictions as a way to clean up african cities and recreate perceptions of what african cities are, and can do.
",
9050,1,," a lack of data makes it difficult to accurately track the number of forced evictions.
",
9051,1,," however, with the growing desire to hold global events - such as fifa world cup, create aesthetic environments and a sense of ‘organisation’ in african cities, forced evictions have risen across the continent.
",
9052,1,," the growing prevalence of forced evictions has raised debates over human rights, social injustice, and the unsustainable role of planning being used across african cities.
",
9053,1,,"are forced evictions necessary to redefine the position of african cities; are they a natural path of progression; and are they resulting in desired results?
",
9054,0,," western media and institutions often present an image of ` africa ' which fails to understand the reality , and continues to position ` africa ' as the ` other ' , ` unknown ' , and in need of assistance .
",
9055,0,," cities across africa are an opportunity to change this idea of africa .
",
9056,0,," forced evictions enable local , and national , governments to redesign african cities .
",
9057,0,," taking the case of south africa forced evictions , in cities , have been central in promoting its new image .
",
9058,0,," in, south africa hosted the fifa world cup .
",
9059,0,," stadiums were built in johannesburg , cape town , and durban and provided the international community an opportunity to see the beauty of south africa and confirm its ability to deliver as a bric country .
",
9060,0,," evictions occurred to create an aesthetic city , for the greater good .
",
9061,0,," the evictions were only a small cost in the broader scale , whereby a better city would be built for all to enjoy , employment created , and tourists attracted .
",
9062,0,," forced evictions have occurred globally across time , they show the natural progression of development .
",
9063,0,," cases across europe and the usa show evictions were a feature of cities and urbanisation in the past .
",
9064,0,," london experienced numerous ` slum clearances ' from the 18th to the 20th century , one such clearance was the building of the metropolitan railway to the city which destroyed the slums around farringdon and forced relocation of 5-50 ,000 people from 1860-4 .
",
9065,0,," firstly , as modernisation theory shows transition occurs as society progresses from ` traditional ' to an ` age of mass consumption ' .
",
9066,0,," evictions often occur where inhabitants may not have the legal titles to occupy land .
",
9067,0,," evictions enable the transition from communities who occupy land based on traditional laws and beliefs to the emergence of a refined legal system .
",
9068,0,," secondly , development can only progress once new land becomes available - investment requires space .
",
9069,0,," therefore space has to be cleared for the city to be re-planned and new investments made .
",
9070,0,," new investments can ensure african cities become sites of prosperity and continue to attract investors .
",
9071,0,," africa is undergoing rapid urbanisation of 3.5 % per year , by comparison china 's is only 2.3 % .
",
9072,0,," with the rising number of ` megacities ' across africa , the government need to introduce methods to control the sprawling nature of cities and create a sense of order .
",
9073,0,," mega , and million , cities have become a representation of africa 's urban future .
",
9074,0,," urbanisation in africa is occurring much faster than the governments are able to cope with .
",
9075,0,," as mike davis  suggests african nations showcase a new type of city - a city of slums , decay , and prevailing revolution .
",
9076,0,," the government need to take more control to effectively build future cities and define the path of urbanisation .
",
9077,0,," slums and informal settlements need upgrading ; and the percentage of slums remains highest in sub-saharan africa where slums can be up to% of the urban population .
",
9078,0,," slums are unhealthy spaces - spaces where disease festers , there is limited access to sanitation and services , and overcrowding presents a squalid environment .
",
9079,0,," forced evictions are an effective urban planning tool to build healthier cities .
",
9080,0,," residents need to be evicted to enable infrastructure to be built , i.e. roads , lighting , sewage , and services constructed , i.e. hospitals and schools .
",
9081,0,," evictions enable a healthier environment and homes to be built in the process of redevelopment , beneficial for inhabitants in the long-run .
",
9082,0,," this has been the motive of kenya visionwhich aims to provide access to adequate housing and a secure environment for urban dwellers .
",
9083,0,," in upgrading slums , such as kibera , the first stage required relocating residents in kibera to multiple sites , i.e. soweto east .
",
9084,0,," a key character of global cities are the global connections made .
",
9085,0,," whether financial , economic , political , or cultural - global cities become a fundamental hub providing key resources .
",
9086,0,," forced evictions provide space in overcrowded , unorganised , cities whereby new architecture and districts can be built , and new trends set .
",
9087,0,," forced evictions provide spaces for new financial districts and beautiful cities to emerge across africa .
",
9088,0,," recently plans have been set to implement ` eco ' projects across african cities .
",
9089,0,," proposed projects include the konza techno city , nairobi ; eko atlantic , lagos ; hope , ghana ; and kampala tower , kampala , as part of the venus project .
",
9090,1,,"a key debate being raised within urban studies internationally includes the power land titling can have to reduce poverty and empower individuals.
",
9091,1,," formal land titles are defined as legal rights attached to property by the state; they represent a means of legal land tenure.
",
9092,1,," the possession of land titles is suggested to put individuals on the map: enabling the ability to demand services and rights, and providing an opportunity to enter markets and invest.
",
9093,1,," however, what are the real benefits of granting land titles; and what happens when individuals are included under persisting inequalities?
",
9094,1,,"the provision of land titling has recently shifted to include women.
",
9095,1,," in promoting the rights of women, action is being taken to grant land titles to women, globally.
",
9096,1,," two programme streams have been introduced - joint-titling, whereby the land title indicates shared ownership between partners, and female ownership, meaning women can be recognised as the legal title holder.
",
9097,1,," across africa data shows 67% of countries have equal gender property rights, while no countries have equal inheritance rights.
",
9098,1,,"this focuses on what type of ‘empowerment’ is provided for women through formal land titles in the african context, and the extent changing the rules of land tenure should be used as a means of ‘empowerment’.
",
9099,1,," the focus is placed on the power of the title deed, having ones name formally recognised as owner/co-owner, which may be gained through payment, inheritance and/or land transfers.
",
9100,1,," as programmes continue to be rolled out is the provision of land titles can land titles enable women to become equal citizens; justify rights; and enable social security?
",
9101,0,," land titles mean women will be recognised as citizens , with rights .
",
9102,0,," women will be included in the system of justice and their rights to occupy , build , and use , land , recognised .
",
9103,0,," titles will provide bottom-up empowerment .
",
9104,0,," a physical and psychological sense of security will be provided ; and a sense of social belonging , and place , is enabled .
",
9105,0,," legal security has benefits for health , mental and physical , and reduces risk .
",
9106,0,," for example , access to titles will reduce the vulnerability of women to ` property grabbing ' .
",
9107,0,," in the case of ethiopia , the introduction of joint land-titling and household registration inhas been shown to have changed women 's perception of tenure security .
",
9108,0,," previously , the prevalence of polygamous relationships meant only the first wife was granted legal rights and recognition , leaving other wives and households without rights to land .
",
9109,0,," the provision of land titles ensures women equal security within a legal framework .
",
9110,0,," women are entitled to rights ; and titles provide the security to use the legal system .
",
9111,0,," due to a lack of access to formal titling women have been pushed into acquiring , and living in , slums .
",
9112,0,," land titling programmes benefit slum dwellers and inhabitants living in informal housing across african cities .
",
9113,0,," titles for women mean a sense of security to inhabit space is provided ; and women will be encouraged to invest in their land .
",
9114,0,," titling provision has resulted in slum upgrading , investing in changing the structure of urban africa .
",
9115,0,," second , being recognised as title holders means women are able to demand new services - such as access to water , sanitation , and lights .
",
9116,0,," such demand will ensure improved health for women .
",
9117,0,," women are able to use the law to interact with the state and change their future by demanding crucial services .
",
9118,0,," access to titles is a means of poverty alleviation for female-headed households and women .
",
9119,0,," having recognised land rights means first , their land becomes exchangeable and profits can be gained through different strategies .
",
9120,0,," second , women are able to access credit and finance with the granting of a formal land title .
",
9121,0,," women are able to become entrepreneurs establishing businesses , agricultural cultivation , and the ability to sell property and land .
",
9122,0,," such investments have positive benefits for the whole economy .
",
9123,0,," for example by encouraging crop cultivation to small-scale farmers food security can be provided , and the agrarian market revitalised .
",
9124,0,," in the case of ethiopia , the economy remains highly dependent on agricultural production .
",
9125,0,," the security land titles provides has encouraged agricultural cultivation to women nationwide .
",
9126,0,," women are able to build a new food market and earn an income to sustain their livelihoods .
",
9127,0,," one of the main forms of gender-based violence includes violent acts carried out by husbands or partners .
",
9128,0,," evidence shows the provision of land titles reduce risks to female health and vulnerabilities to violence .
",
9129,0,," women become accepted as , and confident , decision makers within their homes as titling redistributes power within households .
",
9130,0,," furthermore possessing a land title enables safer sexual relations by offering legal protection .
",
9131,0,," research in kenya has shown titles will reduce the risk of spreading hiv/aids and rape .
",
9132,0,," due to gender norms widows are forced into traditional ` cleansing ' rituals , rape and forced marriage , in order to hold onto physical assets and inherit their rightful land from in-laws .
",
9133,0,," land titles are therefore a means of tackling gender discrimination and providing freedom of choice on how women can act .
",
9134,0,," women are less likely to be forced into unsafe sex , following the death of their husband or divorce , to occupy the land .
",
9135,0,," additionally , returning to the case of kenya , fida have reported how a woman 's choice to divorce her partner often leaves many property-less .
",
9136,0,," women may be more likely to remain in an unhappy , dangerous , marriage without changes in property legal systems .
",
9137,0,," giving women the right to land will provide the path for gender equality in the present and future .
",
9138,0,," girls will be granted equal access rights to family land and inheritance in the future , and decisions around marriage dowry can be changed .
",
9139,1,,"first and foremost, it is necessary to give a clear definition of the concept of civil society.
",
9140,1,," it can be understood as ‘the population of groups formed for collective purposes primarily outside of the state and marketplace’ (van rooy, 1998: 30).
",
9141,1,," such groups are based on solidarity networks, and on ‘cross-cut vertical ties of kinship and patronage’ (lewis, 2002: 570).
",
9142,1,,"the importance of civil society, and the role it should play in countries’ political life, are widely debated issues.
",
9143,1,," some scholars such as mcfaul go as far as to argue that democracy can never come into being without an active civil society.
",
9144,1,," others, while recognizing its importance, argue that civil society alone cannot bring about actual changes in the country’s political life, without a decision on the part of the elites.
",
9145,1,," indeed, it can be argued that an excessively active civil society is dangerous for political stability.
",
9146,1,," besides democracy, the development and involvement of civil society in the political life is often seen as beneficial for economic development.
",
9147,1,,"the issue, however, remains controversial.
",
9148,1,," many underline that the idea of civil society’s involvement being positive for political life has been developed in the context of a western-centric literature.
",
9149,1,," indeed, the concept itself of civil society has its roots in western european experiences.
",
9150,1,," furthermore, as highlighted before, scholars do not even agree that csos play a positive role in western contexts.
",
9151,1,," the purpose of this debate is to understand how the concept of civil society adapts to the african context, and specify the pros and cons of a wider involvement of societal actors in african political life.
",
9152,1,,"  are there african specificities that justify a limited involvement of civil society in the political life?
",
9153,1,," or, on the contrary, should we consider the western example and advocate for a wider participation of societal actors in politics?
",
9154,0,," the involvement of civil society in political life is all the more crucial in africa , where newborn democracies need to be strengthened and consolidated .
",
9155,0,," active csos function as a watchdog for political power and as alternative channels for citizens ' political participation , thus strengthening democratic accountability .
",
9156,0,," indeed , several scholars highlight that a ` prostrate civil society ' is to be identified as a fundamental factor in determining the region 's democratic instability , scott  as quoted in lewis ,:.
",
9157,0,," ` civil society is a hitherto , missing key , to sustained political reform , legitimate states and governments , improved governance , viable state-society and state-economy relations , and prevention of the kind of political decay that undermined new african governments a generation ago ' , harberson ,: 1-2 .
",
9158,0,," the sustainability of african democracies thus depends on the promotion of a more active and participative civil society .
",
9159,0,," there is increasing evidence that a more active and involved civil society is good for economic development .
",
9160,0,," specifically , csos are believed to have a crucial role for african development prospects .
",
9161,0,," the local economic development network of africa argues that ` in particular , they often know what are the employment and income generation needs of different groups within the population and what could stimulate better outcomes for them .
",
9162,0,," it is very important , therefore , that they are involved and consulted '  .
",
9163,0,," in addition csos autonomously implement development programmes .
",
9164,0,," only to give an example , in nepal csos in the education for income generation program have played a crucial role in building up workers skills resulting in% being in employment many striking out entrepreneurially on their own5 .
",
9165,0,," it is therefore necessary for african governments to guarantee such organizations and grant them a wider participation .
",
9166,0,," former un secretary-general kofi annan has stated that ` good governance is perhaps the single most important factor in eradicating poverty and promoting development ' .
",
9167,0,," it is therefore impossible to ignore the claim that csos involvement in political life is crucial to promote good governance practices .
",
9168,0,," civil society is able to create additional pressure on the government to ensure good governance , as well as to contribute ideas about what good governance practices should entail in the specific local context , and to ` bridge the gap between the law and its actual implementation '  .
",
9169,0,," `` good governance in africa is ultimately going to come from civil society in the countries themselves '' , declared jendayi frazer , former u.s. assistant secretary of state for african affairs .
",
9170,0,," an article in the guardian shows how cso 's can help : ` in the ileje district of southern tanzania , expectant mothers about to give birth had to cross a crocodile-infested river into malawi because a local medical centre did not have enough money to pay for a midwife .
",
9171,0,," it took a campaign by civil society organisations and citizens to uncover that there was money available , but that it had somehow been diverted ' .
",
9172,0,," csos involvement ultimately permitted the solution of the issue .
",
9173,1,,"african nations played a key role in the genesis of the international criminal court – indeed, the first state to ratify the rome statute was senegal.
",
9174,1,,"  five icc judges, including the vice president, sanji mmasenono monageng (who is from botswana), are african, as is the current prosecutor, fatou bensouda (from the gambia).
",
9175,1,,"however, a chorus of disapproval has grown from members of the african union (a grouping of the vast majority of african states) following a number of controversial indictments of african leaders.
",
9176,1,," omar al bashir, president of sudan is indicted by the icc for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, but has not been captured for trial despite visiting a number of icc member states, including some african states who have simply refused to hand him over.
",
9177,1,," more recently, things came to a head over the icc’s actions against the sitting president and vice president of kenya, uhuru kenyatta and william ruto, over allegations of crimes against humanity in violence that followed on from the disputedpresidential election.
",
9178,1,,"the idea of an african criminal court is not new, and was first mooted in 2004.
",
9179,1,," in 2012, it was planned that the african court of justice and african court on human and people’s rights , two courts run by the african union that not all states have signed up to and have a low case load, merge in to one court which would also try criminal cases.
",
9180,1,," however, few countries have signed or ratified the appropriate treaties and the courts being merged get little, if any, use.
",
9181,1,," this has not yet materialized.
",
9182,1,,"a regional criminal court could cover either the three varieties of crime covered by the icc – genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity – or a broader pool, possibly including drug trafficking, coups and/or  corruption.
",
9183,0,," all of the ongoing icc prosecutions are based on events in africa , and all those on trial are africans .
",
9184,0,," the icc has not brought actions following the invasion of iraq , or the conflicts in sri lanka and colombia .
",
9185,0,," the lack of action in any matter outside sub-saharan africa shows that the international community are happy to allow the icc to exclusively prosecute africans .
",
9186,0,," the un security council , which contains no african permanent members , can veto any possible prosecution and refer a case to the icc , replacing the icc with an african criminal court would stop this bias , or perception of bias .
",
9187,0,," this would be done by withdrawing from the rome statute and the icc which has been labelled as western imperialism by people such as rwandan president paul kagame .
",
9188,0,," a regional court would be a good way to balance the competing issues between the legitimate concerns of the african states and the international criminal court .
",
9189,0,," it would be able to provide an african solution to african problems , with no accusations of external interference or colonialism .
",
9190,0,," similarly , it would have some of the advantages of the icc particularly its independence from individual states , meaning those in high places are more likely to be held to account .
",
9191,0,," with this accountability to an african court there would be an impression of being held to account by peers not outsiders .
",
9192,0,," the balance between peace and justice is a complex issue .
",
9193,0,," the icc has disregarded peace as a priority in cases , focusing exclusively on justice by indicting individuals , which reduces the diplomatic leeway and drives those indicted towards a bunker mentality .
",
9194,0,," the result then may be the conflict goes on longer and more crimes are committed .
",
9195,0,," peace and preventing future crimes should come before justice for past crimes .
",
9196,0,," the icc have focused on prosecuting omar al bashir , but it may be a better option to focus on diplomatic alternatives to trials for dealing with the conflict in darfur .
",
9197,0,," it has been suggested that offences such as `` unconstitutional change of government '' , drug trafficking , piracy and corruption should be added to the jurisdiction of an african criminal court .
",
9198,0,," the icc is limited to only a small number of crimes .
",
9199,0,," however , an african criminal court could not only deal with the existing crimes , but create pan-african solutions in terms of dealing with a number of issues where africa needs particular solutions .
",
9200,0,," an acc could deal with piracy off the coast of east africa , where there is no effective court system , due to somalia amounting to a failed state .
",
9201,0,," similarly , `` unconstitutional change of government '' prosecutions could amount to a deterrent to coups .
",
9202,1,,"in 2007, after the announcement of the party of national unity’s mwai kibaki as winner of the kenyan presidential election, supporters of the orange democratic movement’s raila odinga contested the results.
",
9203,1,," violence stemming from protests, largely along ethnic lines, caused 1,500 deaths and 600,000 displacements.
",
9204,1,," the kenyan government launched the waki commission, which recommended a special tribunal, which was politically rejected in kenya, leading to the commission to send evidence to the icc.
",
9205,1,," six people were indicted by the icc in 2011, including william ruto and uhuru kenyatta.
",
9206,1,,"the allegations against william samoei ruto and another defendant, joshua arap sang, is that they sought to ethnically cleanse the kikuyu, kamba and kisii racial groups, who were seen as pro-pnu, from certain areas – sang, a radio presenter, using his show to incite violence.
",
9207,1,," their trial commenced on the 10th of september 2013.
",
9208,1,," the allegations against uhuru kenyatta are that he funded a banned gang, in order to keep the pnu in power at all costs, leading to deaths of civilians, rapes and ethnic cleansing.
",
9209,1,,"despite this, in april 2013, kenyatta and ruto were elected as president and vice president of kenya respectively.
",
9210,1,," in september 2013, al-shabaab, a somali based islamist terror group, preformed a gun and grenade attack on the westgate shopping centre in nairobi, leading todeaths.
",
9211,1,," the need for a response lead to an upsurge in sympathy and support with the kenyan government, and strengthened calls for the trials of ruto, which was already underway, and kenyatta, which was due to start, to be postponed.
",
9212,1,,"the kenyan government, with support from the african union, is attempting to stop the trial from going ahead.
",
9213,1,," the trial of ruto commenced in september 2013, with the kenyatta trial scheduled to start on february 2014, following delays to allow kenyatta to govern in response to the westgate massacre.
",
9214,1,,"should the icc hold off prosecuting kenyatta and ruto until their terms as president and deputy president respectively end in 2018?
",
9215,1,," kenyatta and ruto could be re-elected for further five year terms.
",
9216,0,," kenya is at risk of terrorist attack .
",
9217,0,," al-shabab , a group linked to al qaeda have launched a number of attacks against kenya .
",
9218,0,," in addition to the westgate massacre , there have been grenade attacks on bus terminals and suicide bombings in refugee camps .
",
9219,0,," kenya 's waters are also used by somali based pirates as a ground for attacks on international shipping , including possibly targeting ships travelling towards the port of mombasa .
",
9220,0,," it is more important to the international community to have credible action taken in order to protect the kenyan people from terrorism .
",
9221,0,," this needs a strong kenyan government -- which means that there can not be a change due to an international trial .
",
9222,0,," traditionally , heads of state have had immunity in foreign courts .
",
9223,0,," this is for the normal functioning of diplomacy -- so heads of state can engage in business at other states and travel to summits without the risk of harassment by vexatious claims in foreign courts , or foreign governments trying to attack the decisions of other governments in their own courts .
",
9224,0,," the icc trying sitting heads of state would set a terrible precedent of a method of regime change -- not even by foreign militaries , but by the icc prosecutor .
",
9225,0,," regimes should change according to democratic mandate not foreign courts .
",
9226,0,," unlike many of the other icc defendants , uhuru kenyatta and william ruto have a democratic mandate from elections that `` represented the will of the voters '' -- electoral mandates given to them after their indictment by the international criminal court .
",
9227,0,," this must be respected by the icc and the international community as a whole : even though they are suspected of crimes against humanity by a foreign court .
",
9228,1,,"the european union has been since its foundation been a hybrid between an intergovernmental organization (igo) and supranational federation (sf).
",
9229,1,," one of the most notable differences between these two establishments is in the ‘attitude’ towards their member states.
",
9230,1,," while igo honors members’ sovereignty, sf puts forward collective spirit (in terms of rule of majority).
",
9231,1,," these are also best represented by preferred voting procedures – igo uses unanimity requirement and sf the vote of majority (currently, eu exercises qualified majority voting – in areas such as education, environment and economic and monetary policy implementation [1] [2]).
",
9232,1,,"the unanimity requirement (effectively a veto power) is set as a default voting procedure for the most important issues dealt with in the eu (these are, for instance, taxation, social security and social protection, foreign and common defence policy) [3].
",
9233,1,," however, its usage is being restricted in favor of qualified majority voting, with the treaty of lisbon introducing the most recent reductions.
",
9234,1,," the opinions about the usefulness (or harmfulness) of the unanimity requirement greatly differ.
",
9235,1,," intergovernmentalists believe that the requirement is enormously important to preserve the sovereign nature of the culturally different members of the eu.
",
9236,1,," on the other hand, supranationalists argue that it is exactly because of these vast differences that the unanimity principle hinders the eu.
",
9237,1,,"the movement away from the unanimity requirement (notable in the recent years – treaty of lisbon changedcases of unanimity requirement to qualified majority voting; for instance legal immigration, europol, energy security and emergency humanitarian aid to hot-spots around the globe, the eu budget [4]) might have suggested that it is supranationalists that are correct, but looking at the recent development in the eu-uk relationship it is safe to conclude that any further ‘federalization’ may well cause great britain’s to leave the eu.
",
9238,1,," worries that similar scenarios, where attempts for further federalization would cause greater exclusion of multiple other members (such as france, ireland – which both rejected the constitution - or hungary) are justified, and cast grave concerns over the theory that the current situation of the eu could be improved, and in the future prevented by closer federalization.
",
9239,1,,"however, what is there left for the eu in its current state?
",
9240,1,," it is indisputable that the greek crisis, caused by lack of fiscal discipline and lack of institutional tools looking out for potential threats, very negatively affected the whole eu.
",
9241,1,," is this not a sufficient reason to state that, at least in the monetary union, where problems of one greatly impact all the others, the individual member states are not self-conscious enough to take up on such huge responsibility?
",
9242,1,," in 2012, not a single eurozone country met the maastricht criteria (including stable exchange rate, inflation under 1.5%, 3% budget deficit, 60% state debt and low long-term interest rates / see source) [5] that very criteria deemed to judge nation’s ability to adopt euro.
",
9243,1,," not sticking to the conditions of membership is now more of a norm than an exception, and allowing the vetoing of decisions attempting to enforce adherence to the rules – such as the maastricht criteria – may well only worsen the situation.
",
9244,1,,"with the complexity of the problem there are hardly any simple solutions to be found.
",
9245,1,," good or bad options no longer exist for it is inevitable that with every action taken, there will be repercussions to be dealt with.
",
9246,1,," understandably, the focus should be on the long-term prosperity which often causes short-term hardship, making it politically extremely unpopular.
",
9247,1,," thus the question arises – will the leaders find the will to look the beast right into the eyes, and take it by horns; is getting rid of the unanimity requirement the only way to do it?

",
9251,0,,"european union has been based on principles of solidarity and mutual help .
",
9252,0,," this means that sometimes , in order to ensure the ` greater good ' , one has to forgo a bit of his own self-interest .
",
9253,0,," because european union holds togetherculturally and economically different countries , qualified majority voting is sufficient to ensure that no state will be harmed by the decisions made on the international level .
",
9254,0,," the fact that some states would like to retain their right of veto undermines the basic principles of the eu because no such process , where a single state is able to prevent majority from adopting a measure can be called democratic .
",
9255,0,," it this system the minority , or individual state , can ignore the will of the majority indefinitely .
",
9256,0,," moreover , zamora , in sieberson  states that `` international agreement is impossible to obtain when any single participant can block a decision ; to achieve unanimous consent ... a decision must be diluted so as to please everyone , '' concluding that such result is unsatisfactory and prohibits effective functioning of an international organization , mainly in regards to urgent , practical problems .
",
9257,0,," unanimous voting provides states seeking additional gains with a tool to actually achieve their egoistic goals .
",
9258,0,," in order for the whole union to pass legislation that would be beneficial to all , a single state has power to negotiate further benefits for itself , thus holding up a deal and sometimes making it less beneficial for others .
",
9259,0,," similar concerns were expressed in the eu commission white paper on european governance as consensus requirement `` often holds policy-making hostage to national interest '' .
",
9260,0,," what is more , such behavior sets dangerous precedents that nations can put national interests in front of communal , effectively deteriorating the cooperative spirit of the eu and eventually destroying it altogether .
",
9261,0,," as sieberson claims , such was the case of french objections to the treaty of rome regarding the wider use of qualified majority voting in the fields of agriculture and the internal market .
",
9262,0,," in the ` empty chair crisis ' france boycotted council meetings for seven months , until the deal called luxembourg accord was struck .
",
9263,0,," `` the luxembourg accord is widely believed to have created a period of stagnation in the community ... paul craig describes this period as `` the prime example of negative intergovernmentalism . ''
",
9264,0,," it prevented consolidation of europe and ensured the ec remained intergovernmental by effectively curtailing qualified majority voting as any state could veto by invoking national interests .
",
9265,0,," with greece as a trigger , the eurozone and the whole eu have significantly suffered in the last five years as a result of massive and still on-going economic crisis .
",
9266,0,," the euro currency is , damaged by the vast differences between individual eurozone members , with respect to their fiscal and monetary policies .
",
9267,0,," while some states , commonly referred to as piigs , do have bigger problems with their finances , it is unthinkable for the others to be held responsible when serious issues , such as an inability to pay the debts , arise .
",
9268,0,," nevertheless , this was the case with greece , when tens of billions of taxpayers ' money were used to service debts of one irresponsible state .
",
9269,0,," despite more than% of private sector debt being cut down by creditors , the threat of greece 's default still lingers in the air .
",
9270,0,," getting rid of the unanimity requirement would make europe much more able to respond quickly to crises .
",
9271,0,," in the long run it would make negotiations for a federal union much easier , eventually turning it into reality .
",
9272,0,," achieving political integration and the abandonment of the veto that would come with it would then enable solutions to economic problems benefiting the whole even it unpalatable to some .
",
9273,0,," such position is also taken by jacques attali , a french economist who argues that `` the institutional reform towards a federal europe is necessary to implement a common fiscal and budgetary system . ''
",
9274,1,,"located high in the himalayan mountains, tibet is one of the most isolated places in the world.
",
9275,1,," yet while it is geographically and culturally distinct, it has a long history of interaction with its neighbours.
",
9276,1,," an aggressive series of tibetan rulers built a large empire during the 9th century ad, repeatedly invading china, and while tibet submitted to the mongols, it was never quite conquered.
",
9277,1,,"tibet managed to remain largely independent of both the various chinese and indian dynasties untilwhen the qing dynasty sent a resident commissioner.
",
9278,1,," his power varied – fromuntil the late 19th century he wielded significant control over the court of the dalai llama, but the llama remained nominally absolute, and chinese influence collapsed prior to therevolution.
",
9279,1,,"tibet’s autonomy came to an abrupt end inwhen chinese troops invaded.
",
9280,1,," for the next nine years the dalai llama ruled in uneasy cooperation with the chinese government before fleeing to india in 1959.
",
9281,1,," since that time china has pursued an aggressive campaign of secularization and modernization which on one hand has resulted in a large rise in living standards and the abolition of feudalism, but on the other in repression of tibetan culture and the forced importation of han settlers.
",
9282,1,,"there are two main aspects to the question of tibet’s future.
",
9283,1,," first there are questions of how china has governed tibet.
",
9284,1,," has china failed to govern tibet in an appropriate manner, or has it done a pretty good job?
",
9285,1,," has it violated human rights in tibet?
",
9286,1,," was its exiling of the dalai lama inappropriate?
",
9287,1,," is it illegitimate for china to govern tibet while depriving it of its spiritual and historical leader?
",
9288,1,," does this constitute a suppression of its religious freedoms?
",
9289,1,," how bad are china's human rights violations in tibet relative to human rights violations elsewhere in the world where separatist movements exist?
",
9290,1,," is it really all that bad or are we just being hyper-sensitive to tibet due to the public exposure of the dalai lama and the tibetan case?
",
9291,1,," has china stonewalled tibet on negotiations, or has it been politically reconciliatory?
",
9292,1,," has china economically exploited tibet or helped invest in and modernize it economy?
",
9293,1,," conversely, have tibetans followed ethical and human rights norms in tibet, or have they engaged in the same kind of abuses as the chinese government?
",
9294,1,," have tibetans killed and/or abused chinese settlers in tibet?
",
9295,1,," have tibetan protests been peaceful and respectful, or have they been unethical and/or violent?
",
9296,1,," has the behavior of tibetan exiles been appropriate, or have they been violent and revolutionary?
",
9297,1,," should a tibetan right to self-determination survive any alleged tibetan human rights abuses?
",
9298,1,," does tibet have a history of human right abuses?
",
9299,1,," what effect does this have on tibet's bid for independence?
",
9300,1,,"secondly there are the more moral questions of legitimacy.
",
9301,1,," namely, whether the chinese seizure of tibet was legitimate, and whether that should have any bearing on the present.
",
9302,1,,"finally there are the questions of whether tibet would be a viable independent state.
",
9303,1,," would it be able to resist chinese influence?
",
9304,1,," would it only be able to do so with excessive western aid?
",
9305,1,," would the latter justify chinese fears about dismemberment?
",
9306,1,," what would happen to the han settlers who make up almost half the population?
",
9307,0,," tibet has a long history of independence going back more thanyears .
",
9308,0,," even in times of chinese `` domination '' , tibetans largely governed themselves independently of the small number of chinese officials in lhasa .
",
9309,0,," tibet at most was a tributary of china , and was no more part of it than thailand , myanmar or korea .
",
9310,0,," and fromuntilit was entirely independent and conducted its foreign relations as such , for example remaining neutral in world war ii despite both its neighbours the republic of china and the british empire being on the side of the allies .
",
9311,0,," tibet 's annexation by china occurred under the guns of 40,000 chinese soldiers , and the precedent begun by the invasion stands as one of the few post-1945 cases in which the national principle was abandoned and the only one in which a fully independent state vanished from the map .
",
9312,0,," when one notes that tibetans have their own language , and a history that includes far more wars with the chinese than examples of kinship , chinese arguments of sovereignty have little bearing on the reality .
",
9313,0,," due to systematic campaign of sinocization , millions of han chinese have been encouraged to settle in tibet , and with the support of the government they now dominate the economy and upper echelons of the administration .
",
9314,0,," demographically tibetans are rapidly becoming a minority within their own country , and administratively this has already taken place .
",
9315,0,," while short of open genocide , the intent of the chinese government is quite clearly the elimination of the tibetan people as a distinct national , cultural and linguistic group .
",
9316,0,," not only are they attempting to drown them through settlement , but tibetan students are forced to learn mandarin in the schools and are being taught that they are chinese .
",
9317,0,," while there may well have been past periods of chinese sovereignty , the policies of the current beijing government seem designed to produce an outcome far more permanent than those past efforts which respected tibetan identity and culture .
",
9318,0,," an independent tibet would serve a useful purpose as a neutral and demilitarized buffer state between india and china .
",
9319,0,," given the rising economic and military clout of both powers , a future conflict is becoming ever more likely , and they already fought one war against one another in.
",
9320,0,," an independent tibet would mean that the two nations would no longer have a common border , making their rivalry less practical and far less pressing .
",
9321,0,," this would reduce military obligations for both , and prevent the tibetans from being caught in the middle of a future conflict .
",
9322,0,," tibet , and the resistance tibetans continue to show to chinese rule presents a toxic domestic and international political problem that costs far more than it worth .
",
9323,0,," domestically , violence in tibet is the most serious domestic disturbance facing the chinese government , and the fact that there is nearly constant violence between han settlers and tibetans forces the chinese to alienate everyone in order to contain it .
",
9324,0,," furthermore , the economic and political disenfranchisement of the tibetan people is an enormous domestic problem , as it has led to large numbers becoming unemployed and moving to other parts of china where they form an underclass .
",
9325,0,," internationally , the tibetan issue keeps china 's human rights record in the news and almost torpedoed theolympic games .
",
9326,0,," given that china is already losing money on the province , it may well be worth it for china to jettison it in order to gain much greater international benefits .
",
9327,1,,"one of the great successes of the united nations has been the acceptance that interstate war is wrong, the acceptance that “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.
",
9328,1,," there is some debate about whether this has actually meant that there that there is actually less war, or indeed whether it will actually stop another world war from happening, but one thing it has done is make almost everyone recognise that waging war should be considered to be illegal.
",
9329,1,," now it is generally assumed that initiating a military action against another state can only be legal if there is backing from the united nations security council.
",
9330,1,,"yet there have been attempts to chip away at this concept.
",
9331,1,," innato intervened in kosovo without the authorisation of the security council because russia would not countenance intervention against its ally serbia.
",
9332,1,," the united states did not advance solid legal claims that it was legally entitled to engage in a conflict against serbia as a result of the ethnic cleansing occurring in kosovo.
",
9333,1,," nato did not see unsc authorisation or justify on the basis of self defense it simply ignored the international norm against intervention.
",
9334,1,," in doing so it may have changed that norm.
",
9335,1,,"the us and coalition of the willing’s invasion of iraq was another breach of this norm against interstate war that is not authorised by the security council or in self defense.
",
9336,1,," there was more adherence to norms against the use of military force than in the kosovo campaign; there were attempts to claim self defense, and george w. bush and tony blair went to the security council to try and gain assent to go to war.
",
9337,1,," when this failed they attempted to claim that a previous resolution, 1441, was sufficient authorisation to use force.
",
9338,1,," it is however generally accepted, except by the governments involved, that resolutiondid not by itself authorise force.
",
9339,1,,"since these interventions the concept that there may be a humanitarian reason to intervene has become more accepted.
",
9340,1,," the united nations has not gone for a full doctrine of humanitarian intervention but indid agree to a ‘responsibility to protect’ in which states accepted responsibility to protect against genocide and other crimes against humanity but the acceptance was simply to act, not explicitly an acceptance of the use of force.
",
9341,1,," this was used as justification in a nato action to protect benghazi in 2012, but this air assault, unlike kosovo or iraq, had un security council authorisation as russia and china abstained.
",
9342,1,,"although russia and china abstained in the case of libya on other issues where the united states might want to take action they have not been so obliging.
",
9343,1,," any attempt to attack iran, or syria, or north korea, or practically anywhere for any reason is liable to be blocked.
",
9344,1,," the result from the point of view of the americans is that the security council is broken and as such they may need to go it alone, or in a coalition with other like-minded states.
",
9345,1,," if it is action to prevent atrocities should it be considered legal if the intervening power can’t get authorization from its peers?
",
9346,0,," when a massacre is about to happen it is legal to intervene to prevent that massacre .
",
9347,0,," the ` responsibility to protect ' which was accepted by the un in.
",
9348,0,," resolution 60/1 at theworld summit stated , there was international responsibility `` to help to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
",
9349,0,," in this context , we are prepared to take collective action in a timely and decisive manner . ''
",
9350,0,," though this will only happen `` should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations '' .
",
9351,0,," this is most certainly the case in syria where the national authorities are the ones doing much of the killing .
",
9352,0,," it must be proved that the syrian regime is responsible for the attacks ; the us and uk say there is such evidence but so far the link is not crystal clear .
",
9353,0,," even the uk government accepts that there must be `` convincing evidence , generally accepted by the international community as a whole , of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale , requiring immediate and urgent relief '' .
",
9354,0,," as the doctrine states peaceful means must have been tried -- and in syria after two years of conflict we can safely say a peaceful resolution is not in sight .
",
9355,0,," and the use of force must be proportionate -- which since there is no plan for a full scale invasion in syria it will be .
",
9356,0,," a second possible justification for intervention is when the state that is intervening against is itself breaking international law such as the chemical weapons convention or the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
",
9357,0,," the intervention would then be to force compliance of the treaty ; this would mean forcible disarmament of illegal weapons .
",
9358,0,," in the case of syria the country could be deemed to have violated its own legal obligations due to its having broken thegeneva protocol that bans the use of chemical weapons .
",
9359,0,," since manufacturing and possession of these weapons is banned if it is considered that having such weapons is a ` gross violation of international law ' then a limited use of force to destroy these weapons could be considered to be legal .
",
9360,0,," this could be considered to be analogous to the police stepping in to confiscate a banned weapon , with no police internationally other states have to be the ones to step in .
",
9361,0,," the international prohibition on the use of force has always been honoured in large part in the breach leading to the question of whether it should really be considered to be binding international law at all .
",
9362,0,," almost every major country has launched an illegal offensive action at some point ; the usa has been involved in kosovo and iraq , the uk and france in attacking egypt in, china in attacking vietnam in, and russia , as the ussr , in attacking afghanistan also in.
",
9363,0,," in each instance of unilateral offensive action there will be justifications and a ` smoke screen ' to make the conflict appear to be legal when in fact it is not .
",
9364,0,," major powers should simply admit that they do not regard the prohibition of the use of force as binding on them .
",
9365,0,," even without admitting it because international law is based upon state behaviour the use of force is legal as michael j glennon suggests `` the consent of united nations member states to the general prohibition against the use of force , as expressed in the charter , has in this way been supplanted by a changed intent as expressed in deeds . ''
",
9366,1,,"definitions vary, but a failed state is usually thought of as one where any government has broken down to the point where it can no longer provide certain essential services to the people.
",
9367,1,," most importantly, this often means that law and order has collapsed, with the government losing its monopoly over the legitimate use of force.
",
9368,1,," in such cases, large areas of the country are in the control of non-government forces, perhaps through civil war but often as a result of lawlessness and banditry.
",
9369,1,," recent estimates by foreign policy and the fund for peace (see further reading) suggest that up tobillion people worldwide live in insecure states where the government has either failed or is fragile, and are exposed to varying degrees of violence as a result.
",
9370,1,,"the most complete example of a failed state is perhaps somalia, where no government has been able to take effective control of the country since the death of its dictator siad barre.
",
9371,1,," haiti, the democratic republic of congo and cote d'ivoire provide other commonly-discussed examples.
",
9372,1,," states recovering from recent collapse could include liberia, sierra leone and angola, although in none of these is recovery certain, while cambodia, mozambique, lebanon and east timor provide examples of relative longer-term success after periods of failure.
",
9373,1,," today many observers are gloomy about the futures of countries including zimbabwe, nepal, guinea, afghanistan, chad, sudan, bolivia and iraq, as well as the palestinian territories.
",
9374,1,,"proponents of preventative intervention argue it is necessary to prevent the suffering of civilians innocent of the decisions taken on the route to failure, and that allowing failure would risk regional instability.
",
9375,1,," opponents maintain, in contrast, that the cost of intervention is too high and that to provide a safety net to failing states would only encourage other struggling states to take risks.
",
9376,0,,"  states should act to help the people of a failing state , as once it collapses no government services will be provided , including law and order .
",
9377,0,," states should work with the un in leading attempts at conflict resolution , and should engage in subsequent peacekeeping missions and investment in nation-building initiatives , e.g. funding and organising the reintegration of non-combatants into society , organising elections , building up civil society , creating effective government institutions , etc. .
",
9378,0,," the failure of the un operation in somalia inis telling ; the country has not had a functioning central government ever since .
",
9379,0,," intervention to prevent such outcomes will require both greater willingness to commit funds on the part of the powerful states and a commitment to conflict resolution which has been largely lacking in recent national policy world-wide .
",
9380,0,," it is in the interests of international stability that failing states are rescued before it is too late .
",
9381,0,," failed states often infect a whole region , as the collapse of liberia did in west africa - a problem known as contagion .
",
9382,0,," neighbouring states back different factions with arms and squabble over resources , such as the diamonds of sierra leone and the mineral wealth of congo .
",
9383,0,," internally neighbours are destabilised by floods of refugees and weapons from next door .
",
9384,0,," their own rebel groups can also easily find shelter to regroup and mount fresh attacks in the lawless country just over their borders .
",
9385,0,," former u.n. secretary boutros-ghali claimed , as his justification for support for failing states , that the u.n. has a responsibility under its charter to ` maintain international peace and security ' amid fears ` the demise of a state is often marked by violence and widespread human rights violations that affect other states ' .
",
9386,0,," intervention prevents this by entailing the establishment of conditions for reconstruction which thereafter provides physical infrastructure , facilities and social services .
",
9387,0,," the ultimate goal therefore of the intervention is to ensure that both the state concerned and the region as a whole require no further military or monetary support .
",
9388,0,," failed states also export dangers more widely , as they often provide an opportunity for drug crops such as opium , afghanistan , or coca , parts of colombia , to be grown , processed and traded without fear of authority , with devastating effects both locally and globally .
",
9389,0,," desperate people may also take refuge in religious or political extremism , which may in time come to threaten the rest of the world .
",
9390,0,," in so doing , failed states often become havens for terrorists , who can find safety in them to plot against the west , to establish training camps for future terrorists , and to build up finance , weapons and other resources with which to mount campaigns .
",
9391,0,," in what was a key claim that later underpinned theus national security strategy and the u.s. war on terror , stephen walt , a professor of international relations at harvard university , has described failed states as ` breeding grounds of instability , mass migration , and murder ' .
",
9392,0,," this can be seen in somalia , where states in recent years have ` begun to fear al qaeda will take advantage of the lawlessness ' .
",
9393,0,," other fragile states , such as niger , congo and sierra leone have radioactive and other valuable minerals which could be very dangerous in the hands of determined terrorists .
",
9394,0,," the usa should work with the un to strengthen governments so that they can more effectively maintain internal order while controlling their borders and tracking resource-flows .
",
9395,0,," the united nations , and its resident body , the security council , has both the right and the capability to intervene in countries in order to maintain the peace .
",
9396,0,," peace in this sense represents more than the absence of bloodshed , but also provides the means by which aid organizations can enter a territory and provide the requisite resources to prevent civilian suffering .
",
9397,0,," the united nations have proven their efficacy in this area , mandating an intervention in the ivory coast inthat sought to prevent the exacerbation of tensions between the government and rebel forces .
",
9398,0,," a ceasefire was eventually brokered inand the failure of the state averted .
",
9399,0,," u.n. forces in macedonia during the 1990s were also credited with ` successfully contributing to the prevention of conflict spill over and having a stabilizing effect in the country ' .
",
9400,0,," u.n. interventions to prevent the failure of states can and do work .
",
9401,1,,"the first thing to note here is that we are not considering a broad brush treaty on internet governance that covers all sorts of questions such as who creates domain names as such an agreement would be very difficult to hammer out as shown by the failure at the international telecommunications union in 2012.
",
9402,1,," instead this would be a treaty purely between governments and limited to cybersecurity; as it is a national security issue it is clearly a governmental issue.
",
9403,1,,"what are cyber-attacks?
",
9404,1,," this could potentially mean the use of cyberspace in war but that is not what we are going to debate; the chances of states adhering to such an international treaty in a war situation would seem to be slim and it would be of little use the rest of the time.
",
9405,1,," instead we are talking about the multitude of attacks that are launched every day.
",
9406,1,," the ban would most clearly apply to state actors but for convenience sake it might be best to consider it outlawing all cyber attacks and placing the burden on each state to tackle it as a domestic law enforcement issue.
",
9407,1,,"andrea renda of the centre for european policy studies suggests:this would simply mean putting these into treaty form.
",
9408,1,," note this debate directly follows on from a previous debatabase debate on whether sanctions could be used as a response to cyber-attacks and covers many of the same issues.
",
9409,0,," conflict needs to be regulated , and something that can start conflicts even more so .
",
9410,0,," warfare and conflict is currently regulated by the geneva conventions that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict and regulate the conduct of the involved actors .
",
9411,0,," just as importantly there are rules on what weapons can be used through various treaties that ban weapons such as the land mine ban , and on when a state can legally initiate conflict through the un charter .
",
9412,0,," in just the same way when a new area of potential conflict arises that too must be regulated by treaty .
",
9413,0,," the internet and the threat of cyber-conflict is that new area at the moment .
",
9414,0,," while cyber warfare is not currently a large scale threat it is still a form of conflict that could escalate just like any other - the pentagon has explicitly stated it could respond militarily to a cyber-attack .
",
9415,0,," as a result it is most sensible to draw up the rules and regulations early , to ensure everyone knows the consequences and prevent damage by making sure that states agree not to engage in offence cyber-attacks against each other .
",
9416,0,," once a treaty is set up to limit or eliminate cyber-attacks monitoring is unlikely to be a problem because states will be willing to monitor each other .
",
9417,0,," states in order to defend themselves from cyber-attacks already monitor the cyber-attacks that occur -- the united states for example already has several cyber defense forces .
",
9418,0,," if that is not enough then there are numerous private groups that will be monitoring cyber-attacks as most are made against corporate rather than government targets .
",
9419,0,," for example private company mandiant exposed a unit of the people 's liberation army for its cyber-attacks in february.
",
9420,0,," once a cyber-attack has been traced and evidence gathered if the appropriate domestic authorities wo n't deal with the culprit then an independent international institution can decide on the punishment for the government that is not living up to its treaty commitments .
",
9421,0,," if there is a need for international monitoring rather than simply a dispute settlement mechanism then there are models available through current treaties ; a un organisation similar to the international atomic energy agency or international criminal court could be set up that can investigate incidents when asked .
",
9422,0,," ever since the state rose to ascendancy over powerful internal actors , such as the nobility in a feudal system , the state has had a monopoly on the use of force .
",
9423,0,," the state quickly became the only institution with the resources to maintain military forces and has become the only legitimate wielder of force .
",
9424,0,," the internet however changes this .
",
9425,0,," cyber-attacks are often by individuals or groups who can carry out a cross border attack without the aid of their home country .
",
9426,0,," incia director leon panetta told congress `` when it comes to national security , i think this represents the battleground for the future .
",
9427,0,," i 've often said that i think the potential for the next pearl harbor could very well be a cyber-attack . ''
",
9428,0,," if cyber-attacks are so important it stands to reason that the groups who are able to engage in such activities should be as limited as possible .
",
9429,0,," while it is not always possible states try to make sure that the weapons of war for the most part remain in the hands of responsible actors .
",
9430,0,," this should apply as much in cyberspace as elsewhere .
",
9431,0,," while terrorist groups do exist -- and are occasionally armed by states -- for the most part they are seen by every government as being illegitimate .
",
9432,0,," a treaty that bans , or sharply curtails cyber-attacks would benefit every state .
",
9433,0,," even those who may currently benefit from cyber espionage would be better off signing up to the treaty .
",
9434,0,," first most cyber-attacks are not carried out by the state even in countries like china where the state is using the internet as an offensive tool .
",
9435,0,," in its annual report to congress the department of defence stated some cyber-attacks `` appear to be attributable directly to the chinese government and military '' but this does not sound like a majority .
",
9436,0,," secondly no state wants a risk of conflict as a result of an unregulated new field of potential conflict .
",
9437,0,," or even to risk relations with other nations ; cyber-attacks in large part go on because they are cost free .
",
9438,0,," and finally all nations are the victims of cyber-attacks .
",
9439,0,," the united states has repeatedly condemned cyber-attacks against it but china also claims that it is the victim of cyber-attacks .
",
9440,0,," china 's minister of national defense general chang wanquan says `` china is one of the primary victims of hacker attacks in the world . ''
",
9441,0,," having a treaty against cyber attacks would not only make business easier for all countries but it would build up trust between nations where it is currently being eroded .
",
9442,1,,"the yasukuni shrine was established as the tōkyō shōkonsha inand renamed yasukuni shrine in 1879.
",
9443,1,," this was immediately after the boshin war – a conflict between supporters of the shōgunate and those who wanted to restore the emperor to political power – the emperor meiji ordered the construction of the shrine to honor those who had died for their country during this war.
",
9444,1,,"“i assure those of you who fought and died for your country that your names will live forever at this shrine in musashino” so reads a poem composed by the emperor meiji for the shrine demonstrating the purpose of the shrine to honor those who have fought and died for japan.
",
9445,1,," in this the yasukuni is not too dissimilar from other national cemeteries around the world.
",
9446,1,,"  arlington national cemetery in the united states’ mission is “on behalf of the american people, lay to rest those who have served our nation with dignity and honor.”
",
9447,1,," this is very similar to meiji’s poem.
",
9448,1,," daejeon national cemetery in south korea’s introduction message says “daejeon national cemetery is the sacred place in which those who sacrificed themselves to protect and defend our people and nation are buried in peaceful rest”.
",
9449,1,,"where the yasukuni is different is in the controversy surrounding it.
",
9450,1,," there are 2,466,000 souls enshrined at the shrine and almost all of these are military.
",
9451,1,," they are from those who died during wars fought by japan from the bonshin war through to the second world war.
",
9452,1,," however most of these conflicts (with the exception of the bonshin war and the satsuma rebellion) were wars of aggression.
",
9453,1,,"most controversial however is the enshrinement of war criminals.
",
9454,1,," at the end of world war ii the victorious allies instituted the international military tribunal for the far east, otherwise known as the tokyo trials, to try those japanese who had played large roles in planning the war or had allowed criminal acts to take place.
",
9455,1,," there were more thanjapanese charged with war crimes.
",
9456,1,,"of these are enshrined at yasukuni.
",
9457,1,," fourteen of the enshrined are class a criminals, including the hideki tōjō prime minister during world war ii, who were convicted of crimes against peace “namely, planning, preparation, initiation, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing”.
",
9458,1,,"not all japanese recognise that these people were war criminals with a phamphlet at yasukuni having stated “some 1,068 people, who were wrongly accused as war criminals by the allied court, were enshrined here”.
",
9459,1,," many japanese consider the courts to be victor’s justice.
",
9460,1,," there is therefore a conflict as a result of a minority in japan who believe they should honor their dead in yasukuni and essentially deny that the problem of war criminals exists.
",
9461,1,,"yasukuni is has only quite recently become a political controversy.
",
9462,1,," during theyears fromto koizumi becoming prime minister there were only visits on four occasions by prime ministers, with only one of them an official visit.
",
9463,1,," prime minister koizumi visited every year he was in office but prime ministers have not visited since.
",
9464,1,," despite this controversy had continued as cabinet ministers continue to visit, the prime minister has sometimes sent an aide with an offering in his stead as abe did onaugust 2013, and each visit by any cabinet minister sparks protest and outrage from japan’s neighbours.
",
9465,1,,"a related lesser controversy is that some of the 27,863 taiwanese andkoreans who are enshrined at yasukuni are there against the wishes of the deceased’s families leading to accusations that they have in effect been kidnapped in death.
",
9466,1,,"p.s. this might be better with the motion switched around to be ‘this house would not visit the yasukuni shrine’ because the status quo is that politicians, including senior ones, visit almost every year.
",
9467,1,," however i believe that making motions negative adds an element of confusion making it more difficult to follow.
",
9468,0,," the arguments would be the same anyway, simply reversed.
",
9469,0,,"every nation should be allowed to honor its war dead how it wishes .
",
9470,0,," wars are horrifying times and atrocities are almost always committed by all sides .
",
9471,0,," japan 's actions in its wars , particularly the second world war were particularly brutal but this should not mean that japans leaders should be banned from paying their respects to their ancestors who died fighting for their country .
",
9472,0,," most nations do this in one way or another .
",
9473,0,," the difference is that yasukuni has those who were convicted criminals enshrined but others also honor those who have committed acts that might be considered criminal .
",
9474,0,," perhaps the most extreme example is the mausoleum of mao zedong right at the heart of beijing where there are still big celebrations to mark his birthday -- unlike shintoism in japan maoism is still very much part of the ideology of the state .
",
9475,0,," everyone is entitled to freedom of religion and that applies to the japanese as much as any other peoples .
",
9476,0,," yasukuni is a shrine in the shinto religion -- equivalent to a church - and was the center of state shinto through the first half of the twentieth century .
",
9477,0,," refusing to allow japanese ministers to visit the shrine might therefore be said to be similar to barring british politicians from westminster abbey because there is a memorial stone to oliver cromwell there and as a result it could be interpreted as offensive to the irish -- westminister abbey 's page notably avoids mentioning the wexford and drogheda massacres that are remembered by the irish .
",
9478,0,," the vast majority of members of the government when visiting yasukuni do so only in a private capacity and not as representatives of the government .
",
9479,0,," as private individuals in their own lives anyone should be allowed to visits any such sites they wish .
",
9480,0,," minister keiji furuya argues `` paying homage to the war dead is a purely domestic matter and it 's not for other countries to criticize us or intervene in these matters '' and prime minister abe agrees that it should not be a diplomatic issue `` as for when i might go to yasukuni shrine , or whether i will go or not , i will not say as this should not become a political or diplomatic issue '' .
",
9481,0,," that there has been controversy and criticism even when it clearly is a domestic private matter , such as former republic of china , taiwan , president lee teng-hui visiting the grave of his elder brother inshows that critics , in this case the people 's republic of china , are simply interested in finding an opportunity to attack the japanese government .
",
9482,1,,"while the israeli-palestinian conflict has many components, the struggle for land is at its centre, and therefore the legitimacy or lack thereof of israeli settlements in the west bank has become symbolic of the conflict.
",
9483,1,,"to the palestinians, the israeli settlements represent the slow erosion of their national claims occurring in front of their eyes.
",
9484,1,," even if some smaller settlements are removed in a final peace agreement, many palestinians are sceptical that the larger ones will ever be removed.
",
9485,1,," a number of israeli politicians share that view, and while the original argument for the creation of settlements in the late 1970s was one of security, many israeli far-right politicians such as avigador lieberman now admit that the goal of further construction is to alter the “facts on the ground.”
",
9486,1,,"equally importantly however, the settlement issue is increasingly seen as a measure of the ability and willingness of the united states government to buck israel publicly.
",
9487,0,," president obama has been lambasted by republicans for his stand calling for a halt to settlement construction – president george hw bush, who actually cancelled a major loan to israel over the issue faced a rebellion within his own party, and believed that the backlash helped to cost him re-election in 1992.
",
9488,0,,"the settlements , constructed on land that is neither recognizably israel 's nor which israel has even claimed to annex are illegal , encroaching on the territory of a future palestinian state .
",
9489,0,," it is absurd for the international community to demand the creation of a palestinian state in the west bank , and yet allow israel to establish its population on that land in settlements that view themselves and are viewed by israel as israeli territory .
",
9490,0,," furthermore , their continued expansion is something that each and every palestinian can see every day .
",
9491,0,," as a result , the continued expansion both :.
",
9492,0,," destroys palestinian confidence in the ability and willingness of the international community to enforce its own promises , especially after repeated american and european promises to stop their construction .
",
9493,0,," 2 .
",
9494,0,," convinces palestinian opinion that the negotiating process is an israeli game to buy time until they have changed the facts on the ground .
",
9495,0,," as a consequence of these two factors , the continued expansion of settlements has an impact in driving palestinians towards violent resistance even beyond the direct impact of the settlement construction by undermining their faith in international law , and by adding a sense of urgency to their grievances .
",
9496,0,," whether deliberate or not , the settlements are changing the `` facts on the ground '' by changing the political calculus for future israeli governments .
",
9497,0,," while most israeli politicians accept the need to abandon some smaller settlements , the vast majority are unlikely to be evacuated .
",
9498,0,," it was politically divisive to the point of breaking the likud party in two when ariel sharon , a man with more credit than anyone else on the israeli right pulled out of gaza in, and there were only a little overisraeli settlers there .
",
9499,0,," by contrast there are now more than 300,000 settlers in the west bank , and this number is rising fast .
",
9500,0,," there were less than 200,000 in.
",
9501,0,," of these settlers , many are religious and vote for the haridam , orthodox , parties like the national religious party .
",
9502,0,," because the party has served in governments of both the left and the right in recent years , in practice they and the ultra-nationalist israel beitinu tend to hold the balance of power in the israeli knesset .
",
9503,0,," therefore every time israel expands settlements , they are reducing their room to manoeuvre in future peace negotiations , and forcing themselves to take a harder stance .
",
9504,0,," this means that peace will either become less likely , because israel will set more extreme terms , or that israel will face more internal divisions in order to offer it .
",
9505,0,," in either case , as the settlements expand as important as the existence of the settlements themselves is their continued growth .
",
9506,0,," the very fact that israel has continued to ostensibly negotiate for the independence of a palestinian state in the west bank on one hand while rapidly expanding the population and the size of israeli settlements can be interpreted as a sign of bad faith .
",
9507,0,," for one thing , it raises questions of the seriousness with which israel is attempting to reach an agreement .
",
9508,0,," even if the programs of settlement expansion are intended as a temporary policy in lieu of a settlement , the very fact that israel 's plan b is arguably as popular as peace , and being pursued with far more vigour could lead many palestinians to conclude that israel is attempting to run out the clock .
",
9509,0,," the consequences of this are inauspicious for the peace process .
",
9510,0,," as palestinian faith in the prospect of peaceful negotiations falters , groups like hamas are likely to find an increasingly receptive audience for their view that only force will compel israel to negotiate seriously .
",
9511,0,," this in turn will make compromise all the more difficult to achieve .
",
9512,0,," the settlements themselves are self-perpetuating in a manner that makes them pernicious to the rights and very existence of neighbouring palestinian communities .
",
9513,0,," for one thing , a settlement can not function in isolation .
",
9514,0,," it needs a road for its residents to safely travel to and from work in israel .
",
9515,0,," security needs subsequently require that this road be protected from attacks by creating a large military presence along its route , and in many cases moving existing palestinian settlements .
",
9516,0,," at the very least palestinian areas are bisected by impassable thoroughfares .
",
9517,0,," in turn settlements require their fields to be protected by high walls and electric fences to protect them from attack , and the construction crews building them also require protection .
",
9518,0,," the result is that even a settlement of a few hundred families rapidly requires the takeover of an amount of land out of all proportion to the actual number of settlers involved , and any further expansion compounds the problem .
",
9519,0,," the security needs of settlements create a situation which makes the livelihood of palestinians impossible .
",
9520,0,," the existence of the settlements makes these security policies a necessity .
",
9521,0,," as a consequence , the only clear solution is the removal of the settlements .
",
9522,1,,"in july 2002, the fifty-three members of the organization of african unity (oau) disbanded that organization and inaugurated the african union (au).
",
9523,1,," the goal of the au is to create an international organization similar to the european union.
",
9524,1,," the oau itself says its objectives are “to rid the continent of the remaining vestiges of colonization and apartheid; to promote unity and solidarity among african states; to coordinate and intensify cooperation for development; to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states and to promote international cooperation within the framework of the united nations.”
",
9525,1,," it is to have a central bank, to be fully functioning by 2028, and a shared currency.
",
9526,1,," already there is a pan-african parliament, an african court of justice and an african ""peace and security council"" has been created.
",
9527,1,,"the au is, in part, the brainchild of libya’s now deposed muammar qaddafi who withdrew libya from the arab league.
",
9528,1,," qaddafi regularly called for a united states of africa, possibly with him as its first president.
",
9529,1,," he had also suggested a unified african gold dinar as a currency with the intention that it would be based on gold rather than the us dollar.
",
9530,1,," qaddafi’s downfall does not leave the idea entirely without support as other states such as eritrea, ghana, senegal and zimbabwe has shown interest.
",
9531,1,," despite qaddafi leaving the scene the idea of a “united and integrated” africa has not been abandoned, although it is likely the original timescale of it being done bywill likely have to be extended.
",
9532,0,," integration can bring peace ; just like the european union has in europe .
",
9533,0,," since the fall of the berlin wall , the un has slowly changed its relationship with regional organizations .
",
9534,0,," it is more willing and through its agenda for peace has been demanding that regional organizations be responsible for peacekeeping , state-building and humanitarian assistance .
",
9535,0,," part of the reasoning is that these states are more sensitive to local customs , concerns and diplomacy .
",
9536,0,," already , the african union has taken on several peacekeeping initiatives ; first in burundi in 2003m and more recently on-going missions in in darfur , sudan , sinceand in somalia since.
",
9537,0,," the au also allows regional economic communities to take a lead in responding threats to peace so allowing action to be taken at the appropriate level .
",
9538,0,," while african integration has been slow there has been real progress in constructing the building blocks to allow further integration .
",
9539,0,," african countries are already somewhat integrated : for examplecountries in west and central africa use the cfa franc as currency and there are regional blocks in west africa and east africa .
",
9540,0,," the existence of these regional free trade areas the economic community of central african states , eccas , the economic community of west african states , ecowas , the east african community , eac , common market for eastern and southern african countries , comesa , and the southern african development community , sadc , will eventually provide the springboard for further integration throughout the whole of africa .
",
9541,0,," the latter three of these communities have signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on integration and harmonise areas such as trade .
",
9542,0,," more importantly , despite problems with the creation of a single currency , the eu remains a good model for the au : no one would suggest that the eu is in danger of being disbanded .
",
9543,0,," though its members might have differences as to its exact structure , that debate is no different than in any other confederation .
",
9544,0,," for some commentators , africa 's biggest problem is that its countries are remnants of colonial empires .
",
9545,0,," in the post-colonial period , borders were drawn between states randomly , creating ethnic tension and geographic dissonance .
",
9546,0,," qaddafi argued that peace will break out when africa 's borders disappear .
",
9547,0,," as saadi touval argued `` the borders are blamed for the disappearance of a unity which supposed existed in africa in precolonial times ... the borders are considered to be one of the humiliating legacies of colonialism , which , according to this view , independent africa ought to abolish '' .
",
9548,0,," though unification is the end goal , the short-term objective is to create an african free trade area with some semblance of regional organization .
",
9549,0,," most importantly , the au has abandoned the notion of absolute `` state sovereignty '' : it can `` peer review '' the human rights and political situation in any of its members .
",
9550,0,," the eu was established after wwii to assist in the rebuilding of europe ; why ca n't the au do the same in africa ?
",
9551,1,,"at the end of the cold war, believing that the nuclear threat had finally receded, much of the world breathed a collective sigh of relief.
",
9552,1,," victory in the cold war, however, sowed the seeds of a new threat: that of nuclear proliferation (the spread of nuclear weapons).
",
9553,1,," in recent years this topic has never been far from the headlines.
",
9554,1,," in 2003, iraq's nuclear program was given as one justification for the second gulf war.
",
9555,1,," in theus presidential election campaign, both president bush and senator kerry identified nuclear proliferation as the single biggest security threat facing the united states.
",
9556,1,," inthe international body set up to prevent proliferation, the international atomic energy authority (iaea) and its director, mohamed elbaradei, were awarded the nobel peace prize in recognition of their work.
",
9557,1,," the cornerstone of the international law concerning nuclear weapons is the non-proliferation treaty (npt).
",
9558,1,," every state in the world except india, israel, pakistan and north korea are signatories.
",
9559,1,," north korea was a member but withdrew in 2003.
",
9560,1,," under the npt, five states (china, france, russia, the uk and the us) are recognized as having the right to possess nuclear weapons.
",
9561,1,," these states are known as the nuclear weapon states (nws).
",
9562,1,," the other states, the non-nuclear weapon states (nnws), have promised not to acquire nuclear weapons.
",
9563,1,," in return, they have 'the inalienable right' to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
",
9564,1,," one cause of proliferation is that civilian nuclear programs can be used to make the fuel for a nuclear bomb (the hardest part of any nuclear weapons program).
",
9565,1,," specifically, there are two routes for making reactor fuel: uranium enrichment (in which uranium ore is refined) and plutonium reprocessing (in which plutonium is separated from used reactor fuel).
",
9566,1,," however, exactly the same processes can be used to refine the product still further and make weapons-grade material.
",
9567,1,," the iaea was set up to monitor civilian nuclear programs and ensure that they are used for legitimate purposes.
",
9568,1,," the iaea inspects nuclear facilities and, if it believes that a state is using them to build a nuclear weapon, then it must report this to the united nations security council.
",
9569,1,," the usual objection to iaea effectiveness is its inability to access states that haven’t signed the npt.
",
9570,1,," the us has recently become frustrated with iaea efforts and has started to work outside the framework of the ntp.
",
9571,1,," in particular, president bush had proposed that enrichment and reprocessing facilities should be denied to states that do already possess them.
",
9572,1,," he has also started the proliferation security initiative, an informal arrangement between the us and its allies to share intelligence and intercept suspect cargoes at sea.
",
9573,1,," note that the us essentially views these actions as a supplement, rather than an alternative, to the npt and iaea.
",
9574,1,," nobody would deny that the iaea has had some successes, and few in the us are keen to abandon the npt entirely; rather this debate is about whether it is effective for the us to take additional action to prevent nuclear proliferation.
",
9575,0,," a very current issue is the question of iran and the chances of it acquiring nuclear weapons, where iaea sanctions and warnings have been ignored by iran or considered ineffective by some countries, like the usa.
",
9576,0,,"states can legally acquire the capacity to build a nuclear bomb and then withdraw from the treaty .
",
9577,0,," the essential problem is that uranium and plutonium are used as fuel for both nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs .
",
9578,0,," the processes by which these materials are manufactured , uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing , are permitted because they have legitimate applications in civilian nuclear programs .
",
9579,0,," on its website it is stated : `` the iaea verifies through its inspection system that states comply with their commitments , under the non-proliferation treaty and other non-proliferation agreements , to use nuclear material and facilities only for peaceful purposes . ''
",
9580,0,," providing a state ` plays along ' with the iaea and allows inspections , it can legally acquire these technologies .
",
9581,0,," then , once it is in a position to produce material suitable for use in a weapon , it can simply leave the npt .
",
9582,0,," all a state then has to do to leave the npt is givemonths ' notice ; the iaea is then left powerless .
",
9583,0,," indeed , this is precisely what north korea did , and what it is feared that iran will do .
",
9584,0,," north korea is known to have reprocessing technology , and it probably has an enrichment capability too .
",
9585,0,," init withdrew from the npt , following the breakdown of an agreement with the us , placing its facilities out of the reach of the iaea .
",
9586,0,," although international law has succeeded in preventing proliferation in some cases , its ` optional ' nature means that to be truly effective it must sometimes be bolstered by american unilateral action .
",
9587,0,," the iaea 's approach to non-proliferation , monitoring nuclear facilities , focuses , almost entirely , on what is known as the demand side .
",
9588,0,," america can supplement this with a counter-proliferation strategy that focuses on preventing supply .
",
9589,0,," a us-led coalition has , for example , started the proliferation security initiative , psi .
",
9590,0,," states within the psi have agreed to share intelligence about unlawful shipments of nuclear materials and then intercept these cargoes at sea .
",
9591,0,," this strategy enables the us to prevent proliferation to organizations which are outside of the iaea 's reach , namely terrorist organizations and states which are not party to , or ignore , the npt .
",
9592,0,," although exact details are kept secret , a number of illegal shipments have been stopped and seized under psi .
",
9593,0,," a second example of america 's supply-side approach is the proposal to stop the spread of reprocessing and enrichment .
",
9594,0,," clearly , preventing potential proliferators from buying the technology to produce nuclear weapons in the first place is a more effective strategy than monitoring it once it is in the hands of states which may abuse it .
",
9595,0,," unlike the iaea , the usa is able to take fast , decisive action against a potential proliferator .
",
9596,0,," in contrast , the united states can act quickly and decisively .
",
9597,0,," quickly because there is usually consensus between the president and congress about proliferation issues .
",
9598,0,," decisively because of the massive diplomatic , economic and , in extreme cases , military power at the usa 's disposal .
",
9599,0,," this power can not only be used to stop a potential proliferator in its tracks but is also an effective deterrent to states trying to go nuclear .
",
9600,0,," in an example , the us was able to take decisive action in kosovo when the rest of the world was dealing with bureaucracy , instead of helping the people there .
",
9601,1,,"federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen.
",
9602,1,," it is distinct both from systems of government where all executive authority rests with a single institution (unitary government) and also from those systems where the decisions at the highest level of government can affect only the state’s interactions with other states and not the functions of lower levels of government or its citizens (confederal government).
",
9603,1,,"federal systems of government are characterised by two principles - the idea of subsidiarity, which relates to the distribution of powers between the different levels of government, and democracy, which relates to the way in which decisions are taken at any given level.
",
9604,1,,"in the context of federalism, subsidiarity is invoked as the reason for allocating decisions to one level of government rather than another.
",
9605,1,," it is usually defined as insisting that political power should be as decentralised as possible, and only centralised if necessary.
",
9606,1,," democracy is achieved as each level of government will have its own political relationship with the citizen.
",
9607,1,," its politicians will hold office because they have won elections specifically for that purpose, rather than because they have been nominated by a different level of government instead.
",
9608,1,," a federal legislature will be composed of directly elected mps rather than mps nominated by the parliaments of its member states.
",
9609,1,,"a federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them.
",
9610,1,," the core problem, however, with creating a federal system of governance within europe is the sovereignity issue – countries will lose their original power and absolute control over their territories and population.
",
9611,1,," developed countries such as the western european powers do not want to grant such control to only one government, which is going to decide the fate of the entire continent.
",
9612,1,,"federalism implies a strong degree of subsidiarity, with power devolved to the lowest appropriate level, rather than a very centralised state (such as france or britain were before reforms in the 1990s).
",
9613,1,," this implies that the current states within the eu, while losing overall independence, would retain considerable powers over issues such as culture, education, law and order, infrastructure, and the taxation and justice systems required to support these, as the states within the u.s.a do today.
",
9614,1,," devotees of subsidiarity would, however, also wish national governments to devolve other existing powers downwards to their regions and local authorities, further weakening the role of today’s national politicians within a future federal europe.
",
9615,0,," a federal europe would build upon the success of the eu and its predecessors in taming the nationalism that caused so much conflict in the twentieth century .
",
9616,0,," the eu is drawing nearer to realising the vision of its founders for an `` ever-closer union '' .
",
9617,0,," despite the eu 's relative success in this regard , while national governments still exist they will regard policy-making within europe as a competitive business , abusing vetoes and damaging the potential prosperity of all of europe 's citizens .
",
9618,0,," such is the case with britain 's veto over the carbon tax , which the eu wants to implement - `` the british government is `` highly likely '' to block european commission proposals for a carbon tax contained in a widely-circulated draft version of the energy taxation directive , eu diplomatic sources said yesterday '' .
",
9619,0,," a federal european state can build on the shared history and culture of its members to further the common good , while accommodating regional differences .
",
9620,0,," a federal europe will be more advantageous for individual citizens , since they will be living in a powerful state , yet with respect of their cultural and local situation subsidiarity combines maximum effectiveness with maximum accountability , with decisions being made at the lowest appropriate level .
",
9621,0,," citizens gain the advantages of living in a large , powerful state in terms of international economic , military and political power , all available more cheaply in a state ofmillion people , and through their increased opportunities for work , study , etc, yet the advantages of living in a smaller state are preserved in terms of connection to the political process , respect for local cultural traditions and responsiveness to differing economic and physical situations .
",
9622,0,," such checks and balances prevent tyranny and increase willing obedience to laws .
",
9623,0,," overall , we now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the european level .
",
9624,0,," eu political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organisation .
",
9625,0,," the challenge facing the european union in the future is to fill the gap between itself and the citizen , providing a political connection equal to the social , cultural and sporting connections that the single market has already provided .
",
9626,0,," federalism and subsidiarity can allow for regional identities in a way national states can not -- e.g. for northern ireland , corsica , basque region , lombardy .
",
9627,0,," in a federal europe such peoples would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long-running conflicts could be resolved , as issues of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structures .
",
9628,0,," a federal europe will be better equipped to promote the interests of its citizens in the world , carrying more influence in the un , wto , imf and other intergovernmental and treaty organisations than its individual states do now .
",
9629,0,," furthermore , europe has a lot to contribute to the world in terms of its liberal traditions and political culture , providing both a partner and a necessary balance to the usa in global affairs .
",
9630,0,," once unified , europe will become an , even more , important negotiating and trading partner -- one of the biggest economies in the world .
",
9631,0,," it will have a population ofmillion -- more than the united states and russia combined .
",
9632,0,," it will be the world 's biggest trader and generate one quarter of global wealth .
",
9633,0,," it presently gives more aid to poor countries than any other donor .
",
9634,0,," its currency , the euro , comes second only to the us dollar in international financial markets .
",
9635,0,," france , germany , poland - these countries can hardly ever negotiate something with giants such as the us or china .
",
9636,0,," europe as one country stands a better chance of putting its message across effectively .
",
9637,0,," the success of federal states elsewhere in providing peace and prosperity for their citizens , alongside democratic safeguards , point to the advantages of pursuing this model in europe .
",
9638,0,," the usa , australia and canada provide standards of living for their citizens which most europeans would envy , while federal india is the best example of a long-term democratic success in the developing world .
",
9639,0,," the application of the principles of federalism to the european social and environmental policy s the key to european success .
",
9640,0,," the creation of the single market meant that much national regulation of social and environmental issues ceased to be effective : only a european approach at the same level as the regulation of business would be able to work .
",
9641,0,," otherwise , companies might simply transfer from one member state with a great deal of regulation in these areas to another member state with less .
",
9642,0,," if what economists call `` externalities '' were not to go unaddressed altogether , european social and environmental policies became necessary .
",
9643,0,," therefore only federal unity can bring eu states closer together in order for them to work as successfully as others federal countries .
",
9644,0,," in a globalised economy , there is a need to tame multinational corporations , which would be otherwise capable of playing national governments off against each other in search for low wages , social costs and state protection .
",
9645,0,," a federal europe would be powerful enough to demand high standards of behaviour from such companies , because only a powerful and economically significant player can dictate restricting conditions .
",
9646,0,," this would ensure fair wages , safe working conditions and - additionally - europe would be able to force the multinational companies to implement correct and holistic policies and would also be in a position to make a greater difference on environmental issues such as global warming .
",
9647,0,," sovereignty becomes less relevant when effective independence is lost anyway as the economy and the problems faced by all nations are increasingly globalised .
",
9648,0,," federalism and subsidiarity , that things should be dealt with at the lowest , most local , level possible , can allow for regional identities in a way national states can not .
",
9649,0,," for example for northern ireland , corsica , basque region , lombardy .
",
9650,0,," in a federal europe such peoples would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long-running conflicts could be resolved , as issues of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structures .
",
9651,1,,"the international monetary fund (imf) is an intergovernmental organization that was set up into oversee the global financial system by keeping in check its members’ balance of payments and the strength of their currency.
",
9652,1,," it hasmembers to date.
",
9653,1,," it also offers loans, mainly to its poorer members, that are usually accompanied by firm requirements to implement neoliberal economic policies, like cutting public spending and lowering corporate tax rates to balance budgets and reduce deficits.
",
9654,1,," the members of the imf have different numbers of votes, according to their ‘quotas’, which are calculated according to the financial contributions they make to the fund and their share of the world economy.
",
9655,1,,"  the imf’s main governing organ is an executive board comprised ofexecutive directors,directly appointed by the five states with the largest quotas (us, japan, germany, france, uk), andelected by the rest of the member states.
",
9656,1,," the executive board has the task of confirming the selection for managing director, the head of the imf.
",
9657,1,," due to a historical agreement, a european has always held this role, with the second in command from the united states.
",
9658,1,," however, this convention is increasingly being called into question, as well as the western countries’ dominant share of the total number of votes and decision-making powers within the organization.
",
9659,0,,"the proposal is to reweigh the quota system, ensuring the balance of power reflects the growth in the share of world economic activity now accounted for by brics and formerly developing countries.
",
9660,0,,"the decisions taken by the imf have a deep impact on the entire global financial system and on developing countries in particular , whose economies are especially sensitive to global changes .
",
9661,0,," yet , the western , developed countries have the greatest sway in the decision-making process , with developing countries having little influence over the process .
",
9662,0,," it creates an unjust financial world order , where rich and powerful countries call the shots and smaller , poorer ones bear the consequences .
",
9663,0,," claims that power within the imf is distributed according to the reality of the members ' weight in the global financial system are inaccurate .
",
9664,0,," the imf reflects the financial system as it wasyears ago and has done little to acknowledge the growth of countries like brazil , russia , india , and china , brics , which have far fewer votes than their economic heft merits , while western countries like belgium are actually overrepresented .
",
9665,0,," significant reforms to the voting quotas need to be implemented in order to create an imf that is true to the reality of the world financial system .
",
9666,0,," western dominance leads to economic policies and loan conditions rooted in neoliberal economic principles , like austerity measures , which overemphasize cutting public spending .
",
9667,0,," these often actually end up badly hurting developing economies , increasing inequalities and poverty , malawi is a prominent example .
",
9668,0,," argentina 's economic collapse attests to that .
",
9669,0,," since western countries do not suffer from food shortages , they do not understand how vital food and access to healthcare is for survival in the developing world .
",
9670,0,," the imf treats food and healthcare in its policies just like any other commodity on the market , sometimes with disastrous humanitarian consequences .
",
9671,1,,"the european union (eu) currently hasmember countries, twelve of which have joined since the new millennium.
",
9672,1,," since this large expansion further expansion, with the exception of debates over turkey, has been a much smaller issue.
",
9673,1,," the european union has offered the prospect of membership in the eu to nine countries; albania, bosnia and herzegovina, croatia, former yugoslav republic of (fyro) macedonia, iceland, kosovo, montenegro, serbia, and turkey.
",
9674,1,," of these five, croatia, fyro macedonia, iceland, montenegro, and turkey, have been granted official candidate status.
",
9675,1,," however negotiations have only opened with croatia, iceland and turkey.
",
9676,1,,"however the european union itself is in crisis.
",
9677,1,," since the financial crisis inthe periphery of europe has been running in to financial problems.
",
9678,1,," greece, ireland and portugal within the core group in the euro single currency have been bailed out and there are still worries that much larger economies like spain or italy may at some point also need a bailout.
",
9679,1,," already there have been other eu states that are non-members of the euro that have also been bailed out such as hungary which was bailed out by the eu and international monetary fund in 2008.
",
9680,1,," as a result europe has little money or time left over for considering further expansion, does it really want to be expanding when there is crisis at home?
",
9681,1,,"none the less the question of expansion of the european union remains important in the long term.
",
9682,1,," many european countries have declining populations or soon will have so new workers are needed.
",
9683,1,," expansion is at the heart of the european project – there has always been a drive to either make europe deeper or broader.
",
9684,1,," the criteria for membership are simple and would eventually allow for quite a lot more expansion eastwards.
",
9685,1,," articleof the treaty on european union makes the eus founding principles “of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law” the main criteria along with being a european country.
",
9686,1,," this was reaffirmed and expanded upon in the copenhagen criteria ofthat required a candidate to have1, stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;2, a functioning market economy, as well as the ability to cope with the pressure of competition and the market forces at work inside the union;3, the ability to assume the obligations of membership, in particular adherence to the objectives of political, economic and monetary union.
",
9687,0,,"once states have passed these criteria then they need to go through an accession process in which the candidate country implements eu legislation and puts eu rules and procedures in place.
",
9688,0,,"it is right to extend the economic and political benefits enjoyed by existing eu members to the rest of europe .
",
9689,0,," states in eastern europe are still recovering from the `` dead hand '' of communist rule imposed after deals between the ussr and the usa and britain at the end of world war ii .
",
9690,0,," many within the boundaries of the former soviet union such as belarus and increasingly ukraine have reverted to more authoritarian governments .
",
9691,0,," these states should not be abandoned by their western neighbours .
",
9692,0,," europe has just as much responsibility to those states within europe that have so far been left out the european union 's enlargement as it did to those countries of central and eastern europe that were accepted in the most recent enlargements .
",
9693,0,," expansion means extending a project which has ensured unprecedented levels of peace and cooperation among former enemies in western europe for nearly half a century .
",
9694,0,," this was the original purpose of the european project .
",
9695,0,," the european union started out as the european coal and steel community which shared these important strategic resources that were necessary to fight a war .
",
9696,0,," it was argued that this integration is the only way to keep france and germany , enemies that had fought three wars in the previous eighty years , from attacking each other .
",
9697,0,," entrenching peace , democracy and economic integration throughout the continent is to the benefit of all european nations , the most recent two wars ; world war i and world war ii expanded to include the whole of europe and much of the rest of the world .
",
9698,0,," the european union also means that there is no concern that there will be conflict .
",
9699,0,," this both allows members of the european union to spend less on defence -- only the uk , france and greece meet nato 's% of gdp targetand frees up european forces for peacekeeping missions such as those in the in the western balkans in bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia , but also further afield , for exampletroops were deployed as an eu force in chad in 2008-9 .
",
9700,0,," the current economic crisis within europe masks its immense success in turning new member states into prosperous economies while also benefiting those who were already members .
",
9701,0,," betweenandtrade between the new and old member states grew frombillion euros tobillion , this outweighs the cost of eu financial assistance to the new members which only amounts to between 0.2-0 .3 % of eu gdp .
",
9702,0,," for example british exports to thenew member states were worth # 11.6 billion incompared to # 4.5 billion inwhereas the dutch government estimates that the benefits of enlargement to each of its inhabitants waseuros .
",
9703,0,," admitting new members is also necessary over the long term in order to counter the aging that is occurring in europe .
",
9704,0,," every member of the european union has an aging population and a fertility rate below the replacement rate of 2.1 .
",
9705,0,," encouraging economic growth in countries that are old and getting older is difficult because they are less inclined to take risks and be innovative .
",
9706,0,," this means that europe needs more young workers ; these can be gained either through immigration from the rest of the world or through admitting more vibrant economies into the european union .
",
9707,0,," turkey is a good example of the kind of country the eu needs to allow to join ; its economy is growing rapidly , even faster than china 's in the first half of, and the median age of the population is still only.
",
9708,0,," the prospect of joining the eu has been an impetus for reform in many ex-communist countries , driving changes , e.g. legal reforms , privatizations , human rights , that are desirable in their own right .
",
9709,0,," the progress made in a few years by the first wave of eastern european states to join the european union was impressive and membership was their deserved reward .
",
9710,0,," conversely , if the prospect of eu membership was now denied to those states that are still hoping to join in the future , these states are likely to be unwilling to implement the unpopular reforms that the european union would like .
",
9711,0,," even in countries that are not on any eu lists of applicant or potential members the door to enlargement has a positive influence .
",
9712,0,," the prospect of joining the european union has tempted even those who might naturally be inclined to look the other way .
",
9713,0,," viktor yanukovych was the pro-russian candidate in ukraine yet he has continued on the path towards eu membership since taking office for example creating the legislation necessary for an eu-ukraine free trade zone .
",
9714,0,," enlargement is a unique opportunity to encourage nations to take a path which will lead them to becoming prosperous developed democracies .
",
9715,0,," most states are unwilling to accept lectures on where they are going wrong and would , like russia has for example done , accuse western nations of violations against its sovereignty if there are attempts to encourage civil society , democracy or more westernized economies .
",
9716,0,," vladimir putin has many times made statements referring to western ngo such as `` the activities of `` pseudo-ngos '' and other agencies that try to destabilize other countries with outside support are unacceptable . ''
",
9717,0,," however these are much more palatable if the end result is membership in the european union and the reforms are accompanied by european expertise and money , per-accession assistance currently totals 12.9 billion euros .
",
9718,1,,"syria, a relatively small but pivotal middle eastern country, has been on a downward spiral since marchwhen there were peaceful street protests calling for the president, bashar al assad, to step down.
",
9719,1,," assad responded with force, firing on the protestors in daara on 21st march, and within a week demonstrations and some clashes in six of the twelve provincial capitals.
",
9720,1,," quelling daara with force was followed in late april with violent clashes in homs which in turn escalated nationwide on aprilwhen more thandemonstrators were killed across the country.
",
9721,1,," some among the protestors responded to force with force and formed the free syrian army at the end of july whose organisation was enhanced by defections from the syrian army.
",
9722,1,," peace attempts have failed and the country is now involved in a full scale civil war between rebel groups, that want to overthrow the government as inspired by the other arab spring revolutions, and assad's government.
",
9723,1,," the civil war is compounded by the fault lines that run through syria's history, the government is supported by a shi'ite sect called the alawites, that have historically been a persecuted minority but under bashar's father, hafez who was president fromto 2000, they rose to prominence.
",
9724,1,," sunnis, the majority, want to return to political dominance, but these are not the only two groups, there are also christians and kurds who both have reason to fear a sunni return too dominance and worry there will be no place for them in a post-assad syria.
",
9725,1,,"the european union imposed sanctions from 10th maywith further restrictions inpreventing any export of arms to syria.
",
9726,1,," yet both sides have been armed; the assad by russia and syria, and the rebels by saudi arabia and qatar.
",
9727,1,," western states, unlike in libya, have so far been unwilling to take any action.
",
9728,1,," however in march 2013, two years after the start of the conflict, david cameron, prime minister of the united kingdom, and francois hollande, president of france urged the european union to lift its arms embargo but the rest of europe was unmoved.
",
9729,1,," the obama administration has so far also been unwilling to take any steps beyond the diplomatic; the white house has overruled a plan to arm moderate groups of the free syrian army that was backed by much of the washington foreign policy and security establishment including secretary of state hillary clinton, secretary of defence leon panetta, chairman of the joint chiefs martin dempsey, and cia director david patraeus.
",
9730,1,," should obama have gone along with the establishment’s plan?
",
9731,0,," the assad regime has clearly lost its legitimacy and has precipitated a humanitarian crisis in syria .
",
9732,0,," the february estimate ofkilled is up from an estimate ofonly a month before , so clearly the violence is escalating .
",
9733,0,," the conflict is also affecting neighbours ; refugees have flooded into jordan , lebanon , and turkey , and israel is already believed to have attacked a convoy or research facility involved in chemical and biological weapons development .
",
9734,0,," clearly the presence of these weapons show how much worse the situation could get if assad is not overthrown .
",
9735,0,," not intervening risks the whole region being slowly destabilised and drawn in to the conflict .
",
9736,0,," democracies should support moderate groups seeking to oust dictators because the result will hopefully be a moderate , democratic state .
",
9737,0,," this would then be a reliable partner for the future that would be more willing to help engage and resolve the region 's problems .
",
9738,0,," but this is not all about being high minded and wanting to promote democracy in the middle east , arms need to be provided in order to ensure future influence in syria .
",
9739,0,," we already know that there are jihadis operating in syria so it is plain that this is a conflict that will eventually have wider implications for the west .
",
9740,0,," if we want to have influence in syria after assad is overthrown then we need to begin helping opposition groups .
",
9741,0,," it is in our interest to build up the moderate groups so as to deny support to the extremists ; once this is over we would be in a much better position if we have grateful friends on the ground rather than groups who are resentful that we provided fine words but no real help .
",
9742,0,," we do n't want to find ourselves having to root out terrorists from the air using uavs .
",
9743,0,," the syrian army is one of the biggest armies in the world ; it is nothing like the poorly equipped libyan army that was beaten by western backed rebels in.
",
9744,0,," the government has aircraft , and helicopters that are used to bomb the rebels , and heavy russian built tanks that are impervious to most of the small arms the free syrian army has .
",
9745,0,," providing arms would quickly even the odds ; light anti-tank weapons would be effective against syrian armoured vehicles repeating the success with which hezbollah employed them when they knocked out sixty israeli armoured vehicles in, while man portable air defence systems would quickly make the skies too dangerous for the syrian airforce so protecting free syrian controlled areas from the threat of attack from the air .
",
9746,0,," syria 's government has been receiving outside support from a variety of sources ; russia and iran being the most prominent .
",
9747,0,," iran has been training the jaysh al - shabi , a syrian government-controlled force modelled on iran 's basij militia .
",
9748,0,," far from just providing weapons , both iran and hezbollah from lebanon have been sending fighters to support the syrian government .
",
9749,0,," the rebels have received some support for qatar and saudi arabia but not to the extent the syrian government has .
",
9750,0,," anyone with an interest in the free syrian cause should realise that they can not do so simply by sitting on their hands expecting a victory when those doing the fighting are only provided diplomatic support .
",
9751,0,," the best solution would be a ceasefire between the two sides in the syrian civil war and a negotiated settlement , but it is clear we are long past the point where this approach stood a chance of success .
",
9752,0,," the united nations peace effort under kofi annan failed in the middle of last year and there has been no progress since .
",
9753,0,," similarly all attempts to bring pressure to bear throughout the security council have failed as a result of russia supporting assad 's regime .
",
9754,0,," this leaves the unilateral initiatives to help the rebels .
",
9755,0,," no state wants full intervention as france did in mali so the only alternative is simply to help the free syrian army .
",
9756,0,," to do so means providing what they need to win the conflict ; primarily arms that can defeat the syrian army .
",
9757,0,," this need not be considered to be exclusive with diplomacy ; the intervening state should continue to try to find a diplomatic solution just as before the dayton accords nato helped the croats militarily while at the same time looking to diplomacy to provide an overall solution to the conflict .
",
9758,1,,"sanctions are coercive or punitive actions taken on specific states.
",
9759,1,," sanctions range from diplomatic sanctions, which often result in the closing of embassies, to military sanctions, which can include intervention, and economic sanctions, which limit sectors of the target state's economy.
",
9760,1,," trade sanctions are typically imposed by either one country (unilateral) or a group of countries (multilateral) to limit their trade of certain products with another country.
",
9761,1,," often sanctions are used in international politics in an effort to push countries towards, or away from, specific actions.
",
9762,1,," the use of sanctions is a long standing debate in the field of international politics.
",
9763,1,," it centers on the idea of democracy promotion and whether it is just to punish countries that violate the human rights of their citizens or stray from democratic principles.
",
9764,1,," further, it is questioned whether sanctions are in fact the best way to ensure democratic development, or if incentives, like free trade, are more effective.
",
9765,1,," it is embodied by the expression ""the carrot or the stick;"" incentives, or punishment.
",
9766,1,," this case is generic and the arguments are broadly applicable to numerous examples: us policy towards cuba and haiti, iraq and the un, myanmar and the west, china and the wto, south african and the end of apartheid, turkey and the eu and pakistan and the commonwealth.
",
9767,0,," note the range of scenarios covered in this case.
",
9768,0,,"arms embargos are a type of sanction that specifically target types of weapons .
",
9769,0,," if a country is being particularly violent towards its people or at risk of civil war , arms embargos can be used to decrease the weapons available to the government or the people .
",
9770,0,," in 1993-1994 an arms embargo was placed on haiti by the united nations after a military coup by the group fadh , the forces armarmées d’haiti .
",
9771,0,," forces were estimated to shrink fromtoby the time the us invaded inthanks to the arms embargo .
",
9772,0,," preventing governments from attaining weapons can be the most effective way of stopping government violence .
",
9773,0,," if they do n't have weapons to arm their military , civil war and genocide become more difficult to perpetrate .
",
9774,0,," arms embargoes have been successful and when used in conjunction with other policy actions can be an effective way of addressing fears of civil war , ethnic cleansing , government violence , and coups .
",
9775,1,,"for decades, the israeli-palestinian conflict has revolved around one particularly pointed question and debate: should the palestinian people be given their own state, or is a two-state solution to the conflict the best idea among the various alternatives?
",
9776,1,," barack obama explicitly supports a two-state solution, saying that ""a two-state solution is the only solution"".
",
9777,1,," while many in israel and elsewhere oppose the idea, the two-state solution is considered the consensus solution under discussion by the key parties to the conflict, most recently at the annapolis conference in november 2007.
",
9778,0,," while alternatives exist (such as a one-state solution or forms of autonomy under the status quo) palestinian, israeli, and global leaders are primarily engaged in the debate surrounding a two-state solution.
",
9779,0,,"palestinians and israelis will not be able to live together in peace in the same state any time in the foreseeable future .
",
9780,0,," the idea that palestinians and israelis can live in peace and harmony in one state , with tolerance for each other and in keeping with democratic principles of inclusion , is simply naive .
",
9781,0,," this idea has been made impossible by nearly a century of direct conflict between these people .
",
9782,0,," while this might change in coming centuries , it is unacceptable to adopt a one-state policy now based on these naive ideas .
",
9783,0,," israeli president shimon peres has argued : `` establishing a single multinational country is a tenuous path that does not bode well for peace but , rather , enforces the conflict 's perpetuation .
",
9784,0,," lebanon , ravaged by bloodshed and instability , represents only one of many examples of an undesirable quagmire of this nature . ''
",
9785,0,,"  this stance has been endorsed by leaders and officials from around the world : us special envoy george mitchell has stated `` in the case of the israeli-palestinian conflict , we believe that the two-state solution , two states living side by side in peace , is the best and the only way to resolve this conflict . ''
",
9786,0,,"  pope benedict xvi has similarly called on israel 's leadership to embrace the two-state solution for peace with the palestinians : `` i plead with all those responsible to explore every possible avenue in the search for a just resolution of the outstanding difficulties , so that both peoples may live in peace in a homeland of their own , within secure and internationally recognized borders . ''
",
9787,0,,"  even colonel gaddafi , the late libyan leader , argued that a two-state solution was essential for peace .
",
9788,0,,"  the reason the two-state solution has been recognised as the best for peace is because it respects the democratic will of both peoples for a state of their own .
",
9789,0,," as peres argues , `` the jewish people want and deserve to live in peace in their rightful , historical homeland .
",
9790,0,," the palestinian people want and deserve their own land , their own political institutions and their right to self-determination .
",
9791,0,," it is vital that this cause be based on the prospect of coexistence between jews and arabs , which translates into cooperation in fields such as the economy , tourism , the environment and defence .
",
9792,0,," achieving all this will be possible only by granting each people its own state and borders , to enable their citizens to pray according to their faiths , cultivate their cultures , speak their own languages and safeguard their heritages . ''
",
9793,0,,"  because only a two-state solution allows for this peaceful co-existence and development , a two-state solution is best for peace and thus more justified than a one-state solution .
",
9794,0,," as described in the above quote by peres , the vast majority of israelis desire to live in a jewish homeland in which they can define their own institutions and culture in light of their jewish heritage .
",
9795,0,," a one-state solution , however , would undermine israel 's legitimacy and internationally recognized right to exist as a sovereign jewish state in the land of the jewish forefathers .
",
9796,0,," from israel 's perspective , it is not possible for the jewish people to accept an arrangement that signifies the end of the existence of a jewish state , which would be the result of a one-state solution , as the state could not be considered a jewish one if it housed a very large palestinian population , possibly even a palestinian majority .
",
9797,0,,"  for this reason it is unlikely that any one-state solution would be truly democratic , and rather would be a situation of an israeli minority ruling over a palestinian majority , who would be largely excluded from the running of the country and determining their own affairs .
",
9798,0,,"  a one-state solution would only produce an explosive situation in which jews would dominate the economy and most other aspects of the new state , creating a reality of exploitation .
",
9799,0,," at that point in time , the new state would be a new form of occupation that would only set the conflict on a more violent track .
",
9800,0,,"  therefore , the new state created by a one-state solution would be unacceptable either to israelis or to palestinians , as it would cease to be either jewish or democratic , and so would not be a just outcome .
",
9801,0,," only a two-state solution can keep israel jewish and democratic , and allow a palestinian state similarly to be arab and democratic , as it would most likely wish .
",
9802,0,," a two-state solution can offer sufficient territory for both israelis and palestinians .
",
9803,0,," for israel this would mean keeping the vast majority of areas inhabited by israeli citizens within the state of israel .
",
9804,0,," the two-state solution would also , however , offer sufficient land to the palestinians .
",
9805,0,," while cynics might question the size of the west bank and gaza , optimists should look no further than singapore for reassurance .
",
9806,0,," the area of the west bank and gaza is nine times as large as singapore 's , yet the combined population of palestinians in both regions is smaller than that of singapore .
",
9807,0,," singapore enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world .
",
9808,0,," the palestinians are capable of achieving similar success , through instituting a modern economy based on science , technology and the benefits of peace .
",
9809,0,,"  moreover , throughout the years polls have consistently showed respectable israeli and palestinian majorities in favour of a negotiated two-state settlement .
",
9810,0,,"  even the iranian president mahmud ahmadinezhad has stated that iran would support a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
",
9811,0,," the success of a two-state solution , therefore , would , at a minimum , gain the support and possibly cooperation of the iranians .
",
9812,0,," this would be valuable diplomatically , particularly in resolving the larger conflict between iran and the west .
",
9813,0,,"  therefore , the best way to satisfy both sides and achieve peace is to adopt a two-state solution , which is therefore the most just solution .
",
9814,1,,"during one of the democratic primary debates leading up thepresidential election, then senator barack obama was asked whether he would meet with the leaders of iran, syria, venezuela, and cuba, without preconditions.
",
9815,1,," obama said that “i would.
",
9816,1,," and the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this [the bush] administration – is ridiculous.”
",
9817,1,," his response drew criticisms from foreign policy commentators and political opponents, with hillary clinton deeming his response “irresponsible and naïve.”
",
9818,1,," others, however, hailed it as the advent of a new foreign policy of engagement, in stark contrast to what they saw as the diplomatic failure of the bush years.
",
9819,1,," although president obama has yet to sit down with any of the aforementioned leaders, he did reiterate his willingness to do so after he took office.
",
9820,1,," should president obama pursue this approach in his relations with “rogue nations”, or should preconditions be essential in earning them a spot at the negotiating table?
",
9821,1,," with iran allegedly developing nuclear weapons, syria in turmoil, and nuclear north korea experiencing a change in leadership, the answer to these questions is of the utmost importance for us foreign policy.
",
9822,0,," from its early days , the obama administration has strived to change the tide of us foreign policy , by moving away from america 's unilateralism and dismissiveness of other nations .
",
9823,0,," its treatment of its foes is a product of that same attitude .
",
9824,0,," the general policy not to meet or negotiate without preconditions is akin to dangling a spot at the table like some sort of prize that foreign leaders need to work for .
",
9825,0,," in international law , all states are sovereign and equal with no one having a right to interfere with other 's internal affairs .
",
9826,0,," this means that all leaders should treat each other with respect and deference .
",
9827,0,," no government is monolithic .
",
9828,0,," in every regime there will be moderate forces willing to use diplomacy and negotiations and extremist elements that do not .
",
9829,0,," by demanding that preconditions be fulfilled before a meeting , all power is given to the extremists .
",
9830,0,," israel-palestine is an example of this .
",
9831,0,," by often demanding that violence cease before negotiations can take place , the us and israel give a veto over negotiations to hamas , who are the perpetrators of violence .
",
9832,0,," they get to decide if and when negotiations take place .
",
9833,0,," instead , the president of the united states should always try to engage and strengthen moderates within these regimes .
",
9834,0,," no country is likely to agree to conditions that will significantly reduce its bargaining power once it gets to the table .
",
9835,0,," it would be diplomatically foolish to agree to preconditions that would essentially be the subject of the negotiations and the reason why the negotiations were needed in the fist place .
",
9836,0,," if north korea agreed to freeze development of its nuclear arsenal , or if iran agreed to stop its nuclear enrichment programme , once the meeting between the two leaders took place , the position from which they started negotiating would be significantly weaker than the us 's .
",
9837,0,," if , in order to meet with his counterpart , a ` rogue leader ' needs to compromise on his and his country 's position even before he gets to the table , this would be a signal of weakness to his opponents at home and those vying for his job .
",
9838,0,," for example , in north korea , which is going through a dynastic transition , the new leader kim jong un is yet to become established and consolidate his status as dictator .
",
9839,0,," any concession to the sate 's designated mortal enemy , the us , might jeopardise the succession .
",
9840,0,," similarly , in iran where ahmadinejad has fallen from the graces of the supreme religious leader , the ayatollah , agreeing to preconditions in order to get a meeting with obama would signal to the iranian president 's rivals that it may be a good moment to attempt to force a change of guard .
",
9841,0,," preconditions delay engagement and negotiations .
",
9842,0,," sometimes it can take years before the parties even start talking to each other .
",
9843,0,," in that time , iran will continue to enrich uranium and north korea will continue to expand its nuclear arsenal .
",
9844,0,," if the us waits for preconditions to be agreed on and met , by the time president obama gets to talk and negotiate directly with the leaders of these states , he will have a much bigger crisis to deal with .
",
9845,0,," it may have even gotten to the point where diplomacy can no longer be used effectively .
",
9846,1,,"fidel castro and his communist government came to power in cuba in 1959, much to the horror of the american administration of the time.
",
9847,1,," cuba was supported throughout the cold war by the soviet union and became a flashpoint for cold war tensions, notably during the bay of pigs invasion and the cuban missile crisis when nikita khrushchev sparked the most dangerous cold war confrontation by attempting to place nuclear weapons on the island.
",
9848,1,,"america has maintained near total sanctions on cuba throughout the period since 1959, but beforethey were largely counteracted in their effects by the weight of support, trade and subsidy offered by the ussr, which amounted to $4-6 billion dollars per year.
",
9849,1,," since the collapse of the soviet bloc the withdrawal of these subsidies caused a 35% drop in gdp, which was partly reversed after late 1990s market reforms that focused on foreign investment and tourism, as well as allowing some self-employment but living conditions remain belowlevels.
",
9850,1,,"  aftersome of these tentative reforms were rolled back, while cuba began to benefit from its alliance with venezuela, which gives it oil in exchange for doctors and teachers.
",
9851,1,," fidel castro stepped down from formal power in 2006, handing over to his brother who has recently announced further liberalising economic reforms, while political control has been maintained.
",
9852,1,,"nevertheless, the poverty of cuba makes it much more vulnerable to the effects of sanctions than it was.
",
9853,1,," the decreased threat of communism has led to a re-evaluation of the sanctions in the us but so far the wounds of the twentieth century, and the electoral significance of florida, where most cuban émigrés live, has steeled the resolve of the white house.
",
9854,1,," sanctions were in fact strengthened significantly in the helms-burton act of 1996, although some food and medicines were still allowed through under the bush administration.
",
9855,1,," announcements by the obama administration inshould make it easier for us citizens to travel to cuba and to send remittances to relatives there, and have been much criticised by opposition politicians and some cuban-american lobby groups.
",
9856,0,," the sanctions cause real and unacceptable harm to the cuban people .
",
9857,0,," sanctions deprive cuba of low cost food that the united states could provide so hitting the poorest yet they do not affect the ruling elite .
",
9858,0,," in the's cuba lost $billion in trade and $ 1.2 billion in international loans because of u.s. sanctions .
",
9859,0,," cuba is too poor a country not to suffer from these losses .
",
9860,0,," the dominance of america in the pharmaceuticals industry , moreover , means that it is actually impossible for cubans to gain access to many drugs and other medical equipment , including the only curative treatment for some pediatric leukemias .
",
9861,0,," america would be the natural market for most cuban products , and its refusal to accept goods with even the tiniest cuban inputs from third nations damages cuba 's ability to trade with others .
",
9862,0,," other south american countries have shown their reliance on the types of loans that cuba is denied in the last few years to keep their economies on track .
",
9863,0,," sanctions are pointless and counterproductive .
",
9864,0,," they 've made no political difference in the lastyears , why would they now ?
",
9865,0,," they mean that the us can be blamed for all the failures of the cuban economy and to justify repressive measures for security , and therefore encourage the retrenchment of both .
",
9866,0,," in times when the cuban economy is booming , as inwhen the economy grew by% , the impotence of the sanctions becomes clear .
",
9867,0,," president bush claimed to want to empower civil society in cuba but he also argued that the best way to achieve this in china was to trade and spread ` american values . '
",
9868,0,," cuba 's geographical and cultural proximity makes it very likely to change quickly when they are able to freely interact with the united states through travel and trade .
",
9869,0,," sanctions on cuba are illegal and damage america 's international standing .
",
9870,0,," they violate the un charter , laws on the freedom of navigation , and repeated united nations resolutions since, passed with only the us and israel in opposition .
",
9871,0,," furthermore , some parts of the helms-burton act are extra-territorial in their effects on businessmen from third nations and therefore cause significant protest around the world .
",
9872,0,," this makes a mockery of the us claim to be a guardian of international law , not only in its dealings with cuba but also in the negotiations over the future of iraq .
",
9873,0,," america could achieve its goals internationally more easily if it was not marked with evidence of its lack of respect for international law .
",
9874,0,," the united states will also benefit from the opening of trade with cuba economically .
",
9875,0,," mid-western republicans have all voted to drop the embargo because of the potential for profits in their farming states .
",
9876,0,," even the modest opening of the embargo inhas increased sales of farm products immensely having gone from nothing to $million in.
",
9877,0,," this is a market for american products as well as a local producer .
",
9878,0,," further , if sanctions end americans will be able to stop pretending that they prefer bolivian cigars !
",
9879,0,," sanctions are not the will of the american people but of a small minority of embittered cuban americans in florida who are being pandered to due to their importance in elections in a swing state .
",
9880,0,," congressman charles rangel argues that the only success of the sanctions policy has been to `` appease the republican constituency in florida '' .
",
9881,0,," national opinion generally expresses no preference or opposes the ban , in acbs poll asking `` do you think the united states should or should not re-establish diplomatic and trade relations with cuba ? ''
",
9882,0,," 67 % said should .
",
9883,0,," sanctions remaining in place is electioneering government at its worst , domestic interest groups controlling government foreign policy .
",
9884,0,," as karl rove has admitted `` when people mention cuba to me , it makes me think of three things : florida , florida , and florida . ''
",
9885,1,,"debt relief is often discussed as a possible solution to world poverty.
",
9886,1,," given the over 34% of the world’s population still live in poverty on less than $2 per day, the international community, and more specifically the g8 group consisting of the most powerful nations in the world, made poverty relief one of the main goals during the un’s millennium meeting in 2000.
",
9887,1,," in looking for solutions for world poverty, debt relief is often seen as an important element and has thus sparked the creation of initiatives such as the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (hipc).
",
9888,1,," this addresses some of the world’s poorest nations that face an unsustainable debt burden and seeks to provide debt relief or complete debt cancellation in exchange for economic and political reforms.
",
9889,1,,"of the world’s poorest countries already benefit from this initiative.
",
9890,1,,"in 2005, at the urging of british prime minister tony blair, the g8 summit revisited the issue of debt relief as a way to rid the world from poverty.
",
9891,1,," an agreement was reached to provide more aid as well as debt relief to poverty-stricken countries.
",
9892,1,," the agreement erased the debt ofof the world’s poorest nations (mainly in sub-saharan africa).
",
9893,1,," 70% of this debt was owed to the world bank and the remaining debt was owed to the imf and the african development bank.
",
9894,1,," debt relief for countries affected by natural disasters - such as the asian tsunami, the kashmir earthquake and the mozambique floods – is also being discussed as part of this larger debt relief initiative.
",
9895,1,," the united nations has been very supportive of debt relief.
",
9896,0,," debt relief is much needed for the world 's poorest nations and the only way to ensure that they get back on the road to economic development .
",
9897,0,," without debt relief , the cycle of poverty , disease and corruption would continue and possibly spread to other parts of the world .
",
9898,0,," debt relief is particularly needed in countries affected by natural disasters , where much of the aid is focused on solving immediate concerns as opposed to getting the economy back on track .
",
9899,0,," not only do they desperately need more money to cope with the disaster , but the economic impact of the tragedy reduces their ability to service their loans anyway .
",
9900,0,," what is the point of the developed world promising hundreds of millions of dollars in post-disaster aid , if they then take away much more money each year in debt charges ?
",
9901,0,," a cancelling of debt is a mechanism that dates back to antiquity as a means of ` resetting ' power and wealth inequalities that have expanded to critical levels .
",
9902,0,," normally debt-relief schemes are accused of creating a moral hazard - encouraging governments of poor countries to spend their revenues unwisely in the expectation that creditor nations will wipe out their debts if they get into trouble .
",
9903,0,," debt relief for countries affected by natural disasters is different , as by their very nature such events are unpredictable and can not be planned for .
",
9904,0,," instead the possibility of such assistance in the event of an earthquake , tidal wave , or other disaster makes it more possible for developing states to plan ahead and invest wisely for the future .
",
9905,0,," debt burdens are common in the developing world , but natural disasters such as earthquakes , tsunamis or hurricanes are rare and unpredictable .
",
9906,0,," existing debt-reduction programmes take a long-term approach , but years of good policy and improving governance can be totally wrecked by one event .
",
9907,0,," for example cyclone nargis incaused immense damage to myanmar 's , burma , economy with disaster costs amounting to nearly% of gdp , something that would immensely strain even the best managed country .
",
9908,0,," people who have the misfortune to live in badly-run or totalitarian states still deserve our help when disaster strikes .
",
9909,0,," debt-relief is one way for the international community to make sure they are not oppressed from without , by debt charges , as well as from within .
",
9910,0,," totalitarian governments may also be more willing to accept aid if it comes with debt relief .
",
9911,1,,"the model of the nation-state has traditionally provided the basis for international relations.
",
9912,1,," however, there are many problems which are impossible for individual nation-states to solve and which require international cooperation, for example environmental problems, third world poverty, international law, trading rules, etc. and cosmopolitanism is coming back into fashion; many people consider there to be such a thing as an international society with international laws.
",
9913,1,," this has serious implications for the old nation-state model and evokes the possibility of the united nations evolving into a popularly elected ""world government"".
",
9914,1,," should (and could) such a government exist?
",
9915,1,," ‘world government’ refers to the idea of all humankind united under one common political authority.
",
9916,1,," arguably, it has not existed so far in human history, yet proposals for a unified global political authority have existed since ancient times — in the ambition of kings, popes and emperors, and the dreams of poets and philosophers.
",
9917,1,,"note: there are many possible models that can be proposed when debating motions on world government.
",
9918,1,," each model yields a slightly different debate.
",
9919,1,," here is one option:the proposed world government would represent a qualitative advance over the united nations of today.
",
9920,1,," it would comprise legislative, executive and judicial branches; its high officials would be elected by its constituent population; and it would possess its own military force and powers of taxation.
",
9921,1,," it would be federal in form, so that the identity and institutions of its member nations would be fully preserved and protected.
",
9922,1,," the voting system in the world legislature would embody a balanced separation of powers so that neither the populous poorer nations of the world nor the less populous richer nations could impose their preferences on the other.
",
9923,1,," membership in the world federation would not be obligatory on all nations, and moreover, member nations could freely depart from the world federation at any time at their own unilateral discretion.
",
9924,1,," member nations could also retain control over whatever independent armed forces they feel essential to their national interests.
",
9925,1,," the expectation is that after a sufficiently lengthy period of gradual evolution, these retained rights of the member nations would become unimportant in a practical sense.
",
9926,0,," as this happens, the world government would gradually become more authoritative and effective, while remaining democratic and benign.
",
9927,0,,"ever since the destruction of the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki induring the closing days of world war ii , the threat of global devastation through nuclear world war has hung over human civilization like a damocles ' sword .
",
9928,0,," the threat of global nuclear destruction peaked during the most perilous years of the cold war during the 1950s through the 1970s , and it gradually subsided thereafter .
",
9929,0,," with the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s , many people came to believe that the threat has entirely disappeared .
",
9930,0,," but this is false complacency .
",
9931,0,," although national arsenals of nuclear-tipped icbms have declined in the two decades since the end of the cold war , they still exist at levels that would cause unimaginable death and destruction were they unleashed in a world war .
",
9932,0,," the history of human civilization throughout the ages demonstrates the strong propensity among human beings toward hostility , violence and warfare -- whatever the potential cost .
",
9933,0,," as long as the international political system is based upon the sovereignty of nation-states , the threat of nuclear world war will always be there .
",
9934,0,," economic interaction among the nations of the world , in the form of trade , investment and migration , has reached such a point today that it is meaningful to think of `` the world economy . ''
",
9935,0,," economic globalization suggests the need for political globalization in the form of a world government .
",
9936,0,," following the seminal work of john maynard keynes during the great depression of the 1930s , it has become widely accepted within the economics profession that a certain amount of interventionist national government policy is essential to maintaining a proper balance between the twin economic evils of unemployment and inflation .
",
9937,0,," just as judicious national anticyclical policy is beneficial to national economies , so too a judicious world anticyclical policy , as implemented by a functioning world government , would be beneficial to the world economy .
",
9938,0,," a world government would also improve the overall functioning of the global economy by means of regularizing various circumstances of international economic interaction , for example , in the area of patents and copyrights , and by working to reduce various trade impediments , such as tariffs and quotas , imposed by national governments .
",
9939,0,," a world government would enhance the probability that effective means will be developed and implemented toward ameliorating the global problems of resource depletion and environmental decay .
",
9940,0,," in a world divided into a host of jealously independent and self-righteously sovereign nations , national leaders tend to point the finger of blame for these problems at other nations , and to resist international efforts toward resource conservation and environmental preservation .
",
9941,0,," as the mutual accusations and recriminations go on and on , the problems are left to fester .
",
9942,0,," if a world government existed , it might muster sufficient respect and possess sufficient authority to enable the nations to arrive at a workable consensus on how to share equitably the short-term costs and inconveniences necessary to securing long-term sustainability of resources and preservation of environmental quality .
",
9943,0,," a world government would give people a higher focus for their political loyalties than their respective nation-states , and thus facilitate the development of a higher degree of cosmopolitanism than is possible under the sovereign nation-state system .
",
9944,0,," this would benefit the practical operations and effectiveness of the world government .
",
9945,0,," the greater the sense of community among the citizens of a polity , the higher the effectiveness of the polity 's government , and the higher the effectiveness of the polity 's government , the greater the sense of community among its citizens .
",
9946,0,," this suggests an interactive , snowballing relationship over time between the sense of community of the citizens of the world federation , and the efficiency and effectiveness of its practical operations .
",
9947,0,," from relatively low sense of community and low effectiveness in its early stages , over many years of gradual evolution , the world federation would eventually achieve a very high level of community spirit and practical effectiveness .
",
9948,0,," the history of the european union , eu , in the post-world war ii era provides an encouraging example of what might be done at the global level through a functioning world government .
",
9949,0,," it is widely agreed among economists that the relatively high degree of prosperity and security enjoyed today by the people of the western european nations is in no small measure the result of the gradual evolution from the original limited-purpose , six-member european coal and steel community , ecsc , to the general-purpose , 27-member eu of today .
",
9950,0,," in the early 1940s , many of the eu nations of today were locked in devastating warfare .
",
9951,0,," the fact that these same nations are today harmonious components of a quasi-state polity demonstrates the capability of people to change their customary modes of thought and behavior when there exists a sufficient incentive to do so .
",
9952,1,,"in 2010, nearly $90bn in official development assistance (oda) aid will be given by the member nations of the un’s development assistance committee (dac).
",
9953,1,," payments of this type are transferred from the governments of donor states to the governments of the recipient states; approximately 70% of this funding will be ring-fenced (set aside) for development projects.
",
9954,1,," bythe overall oda figure is estimated to rise to around $130bn.
",
9955,1,," long-term development aid consists of money, machinery, food resources and military equipment.
",
9956,1,," it may also incorporate the provision of skills and education, by legal, technical and medical professionals.
",
9957,1,,"this focuses on whether, instead of long-term government-to-government aid, world bank aid and loans should be supplied to non-governmental organisations such as christian aid, care, anuragam and engineers without borders, private voluntary organisations and microcredit or microfinance institutions.
",
9958,1,," such aid models could include ring-fencing by nation, regional or purpose quotas and a need-based or competitive bidding allocation element.
",
9959,0,," at the core of debates on this topic will be the effectiveness and efficiency of different aid delivery mechanisms.
",
9960,0,,"changing the way money is given will reduce corruption , embezzlement and manipulation .
",
9961,0,," centralised government structures control aid distribution in many recipient countries .
",
9962,0,," as a consequence , embezzlement by government officials has become more frequent and easier to conceal .
",
9963,0,," linking aid to specific projects is ineffective at solving this problem due to difficulty in tracking individual project accounts within the recipient nation .
",
9964,0,," the need to monitor which individuals and institutions receive donated funds , and to confirm that funds have been applied according to agreed plans and schedules still presents a difficult and intractable auditing problem .
",
9965,0,," not only is oda increasingly being used to incentivise compliance or non-interference with america 's objectives in the war on terror , as shown by the aid provided to pakistan for its cooperation in the stationing of us military bases .
",
9966,0,," when oda is administered in this way , there is an increased risk that recipient governments will be seen by their people as less independent -- as stooges of colonial interlopers .
",
9967,0,," similarly , state-owned resource extraction and processing firms can influence an economy 's real exchange rate , making cross border trade in the commodities produced by farmers and local craftsmen uncompetitive -- a situation known as the dutch disease .
",
9968,0,," this is a significant hazard in continents with a high proportion of interdependent sovereign states , such as africa .
",
9969,0,," the risks inherent in state supervised industry and micro-economic stimulus can be avoided by supplying aid funding to microbanking and microcredit institutions .
",
9970,0,," businesses of this type specialise in creating a large supply of low cost credit that small firms , farmers and households can borrow in order to fund the purchases and investments that will bring them closer to prosperity .
",
9971,1,,"in 1962, fourteen years after myanmar (then burma) gained independence, a military coup led by general ne win resulted in the abolition of the federal system and the creation of a single-party state.
",
9972,1,," this was coupled with the nationalisation of the economy and a ban on independent newspapers.
",
9973,1,," general ne win remained in power for twenty-six years - as military ruler until 1974, as president of the people’s assembly (appointed under a new constitution) fromto 1981, and as the head of the ruling party fromto 1988.
",
9974,1,,"in this period, poverty reached extremely high levels in myanmar.
",
9975,1,," currency devaluation inled to a massive economic crisis and anti-government riots.
",
9976,1,," another military coup inreplaced the existing political leadership and a new ruling junta came to power, which renamed burma as myanmar.
",
9977,1,,"in 1990, multi-party elections were held and the national league for democracy (nld, the main opposition party) emerged as the comprehensive winner.
",
9978,1,," however, the military junta refused to transfer power and placed nld leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest for six years.
",
9979,1,," a constitution review process was commenced, and in the subsequent years, nld members were involved in both negotiations with and protests against the ruling junta, as a result of which many nld members faced imprisonment and house arrest.
",
9980,1,,"  aung san suu kyi was placed under house arrest again formonths, released in 2002, imprisoned in 2003, and then transferred to house arrest.
",
9981,1,,"in this period, a new draft of the constitution was approved in a national referendum (2008) and electoral laws were changed in advance of elections in november 2010, which were the first elections in myanmar since 1990.
",
9982,1,," the military-backed union solidarity and development party claimed victory in these elections.
",
9983,1,," nld boycotted the process and was officially disbanded,  aung san suu kyi was prevented from participating and then released from house arrest after the elections, which were criticised for being a sham and for the occurrence of fraud.
",
9984,1,," the nld was however allowed to contestbyelections in aprilwhere the party wonof the seats.
",
9985,1,," currently, a civilian government headed by president thein sein (said to be handpicked by than shwe, the leader of the military junta) is in power, while many of the top posts are occupied by individuals who were formerly members of the military junta.1there have been large-scale violations of human rights under the military junta, including in relation to political insurgents and separatist movements.
",
9986,1,," there have also been unverified reports that myanmar may be building nuclear facilities with the help of north korea.
",
9987,1,," the united states (us) and the european union (eu) (along with canada, japan, australia and new zealand) have placed long-standing economic and political sanctions, arms embargoes, restrictions on providing aid to and trade with myanmar, though there has been some political engagement involving officials of the us government and the un.
",
9988,1,," regionally, however, myanmar has trade and political relations with its asian neighbours, continues to be a member of the asean.
",
9989,1,," therefore, the arguments below are from the perspective of the west (mainly us and eu).
",
9990,0,," ‘reengagement’ refers to the removal of economic sanctions and resumption of normal diplomatic relations with myanmar.
",
9991,0,,"the isolation of myanmar by some of the developed western powers is arbitrary and marked by hypocrisy .
",
9992,0,," the real reasons for the stance taken by these countries are political .
",
9993,0,," there is little consistency in the attitude taken towards other governments and dictatorships across the world that also have questionable human rights records , saudi arabia and egypt , to name a few , but either offer other strategic and economic benefits , or are much more influential in international affairs than myanmar .
",
9994,0,," myanmar is only part of a group of countries , also including cuba and north korea , whose economic and political policies have remained relatively opaque to arm-twisting by the us and the eu .
",
9995,0,," it is unfair to impose sanctions on and isolate myanmar on this basis , especially in an emerging multi-polar international environment .
",
9996,0,," myanmar has taken significant steps towards democratisation in the last three years .
",
9997,0,," the new constitution and the elections that resulted in the current civilian government being appointed represent a marked shift in its governance structure .
",
9998,0,," though there may be scope for improvement in its democratic framework , institutions for democratic functioning have been created and this is a huge step forward .
",
9999,0,," aung san suu kyi has also been released from house arrest , and the tone of the statements made by the new government has been a reconciliatory one .
",
10000,0,," a new human rights commission has also been established .
",
10001,0,," while the pace of reform may not match the supposed expectations of the us and the eu , myanmar 's choice to change gradually and engage with them on its own terms must be respected .
",
10002,0,," the fundamental circumstances under which a policy of limited engagement was adopted with myanmar have changed , and this calls for reassessment .
",
10003,0,," reengagement has potential for having a positive influence in various contexts .
",
10004,0,," myanmar is rich in natural resources , including forest products , minerals and gems .
",
10005,0,," removing trade restrictions and offering developmental aid would benefit the local economy and population .1 in the longer term , economic activity can act as a stimulus for development of a stronger legal and business framework to reduce corruption .
",
10006,0,," if the us and the eu create confidence in the myanmar government that they are willing to offer something constructive rather than critical , it may be possible to ask for greater transparency in government and reduce systematic violations of human rights as well .2 the newly elected civilian government has indicated it is willing to pursue democratic reform , and the us and the eu should not lose this opportunity for change .
",
10007,0,," the policy of disengagement has not resulted in any meaningful change in myanmar , politically or economically .
",
10008,0,," since myanmar has not been dependent on the us or the eu , sanctions and arms embargoes have not had any effect on the government .
",
10009,0,," the changes in 2010-2011 have been due to the influence of the nld , and certain regional players , like thailand and china , which have sought to directly engage with myanmar .
",
10010,0,," further , the sections of the population that are most affected by the sanctions are those not in the top tier of the political and economic class , but smaller manufacturers and the working class .
",
10011,0,," restrictions on exports and developmental aid from the us and the eu prevent local manufacturers and consumers from having access to them .
",
10012,0,," on the other hand , restrictions on imports from myanmar weaken the market for its exporters .
",
10013,0,," these factors only further impoverish and alienate the local population , increasing economic disparity , and consequently the power of the ruling elite in the national context as well .
",
10014,0,," myanmar has continuing economic and political relations with many other countries , including members of the asean , and significantly , china , which is also the source of a large proportion of foreign investment in myanmar .
",
10015,0,," these countries , some of which are major economic and political partners of the us and the eu , do not share the same attitude about the legitimacy of the myanmar government and the approach that should be taken towards it .
",
10016,0,," for the purposes of regional stability , it would be better for the us and the eu to align their positions with the others .
",
10017,0,," this reduces the risk of diplomatic rifts which could destabilise the region .
",
10018,0,," further , if the international community presents a united viewpoint on what steps myanmar should take to improve its democracy , such steps are more likely to be taken .
",
10019,1,,"the united nations, formed out of the horrors of the world war ii with the overarching purpose of preventing this kind of total war from ever happening again.
",
10020,1,," its formation came after the failures of the league of nations, an international organisation that had the same lofty goal of preventing war.
",
10021,1,," the un sought out to overcome the leagues failures by through embedding itself into all aspects of the international community setting up organisations such as the general assembly, security council, international court of justice, the world bank, and later on the international atomic energy agency and its development programme.
",
10022,1,," over the lastyears, the un has changed and developed, along the way it has permanently changed the environment of the international community, through its work in peacekeeping, creating and developing international law, the establishment of human rights, the list goes on.
",
10023,1,," however, in all this change some negatives have arisen, the decision making process is often very slow and many institutions like the security council are reactionary, and very easily caught up in power politics, rendering them useless at critical moments.
",
10024,0,," this raises the question that this debate is focused around- has the un failed?
",
10025,0,,"the un was set up with the express purpose of preventing global wars , yet it has done absolutely nothing to prevent them .
",
10026,0,," indeed , the un has often served merely as a forum for countries to abuse and criticise each other , rather than resolve disputes peacefully .
",
10027,0,," in some cases , such as theinvasion of iraq , un resolutions have arguably been used as a justification for wars , rather than to prevent them .
",
10028,0,," research shows that the number of armed conflicts in the world rose steadily in the years afterand has only begun to plateau or fall since the end of the cold war .
",
10029,0,," despite the development of the concept of human rights in the post-war world , the un has totally failed to protect the rights of citizens , ethnic minorities , women and children .
",
10030,0,," it has stood by during episodes of genocide in cambodia , rwanda , congo and yugoslavia among many others , tolerates some of the world 's worst dictatorships as members , and does nothing to improve the situation of women in developing nations .
",
10031,0,," indeed , where un peacekeepers have been sent into war-torn countries , they have sometimes been guilty of the most horrendous human rights abuses themselves .
",
10032,0,," as of, the un 's human rights council itself is comprised of members such as saudi arabia , cuba and china .
",
10033,0,," the un displays all the worst traits of bureaucracies the world over .
",
10034,0,," the general assembly is little more than a forum for world leaders and ambassadors to lambast each other .
",
10035,0,," the security council is systemically unable to take decisive action in many of the world 's trouble-spots due to its outdated permanent membership structure , which gives five nations a totally disproportionate power to prevent the world body from acting against their interests .
",
10036,0,," in the un 'syears , the veto has been used nearlytimes .
",
10037,0,," as mentioned above , the human rights council consists of some the worst human rights abusers in the world .
",
10038,0,," the ngo un watch has accused the hrc focusing almost exclusively on alleged human rights abuses by israel to the exclusion of almost every other country .
",
10039,0,," there have been widespread allegations of corruption in un bodies .
",
10040,0,," it is for these reasons that the us long refused to pay its full dues to the united nations and threatens to do so again in future , as well as withholding funding from unesco inafter it voted to recognise palestine as an independent state .
",
10041,0,," the major economic , political and trade issues around the world are almost all dealt with either through bilateral agreements between nations or by specialised bodies set up for that purpose -- the world bank , imf , eu , asean , nato , wto and so on .
",
10042,0,," in all of these fields the un is little more than an irrelevance .
",
10043,0,," even where the un does get involved in international affairs -- such as in the libyan crisis of-- it is other bodies , in that case nato , which serve as the vehicle for international cooperation .
",
10044,1,,"the state of bosnia & herzegovina is formally divided into two entities the republika srpska [hereafter referred to as rs] (composed primarily of ethnic serbs) and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina [fbh] (composed primarily of ethnic croats and bosnian muslims or bosniaks).
",
10045,1,," this division dates from the time of its independence from yugoslavia induring the yugoslav wars and was designed to end the fighting and promote peace and reconciliation.
",
10046,1,," the conflict was ended by the dayton agreement of 21st november 1995.
",
10047,1,," the agreement set an inter-ethnic boundary line which closely followed the front lines at the end of the war with a few adjustments particularly in the case of sarajevo.
",
10048,1,,"these two entities are largely self-governing within their own territories, with their own parliaments, presidents, constitutions, police forces and even their own postal systems.
",
10049,1,," cooperation between the two parts within federal state structures is limited and characterised by gridlock and division.
",
10050,1,,"many within the republika srpska seek independence from bosnia-herzegovina and potentially even union with serbia.
",
10051,0,," the right to self-determination is a basic human right which underpins the legitimacy of the nation-state .
",
10052,0,," where a large group people do not feel represented or accepted by a state and thus do not consent to its rule , the states control over that people becomes illegitimate .
",
10053,0,," the right to national self-determination is enshrined with the un charter and formed the basis for the independence of slovenia , croatia , macedonia , kosovo and montenegro .
",
10054,0,," kosovo became formally independent from serbia inand montenegro became independent from serbia inas a result of referenda within those territories .
",
10055,0,," if these states and the many , many others which previously achieved independence have a right to self-determination why does n't rs ?
",
10056,0,," to deny some groups of people access to self-determination is hypocritical and unjust .
",
10057,0,," the existing state structure does not work , because it requires agreement between the representatives of rs and the fbh , given the fundamentally divergent aims and opinions of the two sides compromise is almost impossible leading to perpetual gridlock on basic issues such as policing and education .
",
10058,0,," this gridlock can be shown by the fifteen months it took for bosnia and herzegovina to form a government , and even then a compromise was only reached due to financial pressure from the imf and eu .
",
10059,0,," the constituents peoples , serbs , croats and bosniaks , live almost entirely in separate segregated areas with very little communal intermixing .
",
10060,0,," they already essentially live in separate states but without the ability to actually direct their own affairs or receive international recognition .
",
10061,0,," it should be remembered that the bosnian serbs have already voted ponce for secession as in a referendum in novemberin areas which were serb ethnic 96.4 % voted for an independent state within the then yugoslav federation .
",
10062,0,," where groups of people do not identify with the state they are less likely to be willing to invest in more generous state services since they do feel that peoples with whom they have no affinity will benefit from them .
",
10063,0,," conversely , where people feel like the state is mostly composed of people like them , they are more willing to invest in education , healthcare and a welfare state .
",
10064,0,," these things will ultimately significantly improve the lives of the people in each new state and lead to stronger states than the one that exists now .
",
10065,0,," for example the scandinavian states , norway , denmark , sweden and finland with their largely homogenous societies are also associated with very high levels of social happiness and generous welfare provision .
",
10066,1,,"the internet and social networks have come to be the core weapon in the arsenal of dissidents when they engage in uprising against oppressive or illiberal regimes.
",
10067,1,," by use of social networks and other social media like twitter, these activists have been able to coordinate broad action and to communicate their message and the spirit of dissent through populations.
",
10068,1,," this was the case during the arab spring, where social media were vital in the overthrow of regimes in egypt and tunisia, with activists and protesters using these tools to spread information and organize.
",
10069,0,," by enacting this subsidy , the west makes a tacit public statement in favour of those involved in uprisings without coming out and publicly taking a side .
",
10070,0,," this is a shrewd position to take as it blunts many of the fall-backs opposed regimes rely upon , such as blaming western provocateurs for instigating the uprising .
",
10071,0,," rather than making a judgment call involving force or sanction , the simple provision of anonymity means the people involved in the uprisings can do it themselves while knowing they have some protections to fall back on that the west alone could provide .
",
10072,0,," this is a purely enabling policy , giving activists on the group access to the freedom of information and expression , which aids not only in their aim to free themselves from tyranny , but also abets the west 's efforts to portray itself publicly as a proponent of justice for all , not just those it happens to favour as a geopolitical ally .
",
10073,0,," in essence , the policy is a public statement of support for the ideas behind uprisings absent the specific taking of sides in a particular conflict .
",
10074,0,," it throws some advantages to those seeking to rise up without undermining their cause through overbearing western intervention .
",
10075,0,," and that statement is a valuable one for western states to make , because democracies tend to be more stable , more able to grow economically and socially in the long term , and are more amenable to trade and discourse with the west .
",
10076,0,," by enacting this policy the west can succeed in this geopolitical aim without making the risers seem to be western pawns .
",
10077,1,,"both the usa and the european union have bans on arms sales to china.
",
10078,1,," these were put in place in 1989, as part of the international reaction to the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square.
",
10079,1,," in the sixteen years since the ban was imposed, china has experienced rapid growth and has become a very important part of the global economy, both importing and exporting goods worth many billions of dollars a year.
",
10080,1,," it has also opened up to foreign investment and, as a recent member of the world trade organisation, is committed to further opening.
",
10081,1,," over the same period, china has also become more active diplomatically, participating more in global and regional bodies such as the united nations.
",
10082,1,," the chinese leadership has called this increasing engagement china's ""peaceful rise"", although other nations worry about continuing territorial claims affecting relations with most of china's neighbours, as well as pressures from growing popular nationalism.
",
10083,1,," the united states in particular is concerned about china's claim on taiwan, which is regarded as a break-away province by the mainland, but which enjoys an unspoken promise of american support in case of an unprovoked chinese invasion.
",
10084,1,," in recent years china has spent a great deal on modernising its armed forces, buying advanced military equipment from russia in particular, and much of this build-up appears to be designed to enable china to project its power outside its own borders.
",
10085,1,,"as china has become more important on the world stage, and a very important trading partner for europe, it has lobbied hard for the eu arms ban to be lifted (australia's similar ban was lifted in 1992, but there is no prospect of the united states doing so).
",
10086,1,," france in particular has argued within the eu for removing the ban, pointing out that acode of conduct on weapons sales would ensure that european military technology did not flood into china.
",
10087,1,," this position appeared to have widespread support from member states, including germany, italy and (at times) the u.k, although the european parliament and public opinion in most member states remained strongly against change.
",
10088,1,," it looked likely the ban would be repealed in mid-2005 but plans were put aside after strong american pressure and concern about china's attitude to taiwan.
",
10089,0,," nonetheless, the issue appears likely to return and will remain controversial.
",
10090,0,,"europe has a developing strategic partnership with china .
",
10091,0,," china is europe 's largest trading partner with eu exports in goods of $ 113.1 billiion and imports of $ 281.9 billion and in services of $ 20.2 billion and $ 16.3 billion respectively , and as china 's rapid growth continues it is playing an increasingly important part in the global economy and in international affairs .
",
10092,0,," clearly it is in the eu 's interests to work together with this emerging superpower .
",
10093,0,," ma zhaoxu a foreign ministry spokesman called it ` the obstacle to the sound growth of the china-eu relationship , ' after more than fifteen years , it is time to lift it .
",
10094,0,," china has repeatedly said that it will never enjoy a normal trading relationship with the eu until the ban is lifted .
",
10095,0,," europe 's first responsibility is to its own citizens economic wellbeing which would benefit from greater trade ties between china and the european union .
",
10096,0,," china has changed over the past two decades , becoming more open to the world and more open domestically .
",
10097,0,," for example it is experimenting with democratic elections at village level and sincebegun extending these to townships .
",
10098,0,," it has also effectively scrapped the repressive one-child policy .
",
10099,0,," internationally china is a responsible member of the international community , as befits a permanent member of the un security council .
",
10100,0,," at the united nations , although it occasionally abstains from votes , it very rarely threatens to use its veto power in the security council , it has only used the veto six times sincewhen the prc joined the un - unlike the usa , for example .
",
10101,0,," its `` peaceful rise '' can also be seen in its hosting of the six-nation talks over north korea 's nuclear programme .
",
10102,0,," and china is increasingly willing to operate within regional diplomatic frameworks covering east asia , se asia and central asia .
",
10103,0,," in a global marketplace , if eu states do n't sell china arms , others will .
",
10104,0,," russia and israel already sell china much high-tech military material , betweenandrussia sold over $ 16billion of arms to china .
",
10105,0,," as israel is a key american ally , us criticism of europe over lifting this ban is particularly unfair .
",
10106,0,," it is in europe 's economic interest to gain part of the huge chinese market and so safeguard european jobs .
",
10107,0,," and if european arms industries can not find export markets , their production for domestic military forces is simply not enough to support the cost of research and development , so our indigenous arms sector may collapse .
",
10108,0,," cooperating with china is the best way to gain influence with the regime in order to promote democracy and human rights , engage it internationally , etc, the chinese respond very badly to being publicly lectured or threatened , but they will listen to those friendly nations who have earned their trust in ways like these .
",
10109,0,," china for example often follows russia , since the beginning of the 1990s its biggest arms supplier , when it comes to voting in the united nations security council .
",
10110,0,," thus both vetoed sanctions against syria inand shortly after russia shifted its position to urging assad to carry out reforms china followed .
",
10111,0,," the influence of the united states over other east asian states in encouraging their democratization also shows that friends can apply influence on issues such as human rights as well as where interests coincide ; the united states played a key role in sheparding philippine dictator marcos out of office and then encouraged korean president chun doo hwan to stick to a single term of office and not to use force against the opposition in.
",
10112,0,," lifting the ban is an investment in the future of the europe-china relationship , and could be of benefit to the whole world , not just the eu .
",
10113,0,," the current arms ban is purely symbolic .
",
10114,0,," china is already able to buy a range of military items from europe , $million worth in, and the usa , which has a similar `` ban '' on weapons sales to china .
",
10115,0,," this is because the eu 's current ban is not legally binding and it is up to each eu member to define and implement the embargo meaning the embargo is not effective .
",
10116,0,," an arms ban is therefore a blunt instrument that does not work .
",
10117,0,," instead future sales should be regulated by a tough eu code of conduct which prevents military equipment being sold to any state which might use it for external aggression or internal repression .
",
10118,0,," such a code of conduct for all arms exports has already existed since.
",
10119,0,," such a code of conduct will be a much better guarantee that china is not sold arms unless eu states are sure they will not be misused .
",
10120,1,,"the european coal and steel community, the organisation that eventually became the european union, was primarily created in order to help keep the peace in europe following world war ii by sharing the vital war making materials of coal and steel.
",
10121,1,," similarly one of the reasons for the creation of the euro was to help maintain peace.
",
10122,1,," former chancellor of germany helmut kohl argued that joining a political union improves the prospects for peace by “containing a potentially dangerous germany within europe.”
",
10123,1,," it is certainly true that the european union has played a role in maintaining peace in europe, although many would argue that nato has made as important, if not more so, a contribution to this.
",
10124,1,," last year the european union won the nobel peace prize for its role.
",
10125,1,," the prize committee justified its decision on the basis that “the union and its forerunners have for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in europe.”
",
10126,1,,"it gave three interlocking reasons:1, today war between germany and france is unthinkable.
",
10127,1,," this shows how, through well-aimed efforts and by building up mutual confidence, historical enemies can become close partners.2, the division between east and west has to a large extent been brought to an end; democracy has been strengthened; many ethnically-based national conflicts have been settled.3, the possibility of eu membership… advanced democracy and human rightsbut today the integration of the european union through the single currency, the euro, can be seen as being as much a threat to peace as it is a creator of it.
",
10128,1,,"this in part depends on what we consider to mean by peace, even now there are very few who would argue that the euro will lead to another war in europe (though there are a few such as dominic sandbrook who think it possible or likely), but a threat to peace does not just have to mean traditional inter-state conflict, with europe's ever declining defence budgets and pacifistic people this option seems vanishingly small.
",
10129,1,," instead the conflict for the moment is economic and political.
",
10130,1,," for the purposes of this debate then we will consider large scale internal conflict to be conflict rather than just interstate war.
",
10131,0,," the euro takes away the national sovereign right to have one 's own currency .
",
10132,0,," as the currency has an immense impact on the economic sovereignty , the state 's ability to influence its own economy , of a nation it is curtailing the sovereignty of that state and its parliament .
",
10133,0,," in particular it prevents any depreciation to regain competitiveness so forcing countries to opt for austerity as the only way to make themselves competitive .
",
10134,0,," they are finding that economic decisions are no longer taken in their own capitals but now the decision making is forced on them from berlin .
",
10135,0,," the people have regularly demonstrated that they do not want more integration in europe yet this is exactly what the euro provides .
",
10136,0,," just take for example the no votes against the lisbon treaty in france and the netherlands , countries traditionally near the core of the european project showing the dislike for further integration .
",
10137,0,," most countries did not have referendums on joining the euro , a decision that they are now finding has immense consequences on individual 's lives .
",
10138,0,," this is then leading to extremism in many countries where the populace feels they no longer have control over their economic future .
",
10139,0,," even germany now has an anti-euro party , alternative für deutschland , and support for eurosceptic parties throughout europe has been rising ever since the start of the crisis in the eurozone .
",
10140,0,," most of these will be peaceful but there are already parties like golden dawn in greece that use violence and intimidation in politics .
",
10141,0,," the euro crisis has forced the eurozone members into making policy on the fly without the support of the electorate .
",
10142,0,," for example national politicians , who are of course democratically elected , have been making a series of promises against bailouts that they have then broken ; a promise by german chancellor angela merkel that `` an extension of the current bailout funds will not happen on germany 's watch , '' lasted all of two months .
",
10143,0,," the voters of the countries that are providing the bailouts have not voted for the packages that are using their money and they were certainly not in the manifestos of the governing parties .
",
10144,0,," parliaments have voted on the measures but have often been given little choice and little time to debate complicated measures .
",
10145,0,," on the other hand in those who are being bailed out the conditions that are being attached are unpopular , in particular the demand for austerity has caused riots .
",
10146,0,," the parliaments of the recipient states have generally voted in favour so opposition has come from the streets .
",
10147,0,," cyprus is the first country to reject a bailout as a result of its attendant conditions ; although when faced with no other option the politicians buckled it could be simply the first country to try to escape the straight jacket .
",
10148,0,," when the option is take conditions the public wo n't accept , such as savers having their money taken as in the cyprus bail out , or exit from the euro then the relationships within the euro are going to be increasingly conflictual .
",
10149,0,," in the 1990s the european union introduced the principle of subsidiarity in order to try to placate fears about too much power moving to ` brussels ' from national parliaments .
",
10150,0,," subsidiarity means that power will reside at the appropriate level that is closest to the citizens , be that regional , national , or european .
",
10151,0,," it is questionable whether this principle has stopped the european level from accumulating power , even the tenth amendment in the us that reserves power to the states when not explicitly given the federal level has not stopped the moment of power to washington .
",
10152,0,," subsidiarity has however boosted the power of the regions and provided a cover for separatism .
",
10153,0,," the existence of the euro provides a kind of safety net for nations that desire independence from the current unions they are in , particularly catalonia and scotland .
",
10154,0,," the leaders of pro-independence parties can claim that they will be no worse off for leaving their current union as they will still be a part of the euro and the european union .
",
10155,0,," artur mas , catalonia 's president , has even suggested that its referendum question would be `` do you want catalonia to become a new state within the european union ? ''
",
10156,0,," there have been hints regional independence movements could lead to violence pujol the general secretary of the governing catalan party says `` there will be no way to avoid it .
",
10157,0,," if we do n't deliver it someone else will .
",
10158,0,," more radical parties .
",
10159,0,," but in a negotiation ... it 's not the best thing to reveal what you are going to do next '' .
",
10160,0,," the result then may be a more violent campaign as happened in the basque country .
",
10161,0,," many have argued that the euro inevitably leads to a transfer union , where there are large transfers of money between the members , far larger than the tiny eu budget , but so far the germans have been implacably opposed .
",
10162,0,," there has been opposition to bailouts precisely because it is seen as the start of a union transferring money from the core countries , such as germany , to the poorer periphery .
",
10163,0,," inability to help those areas that are less competitive is the main problem of a currency union without accompanying fiscal union .
",
10164,0,," the euro has therefore built in the competitive advantage of germany ; it exports huge amounts to the euro 's periphery because these countries can not devalue their currency to make their products competitive .
",
10165,0,," it is therefore inevitable that these countries will go into debt paying for these goods .
",
10166,0,," the is then a cycle of conflict between competitive countries and those who are not competitive in which as we have seen those who are uncompetitive are seen as lazy while the competitive as bullying .
",
10167,0,," this tension will eventually either lead to a split or conflict .
",
10168,1,,"millennium development goaltargeted inequalities in primary education - setting an agenda of equality in opportunities to achieve universal primary education, for girls and boys, by 2015.
",
10169,1,," in response to the development hype enrolment rates have increased across the developing world and disparities in literacy rates narrowed.
",
10170,1,," the target is expected to be met in northern africa, by 2015, however, in sub-saharan africa while there have been moderate gains progress has stalled making it questionable whether the target will be made a reality.
",
10171,1,," over half of the children not in school are in sub-saharan africa (un, 2013).
",
10172,1,,"achieving universal primary education has centred on tackling issues on enrolment - particularly gender based inequalities to recognise the equal right to education, completion of primary school, and improving literacy rates.
",
10173,1,," this therefore turns to a focus on teachers - a vital resource in achieving and fundamentally sustaining, the goal.
",
10174,1,," rising protests by teachers, in tanzania (2012), zimbabwe (2014), and south africa (2013), indicates the sense of dissatisfaction amongst current teachers.
",
10175,1,," further, low student-teacher ratios identify the growing reality of overcrowded schools.
",
10176,1,," can efforts be placed on encouraging enrolment if the teachers who provide teaching are inadequate, unmotivated, and underfunded?
",
10177,1,,"the scale of the teaching problem requires recognition.
",
10178,1,," the focus is on teachers across the education sector - from primary to universities.
",
10179,1,," this returns to discussion on how the right to education can be achieved; and what models of investment need to be encouraged.
",
10180,1,," currently funds are diverted to building infrastructure and rapid training for teachers, failing to integrate social policy schemes for teachers and ensuring the quality of education for students.
",
10181,0,," unesco  report the need for 6.8 mn teachers byfor the right to primary education to be achieved .
",
10182,0,," the teaching workforce requires includes both replacements and additional teachers .
",
10183,0,," africa has a reality of low teacher-student ratios .
",
10184,0,," in,students were reported per teacher in the central african republic , world bank  .
",
10185,0,," positive schemes are needed to incentivise potential teachers to enter the profession and meet demand .
",
10186,0,," careers can be encouraged through multiple paths .
",
10187,0,," for example , providing incentives to study teaching as a profession .
",
10188,0,," tanzania 's ministry of education provides grants to students entering university to study teaching .
",
10189,0,," investment is required in teacher training to ensure quality control .
",
10190,0,," teachers need to be provided with qualifications and effective training both technical and theoretical .
",
10191,0,," teachers need to be introduced to methods on how to interact with students , provoke student debates , and manage large classes .
",
10192,0,," in-service training and pre-teaching training are key .
",
10193,0,," countries such as uganda and angola have utilised on the job training for teachers , with positive results for teaching quality .
",
10194,0,," in uganda initiatives , such as insstep , provided capacity training to teachers and headteachers .
",
10195,0,," 14,000 secondary school teachers participated between 1994-1999 , followed by school inspections to monitor capacity .
",
10196,0,," the ` mobile-caravan ' approach is making it easier , more feasible , and flexible , to provide training .
",
10197,0,," additionally , investors and national governments need to provide model schools , indicating what responsibilities teachers have and enabling knowledge transfer .
",
10198,0,," model schools can assist in alleviating work pressures for teachers by showing their terms of contract , duties and obligations .
",
10199,0,," increasingly teachers are expected to fulfil the role of carer , counsellor , and advisers on hiv/aids without relevant training .
",
10200,0,," although the extent of rural-urban disparities remains debatable , geographical disparities in living standards and education are articulated across africa .
",
10201,0,," the location , and provision , of teachers does not always match need .
",
10202,0,," in uganda , the universalisation of education has been met with inequities , regionally and across socioeconomic groups , in the quality of education , hedger et al  .
",
10203,0,," incentives are required to deploy teachers to districts according to need ; and encourage teachers to relocate .
",
10204,0,," for example , awards need to be provided for teachers to move to rural areas , and the development of teacher housing schemes - providing teachers with houses in new locations .
",
10205,0,," the creation of national social policies which provide secure , and stable , wages for teachers is fundamental .
",
10206,0,," social policy can make satisfied teachers .
",
10207,0,," a key concern amongst teachers is finance - inadequate wages and insurance .
",
10208,0,," teacher wages is considerably lower than other formal professions - combining to enforce low morale and occupational motivation as pay is too low to sustain individuals and households , bennell  .
",
10209,0,," in south africa an average teaching salary is 19,535 zar in contrast to the 28,235 zar average granted in all jobs in south africa , salary explorer  .
",
10210,0,," further , social policy is required to introduce teacher pension schemes .
",
10211,0,," pension schemes are provided for workers within the formal employment sector , by various public organisations - including the government and gepf .
",
10212,0,," however , some national pension schemes are more developed than others and teachers need to be ensured the profession can provide investments for future security .
",
10213,0,," an ageing population only reinforces its importance .
",
10214,1,,"mobility remains a key factor for development - a means of enabling the development of economic markets at a local, national, and regional scale (wdr, 2009).
",
10215,1,," the world bank classifies africa as a continent that remains largely ‘immobile’.
",
10216,1,," borders are identified as a key restriction in africa.
",
10217,1,," an interactive tool by the guardian shows how africa remains the least connected continent in terms of air travel (the guardian, 2014).
",
10218,1,," further, when considering the global geography of airlines - a key part of globalisation - african cities and nations remain embedded in the past with expensive, lengthy, and infrequent, air transport.
",
10219,1,," however new opportunities are arising and the number of airlines operating within africa has risen.
",
10220,1,,"open skies is a policy tool used to liberalise air travel.
",
10221,1,," the eu-us transatlantic agreement can be used as an example.
",
10222,1,," the eu-us open sky agreements treaty has two components.
",
10223,1,," the first – in 2007, liberalised air travel on both sides, enabling any us and european airline to have open access to any airports within the eu and us.
",
10224,1,," british airways and virgin atlantic no longer hold the monopoly on who can fly between london and new york.
",
10225,1,," the objectives of the first component of the treaty included changes for consumers and suppliers in the aviation industry: promoting freedom for aviation investors, enabling greater transatlantic integration, and a healthier aviation industry.
",
10226,1,," additionally the treaty was predicted to generate more airline passengers, jobs, and a rise in tourist numbers.
",
10227,1,," the second component of the treaty – signed in 2010, set to remove restrictions and regulations on the foreign ownership of airlines.
",
10228,1,,"the open sky agreement has been justified as being beneficial to passengers and airline companies, creating competitive prices, frequent travel options, and a reinvigorated market.
",
10229,1,," agreements are presented as a win-win situation.
",
10230,1,," in africa the closest policy to open skies is the yamoussoukro decision (1999), calling for fewer restrictions on cross-border travel and the liberalisation of intra-african air transport rather than protection of national carriers.
",
10231,1,," the commitment was signed byafrican nations, however implementation results are lagging.
",
10232,1,,"however, the benefits identified remain largely political and economic.
",
10233,1,," to what extent is a social and environmental perspective required to enable a more realistic picture?
",
10234,1,," as suggestions are being made to implement and construct an open sky agreement across the african continent – to create a competitive aviation industry and improve integration – who will benefit and how sustainable are the proposals?
",
10235,0,," this explores arguments for and against an open sky agreement both within the african continent and globally.
",
10236,0,,"the introduction of a pan-african open sky agreement will ensure competition .
",
10237,0,," a competitive airline industry will have a cumulative effect on prices and safety standards .
",
10238,0,," first , prices will be reduced as the market is no longer monopolised by a few airlines .
",
10239,0,," currently national governments are able to place strict regulations , high fuel and passenger taxes on airlines .
",
10240,0,," liberalising the industry would mean that airlines are increasingly controlled by the hand of the market , not the state .
",
10241,0,," competitive airline prices will ensure air travel is no longer exclusively an elite luxury .
",
10242,0,," secondly , introducing new competition will force airlines to implement higher standards - of service and safety .
",
10243,0,," power is redistributed to the consumer and traveller , who are able to pick and choose the best service .
",
10244,0,," therefore the companies need to be on the top of their game .
",
10245,0,," evidence in europe has shown the competitiveness of liberalisation , resulting in the rise of cheap air travel .
",
10246,0,," such low-cost carriers now account for a third of intra-eu travel , ecmt  .
",
10247,0,," the aviation industry is vital for economic growth for bringing africa into the positive side of globalisation .
",
10248,0,," the state-owned ethiopian airlines enterprise is one example of a success story for an african airline .
",
10249,0,," ethiopian airlines has the greatest amount of traffic as a result of air traffic liberalisation .
",
10250,0,," the returns gained from ethiopian airlines have been central to promoting ethiopia 's national growth strategy .
",
10251,0,," governments can only gain from liberalisation in multiple sectors , including airlines .
",
10252,0,," liberalisation , and deregulation , of airlines acts creates cumulative causation , where one event causes multiple changes , for tourism , production networks , jobs , and infrastructure development .
",
10253,0,," in ethiopia , air networks are building industries and the pushing regions economic development .
",
10254,0,," in kenya 's case , deregulation of airlines may improve the speed and availability of key global commodities , such as tourism , and flowers - booming industries that require rapid transport .
",
10255,0,," in africa% of tourism-related jobs are supported directly by the aviation industry , world bank  .
",
10256,0,," introducing a treaty whereby flights are liberalised across africa , and foreign airlines incorporated , will provide benefits for africa .
",
10257,0,," for example , foreign companies will be able to tackle gaps in the market .
",
10258,0,," currently there is a lack of direct flights between key destinations .
",
10259,0,," direct flights mean direct interconnections to desired ; and new , places .
",
10260,0,," for example , with new business opportunities emerging in nigeria a direct flight connecting cape town and lagos requires investment .
",
10261,0,," air traffic in the eu is a positive example .
",
10262,0,," as a result of deregulation budget airlines have expanded throughout the continent eu air traffic and new flight routes introduced .
",
10263,0,," there has been a% increase of intra-eu routes and% increase in the number of routes provided by at least two companies , ecmt  .
",
10264,1,,"africa’s large animals are well documented in history.
",
10265,1,," elephants were a source of great fear in the ancient african armies and they became a source of fascination for europeans.
",
10266,1,," when they began to explore and colonise the continent, the hides, horns, tusks and pelts of africa’s wildlife became valuable trophies.
",
10267,1,,"unfortunately, hunting and destruction of their environments has led to the extinction of many species, such as the quagga and the western black rhinoceros, and has left others critically endangered.
",
10268,1,," there are overcritically endangered species in africa, including african elephants, lions and rhinoceroses.
",
10269,1,," to ensure the survival of these animals, nature reserves were established as early as 1898.
",
10270,1,," with a focus on conservation, it became illegal to hunt or destroy the environment of the endangered species which lived on the reserve.
",
10271,1,," hunting of these animals was officially recognised as ‘poaching’, making it a punishable activity.
",
10272,1,," since the beginning of the 21st century however, the numbers of these animals has nosedived.
",
10273,1,," tanzania’s elephant population has decreased from 109,419 elephants into 13,084 in 2014.
",
10274,1,," this has led to increased calls for a tougher approach towards the protection of endangered animals.
",
10275,1,," this mainly suggests a militarised response, but can also include higher levels of passive protection (fencing areas off) and increased punishment in the justice system.
",
10276,1,,"  whether or not a tougher approach will work has become an issue of contention, illustrated by the responses to tanzanian minister khamis kagaski’s call to execute poachers “on the spot”.
",
10277,0,," a tougher approach to the protection of animals is needed to prevent their natural habitats from being destroyed by locals .
",
10278,0,," as humans expand their agricultural activity in africa they are destroying the environments of endangered animals and pushing others towards being endangered .
",
10279,0,," due to an increase in large scale cotton plantations and food crops , the west african lion has seen a marked decrease in population ; numbering less thanin early.
",
10280,0,," tougher protection , such as fencing off areas from human activity , has been suggested and has seen success in south africa .
",
10281,0,," a stronger , militarised approach is needed as poaching is becoming far more advanced .
",
10282,0,," poachers now operate with high-calibre rifles , night vision scopes , silencers and use helicopters to hunt their prey .
",
10283,0,," these methods are used particularly against rhinoceroses in south africa , whose horns have become extremely valuable on the asian market for their supposed medical properties .
",
10284,0,," in response to this , south african rangers are being given specialised training and use their own aerial surveillance to track poachers down with success , supporting the argument for a militarised response to protect endangered animals .
",
10285,0,," endangered animals warrant a tougher degree of protection in africa as they have notable cultural significance .
",
10286,0,," some groups believe that african elephants have mystic powers attached to them and have coveted them for centuries .
",
10287,0,," african lions have been depicted on the coat of arms for states and institutions both past and present .
",
10288,0,," they are intrinsically linked with africa 's past and its identity .
",
10289,0,," the extinction of these animals , therefore , would have a negative cultural impact and should be prevented .
",
10290,0,," stronger protection of animals should be implemented to reduce the funding for terrorist groups .
",
10291,0,," certain terrorist organisations use the illegal ivory and horn trade as funding for their operations .
",
10292,0,," al-shabaab , the lord 's resistance army , lra , and the sudanese janjaweed all use the illicit trade as a source of income , with the former using the trade for% of its expenditure .
",
10293,0,," this enables them to carry out attacks such as thewestgate siege in kenya .
",
10294,0,," tougher protection of endangered animals would reduce the ability of these groups to fund themselves .
",
10295,0,," in turn , this would decrease their operational capability , increasing stability in africa .
",
10296,0,," a major failing in current anti-poaching operations is that the poachers are rarely prosecuted .
",
10297,0,," african legal systems rarely prioritise poaching as a serious crime , with offenders usually receiving trivial fines1 .
",
10298,0,," one of the major reasons for the western black rhinoceros ' extinction inwas the complete lack of sentencing for any of the poachers who were captured .
",
10299,0,," the system also fails to prosecute the brains behind many of the operations due to poor investigative methods .
",
10300,0,," this creates an impression in the minds of the poachers that they can operate with impunity .
",
10301,1,,"on the 30th may 2011, the ethiopian government announced plans for the construction of the ‘grand ethiopian renaissance dam’ (gerd).
",
10302,1,," set to be africa’s largest gravity dam atm tall and 1,800 m wide, it will span the width of one of two major tributaries that create the nile; the blue nile.
",
10303,1,," the gerd is expected to be completed by julyand will produce 6,000 mw of electricity.
",
10304,1,,"  the dam is expected to be able to generate energy for all of ethiopia, however egypt’s and sudan’s positions downstream from the gerd have made them question the impact of the dam on their respective countries.
",
10305,1,,"over the next two years tensions continued to mount.
",
10306,1,," the majority of egypt’s water comes from outside its borders, the nile is 96% of egypt’s renewable water, which has led egypt to fervently defend its water rights.
",
10307,1,," instability within egypt, caused by the arab spring and the toppling of president hosni mubarak, meant that the issue was not addressed until mohamed morsi was elected as president.
",
10308,1,,"  during the year that morsi spent in office, and the months afterwards where an interim government took charge, there have been rising political tensions between the two states disputing whether ethiopia really does have the right to build the gerd.
",
10309,0,," when the dam is in full effect , it should be able to provide the entirety of ethiopia 's population with electricity .
",
10310,0,," the united nations foundation placed access to energy as a high priority for developing countries , it enables access to key services and enables more income-generating activities .
",
10311,0,," if ethiopia discontinued the project , then they would deprive their citizens of economic and health security .
",
10312,0,," using energy from a dam will have its own benefits .
",
10313,0,," the energy will be renewable source and will provide energy security for this developing state , thus justifying the project .
",
10314,0,," the dam will produce significant economic potential for ethiopia .
",
10315,0,," in, ethiopia had to import 125,000 metric tonnes of coal to fuel its power stations .
",
10316,0,," over% of the country 's imports are orientated towards meeting its fuel demands .
",
10317,0,," if ethiopia can replace these imports with its own energy then it can make significant savings .
",
10318,0,," the diverted money could be contributed towards development , which would be assisted by greater accessibility to electricity .
",
10319,0,," in addition to this , 12,000 jobs will be created and ethiopia will become an energy exporter .
",
10320,0,," the excess energy from powering africa will be enough to supply the surrounding region , making energy a viable export market for ethiopia to tap in to .
",
10321,0,," in combination with the greater access electricity dependent to income-generating activities , these factors give ethiopia hope of a positive economic future .
",
10322,0,," gerd will have environmentally positive consequences for the region .
",
10323,0,," the major environmental benefit is the clean and renewable energy source .
",
10324,0,," there is an unlimited supply of electricity and the production of this energy does not contribute to global carbon dioxide emissions .
",
10325,0,," another environmental benefit is that the dam will reduce the chances of flooding downstream and drought , enabling the country to better combat climate change which is worsening these factors .
",
10326,0,," flood protection will prevent settled areas from being destroyed through rising river levels , benefitting sudan and egypt as well as ethiopia .
",
10327,1,,"the democratic republic of the congo (drc) is one of the poorest and most war torn countries in the world.
",
10328,1,," yet it is also a country with immense natural wealth, not least of which is the great congo river itself.
",
10329,1,," the congo river is a river of superlatives, one of the biggest in the world it is 4700km long with a drainage basin of 4million km2 and a discharge of 41,000 m3/sec.
",
10330,1,," the congo river is also unique in having rapids in its lower course.
",
10331,1,," these rapids for centuries made the interior of the region impenetrable to outsiders now they provide an opportunity for hydroelectric power which relies upon being able to use water and gravity to drive turbines and create electricity.
",
10332,1,," the congo at inga dropsmeters over 14.5km of waterfalls and rapids.
",
10333,1,,"there are already two dams at the inga falls and a third on the way.
",
10334,1,," inga i and ii were constructed during the rule of dictator mobutu along with the inga-shaba high voltage power lines completed in 1982.
",
10335,1,," these grand projects brought zaire (as it was then called) deeply into debt despite the power being meant to allow investment in natural resources.
",
10336,1,," inga iii is currently under construction and will produce 4,800 mw of electricity without much disruption to the river as the river won’t be closed off and no tunnels built.
",
10337,1,," inga iii might be said to be stage i of the grand inga dam even though it will be able to operate independently.
",
10338,1,,"the biggest project is the proposed $50 billion grand inga dam which would generate up to 40,000mw.
",
10339,1,," it is a ‘run-of-river’ project in which water is siphoned off the main flow of the river before going through turbines to get back into the main channel.
",
10340,1,," in the case of the grand inga this means flooding side valleys at a bend in the river.
",
10341,1,," the advantage is that the main course of the river is left unaltered.
",
10342,1,," despite this it is clearly an immense project that will provoke opposition from environmental activists and questions about the drc’s ability to manage such a project.
",
10343,0,," only% of sub saharan africa 's population has access to electricity .
",
10344,0,," this has immense consequences not just for the economy as production and investment is constrained but also on society .
",
10345,0,," the world bank says lack of electricity affects human rights `` people can not access modern hospital services without electricity , or feel relief from sweltering heat .
",
10346,0,," food can not be refrigerated and businesses can not function .
",
10347,0,," children can not go to school ... the list of deprivation goes on . ''
",
10348,0,," conveniently it is suggested that the `` grand inga will thus provide more than half of the continent with renewable energy at a low price , '' providing electricity to half a billion people so eliminating much of this electricity gap .
",
10349,0,," the grand inga dam would be an immense boost to the drc 's economy .
",
10350,0,," it would mean a huge amount of investment coming into the country as almost all the $billion construction cost would be coming from outside the country which would mean thousands of workers employed and spending money in the drc as well as boosting local suppliers .
",
10351,0,," once the project is complete the dam will provide cheap electricity so making industry more competitive and providing electricity to homes .
",
10352,0,," even the initial stages through inga iii are expected to provide electricity for 25,000 households in kinshasa .
",
10353,0,," dr congo has been one of the most war ravaged countries in the world over the last two decades .
",
10354,0,," the grand inga provides a project that can potentially benefit everyone in the country by providing cheap electricity and an economic boost .
",
10355,0,," it will also provide large export earnings ; to take an comparatively local example ethiopia earns $ 1.5 million per month exporting 60mw to djibouti atcents per kwh comparable to prices in south africa so if congo were to be exportingtimes that , at 30,000 mw only 3/4ths of the capacity , it would be earning $ 9billion per year .
",
10356,0,," this then will provide more money to invest and to ameliorate problems .
",
10357,0,," the project can therefore be a project for the nation to rally around helping create and keep stability after the surrender of the rebel group m23 in october.
",
10358,0,," while the congo is mostly navigable it is only usable internally .
",
10359,0,," the rapids cut the middle congo off from the sea .
",
10360,0,," the building of the dams could be combined with canalisation and locks to enable international goods to be easily transported to and from the interior .
",
10361,0,," this would help integrate central africa economically into the global economy making the region much more attractive for investment .
",
10362,1,,"the past two decades have seen rapid and overwhelming progress in rwanda, a country that was hit by the worst post cold war atrocity inwhen up to a million people perished in genocide.
",
10363,1,," therwanda genocide against the tutsi destroyed the country leaving no standing government institution, and no infrastructure and public services.
",
10364,1,," it also left a large number of widows and orphans and a population traumatised by what it had witnessed and in many cases engaged in.
",
10365,1,," there seemed no hope of a future.
",
10366,1,," it was therefore the responsibility of the new government to revive this perishing state.
",
10367,1,," surprisingly within onlyyears, rwanda has been hailed for its outstanding economic progress, the implementation of millennium development goals, improvement of infrastructure, health care, education, zero tolerance to corruption, gender empowerment and security.
",
10368,1,," foreign aid to support the country’s budget has also been reduced from 100% into 40% in[1].
",
10369,1,,"however the past five years has seen growing criticism against the rwandan leadership internationally.
",
10370,1,," activists and journalists are condemning the government for its laws that limit freedom of press and expression in the country.
",
10371,1,," the media is not very diverse and is concentrated in the capital kigali.
",
10372,1,," some outlets are privately-owned but government-controlled ones (radio rwanda and the national tv station tvr) dominate.
",
10373,1,," some independent newspapers have been pressured into closing down by the government.
",
10374,1,," relations between the government and foreign media are also very difficult [2] and rwanda has dropped more thanplaces on the world press freedom index to 162nd – where with the possible exception of iran its neighbours in the list are all dictatorships [3].
",
10375,1,," additionally, amnesty international has stated that it is unsafe to speak out in rwanda due to restrictions on freedom of expression[4].
",
10376,1,," in response, the government down plays these critics by pointing out that the media played a big part in preparing and carrying out genocide.
",
10377,1,," outlets such as radio télévision libre des milles collines (rtlm) and the newspaper kangura encouraged genocide and helped direct militias and so there is need for a certain degree of restriction[5].
",
10378,1,," observers blame kagame’s authoritarian style of leadership for this [4], but it appears that, for the time being at least, many rwandans are also scared of political freedom and freedom of expression for the instability they might trigger.
",
10379,0,," can this hinder economic development and progress?
",
10380,0,,"president kagame though considered a visionary leader has made rwanda a country based on one man 's ideas .
",
10381,0,," he has silenced critics , opposition and any counter arguments that may not support his opinions through tough rules imposed against the media and free speech .
",
10382,0,," this sparked misunderstandings within the government forcingfour high rank officials in exile , one , an ex-intelligence chief was recently murdered in south africa  .
",
10383,0,," rwanda is essentially a hard-line , one-party , secretive police state with a façade of democracy  .
",
10384,0,," to avoid future conflict and government break down kagame needs to convene a genuine , inclusive , unconditional and comprehensive national dialogue with the aim of preparing and strengthening the country 's future progress .
",
10385,0,," the fact that most rwandans still want him to run for re-election after his two terms inshows how much he has controlled people to believe he is the only potential leader in a country of more thanmillion citizens .
",
10386,0,," if rwanda is to have a stable future democracy it needs to be recognised that the opposition are patriots too and should be entitled to freedom of speech and press to give them an opportunity to share their views on how the country can be improved .
",
10387,0,," for democracy in rwanda to progress the country needs to accept the idea of freedom of speech and a ` loyal opposition ' .
",
10388,0,,"  one of the major factors that exacerbated genocide ideology was the `` akazu '' controlled media which made most of the hutu population wrongfully obey authority and government propaganda of divisionism  .
",
10389,0,," this was achieved by proclaiming that the tutsi are snakes and cockroaches in newspapers , and directing the hutu extremists to where killings were to be conducted on radio rtlm .
",
10390,0,," meanwhile they also refused to broadcast speeches calling out for unity among people helping to lead to the assassination of the then prime minister agathe uwilingiyimana who opposed government restrictions .
",
10391,0,," there was no space to question policies and ideas that were encouraging genocide by manipulating people to believe it was right path for rwanda .
",
10392,0,," the genocide should therefore serve as an example that restricting freedoms of speech and press can cause severe damage .
",
10393,0,," this is especially harmful to a healing and reconciling country like rwanda that needs the freedom to debate the past and analyse how far it has come openly .
",
10394,0,," rwanda should learn from the past that freedom of speech is necessary to prevent conflict while having only one side potentially exacerbates it .
",
10395,0,," rwanda , though a progressing country is still aid dependent which has been a backbone for its achievements today  .
",
10396,0,," spoiling rwanda 's relations with the international community would therefor be destabilising rwanda 's focus and growth .
",
10397,0,," this has been evident when some countries cut aid to rwanda recently following allegations of the government supporting insecurity in congo  .
",
10398,0,," most donor governments are strong backers of human rights and freedom .
",
10399,0,," continued restrictions to freedom of speech may provoke international reaction through cutting aid and trade ties a move that may hinder the success of rwanda 's goals .
",
10400,0,," aid has been cut on other human rights issues for example donor countries have recently acted to cut aid to uganda as a result of their criminalisation of homosexuality .
",
10401,1,,"the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw) won the nobel prize for peace on the 11th october“for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons”.
",
10402,1,," the nobel prize committee argued “recent events in syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.”
",
10403,1,," yet this was only just over a week after the opcw started in its efforts to disarm syria’s chemical weapons, a mission that will almost certainly prove to be the organisation’s biggest test.
",
10404,1,," and only a couple of months after the first confirmed chemical weapons attack since the chemical weapons convention came into effect in 1997.
",
10405,1,,"the weapons inspectors are only in syria as a result of a last minute deal between the great powers of russia and the united states as a way to avoid a bombing campaign by the americans and french.
",
10406,1,," the united states attempts to create a coalition to bomb syria were already stumbling when secretary of state john kerry in a news conference in london responded to how war could be averted with ""[assad] could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week ….
",
10407,1,," but he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done.""
",
10408,1,," the russians took this as an opening to suggest putting syria's chemical weapons under international control which the syrian government quickly accepted with foreign minister walid al-moallem saying ""syria welcomes the russian proposal out of concern for the lives of the syrian people, the security of our country and because it believes in the wisdom of the russian leadership that seeks to avert american aggression against our people.
",
10409,1,,"""the result was a framework agreed between russia and the united states on the 14th september whereby syria would agree to the destruction of all chemical agents and related equipment with the monitoring of the opcw.
",
10410,1,," a rough timeline was also decided “a. completion of initial opcw on-site inspections by november.
",
10411,1,," b. destruction of production and mixing/filling equipment by november.
",
10412,1,," c. complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment in the first half of 2014.”
",
10413,1,,"on the same day syria joined the chemical weapons convention, provisionally applying it until its entry into force on the 14th octoberwhich allowed the weapons inspectors to begin their work of first compiling and then destroying syria's stockpile of wmd.
",
10414,1,,"there was an initial deadline for the handover by 6th february.
",
10415,1,," this was however not met resulting in negotiations on a new date and a new deadline of the 13th april, a deadline that may well be missed but probably not by much.
",
10416,1,," however even if the deadlines are met there will remain questions about whether the inspectors have been beneficial as the war has raged around them.
",
10417,1,," and whether assad has really given up all of his weapons of mass destruction.
",
10418,0,," the biggest difficulty with the weapons inspectors being in syria is that they are a sideshow to the real problem .
",
10419,0,," yes chemical weapons use is horrific but their use in syria has caused far fewer casualties than conventional weapons .
",
10420,0,," the syrian observatory for human rights put the total death toll at 115,000 at the end of septemberby comparison the chemical weapons attack that triggered the threat of intervention and therefore the inspections caused somewhere betweenanddeaths .
",
10421,0,," syria 's having joined the chemical weapons convention and allowed in inspectors may prevent more deaths as a result of chemical weapons but it has not stopped the conflict .
",
10422,0,," many thousands more will die as a result of the conflict while the international community looks on patting itself on the back that it has somehow managed to find a solution .
",
10423,0,," chemical weapons are a horrifying weapon of mass destruction but they are by no means the only such horrific weapons .
",
10424,0,," james clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence says `` we judge that some elements of syria 's biological warfare programme might have advanced beyond the research and development stage and might be capable of limited agent production , based on the duration of its longstanding programme '' .
",
10425,0,," biological weapons could potentially be even more devastating than chemical weapons as they do n't necessarily affect just a localised area then disperse .
",
10426,0,," as with other viruses they can be passed from person to person .
",
10427,0,," in a country like syria where the health services have broken down , and basically do n't exist in opposition areas the result could be huge numbers of deaths .
",
10428,0,," it is inconsistent to disarm one type of weapon while leaving another type of wmd available to the syrian regime .
",
10429,0,," weapons inspectors are unlikely to actually be able to totally disarm syria .
",
10430,0,," the opcw has been given a target of dismantling syria 's arsenal by the middle ofbut has admitted that it is a tight deadline that will require temporary ceasefires if the target is to be reached .
",
10431,0,," this is because `` for any particular move that the team has to undertake , the security situation is assessed .
",
10432,0,," unless we get the clearance from our un colleagues , we do n't move . ''
",
10433,0,," clearly if the weapons inspectors wo n't go where there is a high risk to themselves they are unlikely to get the job done .
",
10434,0,," already inspectors have encountered situations where they ca n't gain access to sites due to safety concerns .
",
10435,0,," moreover in a conflict situation it will be extremely difficult to verify that all of syria 's chemical weapons have been dismantled .
",
10436,0,," there are two potential problems -- will the syrian government really be honest about the size of its stockpiles or will it quietly keep some back , and will the inspectors be able to gain access to all areas both government and rebel held ?
",
10437,0,," so long as there is conflict there will clearly be a chaotic situation in which weapons could be buried , or hidden , or simply never found .
",
10438,0,," yria is falling well behind on handing over its weapons .
",
10439,0,," the deadliest chemicals were supposed to be removed by 1st january and the rest by 6th february .
",
10440,0,," neither happened .
",
10441,0,," the syrian government blamed the lack of protective equipment as well as the security situation but the opcw says it has handed over the necessary equipment .
",
10442,0,," under a new timetable syria has pledged to remove all chemical weapons by 13th april , but by the end of march had only removed just over half .
",
10443,0,," if syria continues to fail to meet deadlines there have to be consequences , including abandoning the mission .
",
10444,1,,"zambia’s health profile remains bleak.
",
10445,1,," the country’s health profile showcases a life expectancy of 54/56 years for male/females; a child mortality rate ofper 1,000 births; anddeaths due to hiv/aids per 100,000 of the population (gho, 2013).
",
10446,1,," around 6.1% of the gdp is spent on health; and of greater concern is the loss of doctors and nurses.
",
10447,1,," zambia is identified as having a ‘human resource crisis’, with one of the worst ratios of doctors to population.
",
10448,1,," in zambia, the ratio stands atto 15,000 for doctors andto 1,500 for nurses (makasa, 2008); while the who recommend a ratio of 1:5,000 for doctors, and 1:700 for nurses, in african nation-states.
",
10449,1,," nevertheless the human resource shortage continues to widen through zambia’s ‘brain-drain’, with trained health professionals continuing to immigrate.
",
10450,1,," the lack of trained health professionals, and zambia’s growing population, has raised concern but it has also resulted in innovative methods in order to provide solutions.
",
10451,1,," the virtual doctor project (vdp) being pioneered in zambia is a case in point.
",
10452,1,," with 61% of the population, in 2011, identified as cellular subscribers the project provides a means to ensure access to health care is granted.
",
10453,1,,"the project works on providing vital health care through the internet and mobile broadband.
",
10454,1,," the telemedicine healthcare will connect patients and clinic staff in rural areas to medical doctors and specialists located all over the world.
",
10455,1,," the networks formed provide ‘virtual doctors’ that will assist in providing precise, quick, diagnosis; and treatment for people living in remote areas.
",
10456,1,," zimbabwean medical officers work in a mobile clinic, visiting rural locations.
",
10457,1,," visited patients are screened with appropriate treatment provided.
",
10458,1,," if additional information is required, or the doctors do not know the cause of the problem, patient details can be sent to a network of global medical experts for further advice.
",
10459,1,," the project has three key objectives.
",
10460,1,," first, broadening the scope of patients able to access treatment; secondly, reducing the need to go to distant health centres and unnecessary mortality as a result of late, or inadequate, diagnosis; and finally, improving the efficiency of patient care through knowledge transfers and faster treatment.
",
10461,1,," this focuses on the vdp to explore whether such objectives can be fulfilled.
",
10462,1,," additionally, the project remains of interest due to the technological shift occurring within africa.
",
10463,0,," can technology provide a means to fill zambia’s health care gap?
",
10464,0,,"zambia 's human resource crisis in healthcare is most prominent in rural areas .
",
10465,0,," poverty remains widespread and despite zambia 's high economic fortune as a result of copper during the 1960s it has become a heavily-indebted poor country .
",
10466,0,," the world bank  classifies% of zambia 's poor as residing in rural areas .
",
10467,0,," with disparities in access to health prevalent , zambia needs to train new doctors and nurses to ensure the population can access health care .
",
10468,0,," the vdp is therefore tackling the issue of access within rural , and remote , areas .
",
10469,0,," access to health is a human right , and the vdp is ensuring such rights are become a reality in rural areas and rural populations .
",
10470,0,," mortality and morbidity can be reduced as rural health workers are able to diagnose and treat a wider range of conditions .
",
10471,0,," the use of ict and creating a network of professional experts enables learning and knowledge transfer between health workers and academics .
",
10472,0,," in addition to the brain-drain , whereby skilled health professionals continue to emigrate from zambia , zambia also shows a slow rate of training of new health workers .
",
10473,0,," therefore the vdp provides a vital learning tool .
",
10474,0,," vdp provides practical skills by healthcare workers to learn from first-hand experience while having access to a field of experts , or advisers , able to answer any questions .
",
10475,0,," the quality of healthcare will be improved as workers in remote locations are given access to information and correct answers for diagnosis .
",
10476,0,," a global pool of skills can be drawn upon , and utilised , when required .
",
10477,0,," the use of mobile clinics and ict in health not only tackles issues around location accessibility to health , by travelling into remote areas , but also the flexibility provided through the clinics mobility means a larger population can be seen and treated .
",
10478,0,," virtual doctors are flexible ; one doctor can be providing his or her expertise through numerous local doctors and nurses at any time .
",
10479,0,," they can help staff with much less training make the correct decisions .
",
10480,0,," by using mobile clinics the location is flexible - and can be altered depending on variations in social need and seasons - , and the time individuals can access the clinic is flexible .
",
10481,0,," mobile clinics are more responsive to demand .
",
10482,0,," each mobile clinic will be equipped with vital tools and equipment , and staffed with a medical assistant , a midwife/nurse , and project officer .
",
10483,0,," furthermore , the presence of a medical staff team means a number of services can be provided for women , men , and children .
",
10484,0,," the team are able to carry out tests on the ground , and if required refer the patient to a hospital .
",
10485,0,," referrals are made by the staff , with all required information passed on to the hospital and an appropriate appointment made .
",
10486,0,," the vdp makes each actor within the referral and treatment process aware of their position and role .
",
10487,0,," the vdp appropriately delegates jobs ; thus improving the system of hospital referrals and minimising unnecessary costs from inappropriate referrals .
",
10488,0,," not only does vdp improve access to primary health care but the networks developed between different health advisers mean changing health demands can be met .
",
10489,0,," across africa there is now a shift in the type of diseases prevalent .
",
10490,0,," increasing rates of non-communicable disease are being recorded - for which advisers can provide ongoing support .
",
10491,0,," additionally , there remains a need to improve understanding and treatment of mental health issues within rural areas in particular .
",
10492,0,," concern with mental health requires greater recognition across africa .
",
10493,0,," finally , data can be collected on health issues affecting rural areas for targeted intervention .
",
10494,1,,"while all continents suffer from their own prominent diseases, africa bears a disproportionate burden.
",
10495,1,," the continents holds 11% of the population, but has 25% of the world’s disease burden.
",
10496,1,," while hiv and malaria are well known, other common deadly diseases such as measles and pneumonia are also prominent on the continent; all of which are exacerbated by high levels of malnutrition.
",
10497,1,," hiv/aids alone cost the lives of around 1.2 million africans in 2012, 75% of the global deaths to the disease.
",
10498,1,," cheap, generic drugs have been proposed as an answer to this problemmedical drugs take one of two forms.
",
10499,1,," the first is a patented drug, which has been researched and developed (r&d) by a company and cannot legally be reproduced by another company for a set period of time.
",
10500,1,," this allows the initial company to recuperate financial losses for r&d. once the patent ends the information on how to create the drug becomes available to all drug companies.
",
10501,1,," they are generally produced at a lower price due to competition between firms and are called generic drugs.
",
10502,1,," some countries, such india and brazil, have developed a generic drug industry, with africa as a primary market.
",
10503,1,," some legislation in developed countries already provides high quality generic drugs to africa and there are propositions to increase the quantities.
",
10504,1,," there is, however, a conflict of interests between pharmaceutical companies operating for a profit and humanitarians.
",
10505,1,," this examines whether the mass export of high quality generic drugs to africa is a viable and effective option.
",
10506,0,,"    generic drugs are much cheaper to produce , which is ideal for africa 's struggling population .
",
10507,0,," while there has been significant gross domestic product , gdp , growth in africa , the actual distribution of wealth is relatively unequal .
",
10508,0,," according to afrobarometer ,% of africans still feel that their economic condition is poor .
",
10509,0,," this restricts their ability to purchase high cost drugs .
",
10510,0,," generic medication would reduce the price of these drugs , making them affordable to the average citizen .
",
10511,0,," the patented drug glivec , used for cancer treatment , costs # 48.62 formg in south africa while its generic equivalent , produced in india , costs # 4.82 .
",
10512,0,," increased access will result in higher levels of treatment , which in turn will reduce death rates from preventable diseases in africa .
",
10513,0,," the decreased cost of pharmaceuticals allows african states to focus on other aspects of medical schemes .
",
10514,0,," pharmaceuticals are not the only aspect in treatment , there needs to be sufficient staff , medical equipment and infrastructure .
",
10515,0,," these requirements cost money , which the savings made on pharmaceuticals provide .
",
10516,0,," in europe ,% of dispensed medicines are generic yet they cost only% of pharmaceutical expenditure , with a similar model predicted for south africa .
",
10517,0,," this allows the state to focus on other aspects of medical schemes .
",
10518,0,," the increased availability of high quality generic drugs will reduce the numbers of bad and fake pharmaceuticals on the markets .
",
10519,0,," the cost of patented drugs has forced many to search for other options .
",
10520,0,," this is exploited by the billion dollar global counterfeit drug trade .
",
10521,0,," fake drugs are the cause of around 100,000 deaths in africa every year .
",
10522,0,," bad drugs , which are substandard , have also found their way in to africa ; one in six tuberculosis pills have been found to be of a poor quality .
",
10523,0,," the widespread introduction of low cost , high quality drugs will hopefully ensure that consumers do not turn to sellers in market places .
",
10524,0,," it is unrealistic to expect poorer countries , such as those in africa , to pay the same price as the developed world 's markets .
",
10525,0,," current patent laws for many countries dictate that prices for buying patented drugs should be universally the same .
",
10526,0,," this makes it extremely difficult for african countries to purchase pharmaceuticals set at the market price of developed countries .
",
10527,0,," in the us there are nine patented drugs which cost in excess of $ 200,000 .
",
10528,0,," to expect developing african states to afford this price is unfair and reinforces the exploitative relationship between the developed and developing world .
",
10529,0,," generic drugs escape this problem due to their universally low prices .
",
10530,1,,"the commitment to improving healthcare can be seen by the prevalence of health indicators in the millennium development goals (mdg).
",
10531,1,," this has resulted in innovative models, and thinking, on healthcare.
",
10532,1,," the mdg provide a means for monitoring national progress in tackling multiple dimensions of poverty.
",
10533,1,," the defined goals encourage intervention to enable equality in health care, ensure a healthy population, and promote healthy environments.
",
10534,1,," however, sub-saharan africa continues to be far from reaching the mdg targets (undp, 2013).
",
10535,1,,"in seeking to achieve the predefined goals the role of the private sector has received increasing attention.
",
10536,1,," questions have been raised as to what the private sector can do to assist in eradicating poverty; how the private-sector is enticing innovative models of care; and why targeting the goals need to move beyond state intervention.
",
10537,1,," the private-sector has played a key role within the distribution, and provision, of health care in africa(mckinsey, 2007).
",
10538,1,," further, the rise of an urban middle class has encouraged a new market towards care.
",
10539,1,," willing to pay for care and demanding better care, the middle-class are encouraging a shift towards continuing privatisation.
",
10540,1,,"this focuses on the relation between health and privatisation.
",
10541,1,," with the public-sector underfunding health care, and a rise in consumers opting for private healthcare, what conclusions can be made?
",
10542,1,," the debate returns to the issue of social policy in africa - its importance and the need for new ideas.
",
10543,0,," sub-saharan africa accounts for% of the global disease burden ; but only% of global health expenditure and% of the world 's health workers , mckinsey and company  .
",
10544,0,," $ 25-30bn is required to invest in healthcare assets in the next decade to meet needs , mckinsey and company  .
",
10545,0,," public resources are not available , so the private-sector is critical .
",
10546,0,," the private sector can help fill this funding gap ; private-sector actors - including actis - are planning to invest $ 1.2 bn into adcock ingram to provide and supply drugs .
",
10547,0,," the investment will provide key funding to enable research ; and the availability for art within adcock ingram 's anti-retroviral portfolio .
",
10548,0,," to combat hiv , and other diseases , investors are required for r&d and the distribution of drugs .
",
10549,0,," in, only% of the people living with hiv in low and middle-income countries had access to art showing how necessary such investment is .
",
10550,0,," furthermore , the private-sector have established partnerships to implement training programmes , improving qualified treatment for hiv , tb and malaria .
",
10551,0,," private-sector investment will provide crucial training for health professionals , infrastructure , and resources to improve maternal and child health care .
",
10552,0,," providing affordable maternal care acts as a means for promoting gender equality , and empowerment .
",
10553,0,," jacaranda health operate on a business model , meeting the demand , and need , for affordable and high-quality maternal care in east africa .
",
10554,0,," through mobile clinics and new maternity hospitals jacaranda health is empowering women and children .
",
10555,0,," within the first year jacaranda health provided care for 4,000 women , and changed the lives of 20,000 families .
",
10556,0,," additionally , free maternal care holds negative side-effects .
",
10557,0,," as burundi shows , the social policy ideas implementing ` free ' maternal health care resulted in overburdening the health resources and understaffed facilities ; and putting vulnerable children at greater risk , irin  .
",
10558,0,," private health is enabling improved access to health services in neglected areas and reducing disparities in access to health .
",
10559,0,," in sub-saharan africa rural-urban disparities in health-care have received increasing attention .
",
10560,0,," private investment is bringing services to remote locations .
",
10561,0,," the potential role of technology companies bringing healthcare to areas without it is showcased in samsung 's investment in mobile solar-powered clinics in rural south africa .
",
10562,0,," mobile technology is providing crucial innovations ; used as tools by private investors , mobiles mean individuals can be updated on health status and preventative practices without physical access to doctors , or nurses .
",
10563,1,,"current drugs policy in many western countries is loosely based on the principle that drugs are criminalised in proportion to their harmfulness.
",
10564,1,," typically, whilst alcohol and nicotine are legal, a wide variety of other stimulants and narcotics (for example, heroin, cocaine, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines) are deemed illegal.
",
10565,1,," usually the penalty attached to possession of these drugs varies according to their perceived harmfulness; for example, a “hard” drug like heroin attracts harsher punishment than a “soft” drug like cannabis.
",
10566,1,," supplying others with a drug also usually attracts a harsher penalty than possessing a small amount for purely personal use.
",
10567,1,," some countries, such as the uk, attempt to codify harmfulness by operating a grading system for illegal drugs (‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’); in others, assumptions about harmfulness are expressed through policing and sentencing policy.
",
10568,1,,"across the world, approaches to drugs vary, from liberal policies in the netherlands where many “soft” drugs are in effect tolerated, to the harsh policies of singapore, which hands out the death penalty for certain drug-related crimes.
",
10569,1,," however, “hard” drugs such as heroin and cocaine are pretty much universally illegal.
",
10570,1,," in debating this topic, the proposition needs to be clear about the implications of their case; typically they need to argue for the legalisation of “hard” drugs as well as “soft” ones.
",
10571,1,," they may also wish to present some kind of model or plan whereby the quality and marketing of drugs is regulated (for example, in ways similar to controls on tobacco and alcohol in many countries).
",
10572,0,," individuals are sovereign over their own bodies , and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals .
",
10573,0,," since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective , it is not up to the state to legislate in this area .
",
10574,0,," rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use , the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs .
",
10575,0,," those who want to use drugs will take them whether they are legal or not -- and more are doing so than ever before .
",
10576,0,," inthere was something like 1,000 problematic drug users in the uk , now there are over 250,000 .
",
10577,0,," legalization will also remove the glamour which surrounds an underground activity and so make drug use less attractive to impressionable teenagers .
",
10578,0,," for example , statistics suggest that cannabis use in the uk declined after its classification was lowered from ` b ' to ` c ' .
",
10579,0,," currently in the uk , purity of illegal amphetamine is normally under% , and some tablets sold as ecstasy contain no mdma at all .
",
10580,0,," instead , drugs are adulterated , `` cut '' , with substances from chalk and talcum powder to completely different drugs .
",
10581,0,," at least when drugs are legalised the state can regulate their sale to make sure that they are clean and not cut with other dangerous substances .
",
10582,0,," this will minimise the risk to users .
",
10583,0,," the illegality of drugs fuels a huge amount of crime that could be eliminated if drugs were legalised .
",
10584,0,," price controls would mean that addicts would no longer have to steal to fund their habits , and a state-provided drug services would put dealers out of business , starving criminal gangs of their main source of funding .
",
10585,0,," for example , an italian mafia family were making around $ 44bn a year from cocaine smuggling .
",
10586,0,," this represents something like% of italy 's entire gdp -- and that from only one crime syndicate .
",
10587,0,," the taliban gets most of its revenue from poppies , which provide the opium for heroin .
",
10588,0,," they do this by intimidating local farmers who would otherwise sell their harvest at market .
",
10589,0,," they then demand `` protection money '' as well , or else either another local warlord or the ` protectors ' themselves would rob the farmer .
",
10590,0,," something like 22,700 people have died in mexico since januaryfrom gangsters who want to protect their revenue and almost the entire continent of south america , from brazil to colombia , has had their governments destabilised by drug lords .
",
10591,0,," the hugely-costly but unsuccessful war on drugs could be ended , starving terrorists of the profits of drug production .
",
10592,0,," as a result peace and development could be brought to unstable drug-producing states such as colombia and afghanistan .
",
10593,0,," in most countries where drugs are illegal , tobacco and alcohol , which arguably have equally devastating consequences in society , are legal .
",
10594,0,," in a uk study , alcohol was shown to have the worst effects of any drug , yet the current law recognises that people should be able to choose whether they drink or not .
",
10595,0,," the same should be true of drugs .
",
10596,0,," in 2009-2010 , the tax revenue from tobacco in the uk was # 10.5 billion .
",
10597,0,," if the state legalizes drugs , it can tax them and use the revenue from this practise to fund treatment .
",
10598,0,," at the moment such treatment is difficult to justify as it appears to be spending ordinary taxpayers ' money on junkies .
",
10599,1,,"the us guantanamo bay detention facility in cuba is operated by the joint task force guantanamo of the american armed force with the primary purpose of acting as a detention facility for ""terrorist suspects"" captured in the us war on terror, particularly in afghanistan and iraq.
",
10600,1,," it holds approximatelyinmates defined under the bush administration as ""enemy combatants"".
",
10601,1,," following years of  legitimacy of the detention facility and the legal rights of detainees, president barack obama announced onjanuarythat he was suspending all ongoing military tribunals, and that the detention facility would be shut down within the year.
",
10602,1,," this action has renewed  pros and cons of the detention facility, and whether or not a similar detention facility and/or legal apparatus should replace the facility elsewhere.
",
10603,1,," on the one hand of the debate, supporters of the camp claim that it is a necessary evil that acts not only to deter terrorist activities, but also to disrupt the coordination of their various splinter groups.
",
10604,1,," on the other hand, the camps effectiveness may not justify the numerous breaches of human rights and the violations of international law that have been claimed against it.
",
10605,1,," questions over whether the detainees can bring forward a writ of habeas corpus to force a hearing on their state are also intrinsic to the debate.
",
10606,0,," additional questions include whether the detention of foreign nationals, on the basis that they are a threat to america, is sufficient justification for guantanamo’s permanent presence.
",
10607,0,,"prisoners have been detained at guantanamo for long periods without clear charges being filed and without trial .
",
10608,0,," this is a violation of the international legal principle of habeas corpus .
",
10609,0,," one of the primary problems is that , without clear charges and a presentation of evidence against a suspect , the suspect can not contest the charges and prove their own innocence .
",
10610,0,," and , as a matter of fact , numerous detainees have been found innocent , but only after excessively long periods without being charged or brought before a court .
",
10611,0,," many guantanamo detainees may have never committed terrorist acts or fought against us forces in afghanistan at all ; they were simply turned over by northern alliance and pakistani warlords for bounties of up to $ 25,000 .
",
10612,0,," for almost seven years they have been held without a fair hearing or opportunity to demonstrate those facts .
",
10613,0,," courts who reviewed the cases ofdetainees to see if there was reasonable evidence for their continued detention found no credible basis for detainingof them .
",
10614,0,," other detainees were captured in places where , at the time of their arrest , there was no armed conflict involving us forces .
",
10615,0,," the case of the six men of algerian origin detained in bosnia and herzegovina in octoberis a well-known and well-documented example .
",
10616,0,," therefore the only way to resolve these issues is to try all the detainees at guantanamo bay in us courts , and release any against whom charges can not be brought .
",
10617,0,," former us secretary of defense colin powell has endorsed this reasoning , arguing that `` i would get rid of guantanamo and the military commission system and use established procedures in federal law ... , it 's a more equitable way , and more understandable in constitutional terms , '' us courts are fully capable of dealing with terrorist trials , as shown by the fact that they have renderedconvictions in terror-related cases in the past .
",
10618,0,," convictions in us courts would probably be seen internationally as having more legitimacy than those obtained through the current system of military tribunals , which is often viewed as rigged against the defendants .
",
10619,0,," only by allowing full due process in american courts can the rights of the detainees be uaranteed and their guilt or innocence truly established .
",
10620,0,," the existence of guantanamo bay is cited by terrorists as a tool of `` the great satan '' and is seen by muslims in general as a demonstration of us disregard for their dignity .
",
10621,0,," it is , in turn , an effective tool used by terrorists and jihadists to bring recruits on-board .
",
10622,0,," the highly unpopular existence of guantanamo bay also makes it more risky for intelligence sources to come out and provide useful information that they might otherwise be willing to provide .
",
10623,0,," this is because , for many muslims , guantánamo stands as a confirmation of the low regard in which they believe the united states holds them .
",
10624,0,," some of this stems from the association of detention at guantanamo with the specifically anti-islamic abuses which have reportedly occurred there , such as allegations of having a guard dog carry the koran in its mouth , guards scrawling obscenities inside korans , kicking korans across the floor , urinating on the koran , ridiculing the koran , walking on the koran , and tearing off the cover and throwing the koran into trash or dirty water .
",
10625,0,," these associations not only make it easier for terrorists to recruit by inciting anti-american sentiments , but also harm the us ' ability to argue that the war on terror is not directed against all muslims .
",
10626,0,," president obama announced inthat closing the guantanamo bay detention centre would allow the us to reclaim the moral high ground and thus better prosecute the war on terror . ''

",
10632,0,," , un reports indicate that the treatment of detainees since their arrests , and the conditions of their confinement , have had profound effects on the mental health of many of them .
",
10633,0,," the treatment and conditions include the capture and transfer of detainees to an undisclosed overseas location , sensory deprivation and other abusive treatment during transfer ; detention in cages without proper sanitation and exposure to extreme temperatures ; minimal exercise and hygiene ; systematic use of coercive interrogation techniques ; long periods of solitary confinement ; cultural and religious harassment ; denial of or severely delayed communication with family ; and the uncertainty generated by the indeterminate nature of confinement and denial of access to independent tribunals .
",
10634,0,," these conditions have led in some instances to serious mental illness , overacts of self-harm inalone , individual and mass suicide attempts and widespread , prolonged hunger strikes .
",
10635,0,," the severe mental health consequences are likely to be long term in many cases , creating health burdens on detainees and their families for years to come .
",
10636,0,," such conditions are clearly not acceptable to a nation such as the us which prides itself on its justice system and respect for human rights .
",
10637,0,," the detention centre must be closed to the us can end its association with such practices .
",
10638,1,,"everyone talks about 'rights', 'human rights' and 'fundamental rights', but do they even exist?
",
10639,1,," can we ever really know what they are?
",
10640,1,," are they objective facts, or are they just products of our time and culture?
",
10641,1,," what about competing ideas and definitions of human rights?
",
10642,1,," various attempts have been made to codify universal or fundamental human rights, but there exists no universally-followed list of rights.
",
10643,1,," our current conception of human rights has in one sense its origins in the conceptions of the 'rights of man' which emerged during the enlightenment, but owes most of its current form and content to ideas which emerged in the wake of the second world war, as embodied in the united nations'universal declaration of human rights, which listed a large number of political, economic and social rights supposedly universally held by all people everywhere.
",
10644,1,," this conception of human rights has been criticised, however, and the very idea of universal or fundamental human rights is by no means universally accepted by all nations and societies.
",
10645,0,," fundamental human rights exist and are founded on universal human needs .
",
10646,0,," certain needs are necessary to human life in every instance and circumstance .
",
10647,0,," these include food , water , shelter and security of person .
",
10648,0,," human life is not possible without any one of these things , and so these needs may be termed ` fundamental rights ' necessary to the continued existence of that person .
",
10649,0,," every person has a right to the fulfilment of these needs as the alternative is non-existence , which is contrary to our basic human nature to survive .
",
10650,0,," because all humans everywhere possess at birth a drive to survive and all share these requirements , they are clearly fundamental to our nature and we have a right to their fulfilment and protection .
",
10651,0,," certain desires , such as the desire for happiness , are universal to all human beings .
",
10652,0,," even if they actively deny them to others , every individual works towards the fulfilment of these desires for himself , and recognise that the denial of this fulfilment is harmful to himself .
",
10653,0,," for example historically slave-owners still desired freedom of movement and labour for themselves , even if they denied it to their slaves on the basis of selfish interests .
",
10654,0,," therefore , because all humans desire happiness for themselves , and also desire the means to this end such as freedom of speech and the freedom to make their own choices , there exists a universal basis of desire for human rights in every individual .
",
10655,0,," the enshrinement of ` fundamental human rights ' simply universalizes what every individual acknowledges for himself : that the denial of certain rights is always harmful .
",
10656,0,," this already even has a basis in the ` golden rule ' , to not do what is harmful to yourself to others , which can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition .
",
10657,0,," all humans benefit from the protection of the human rights of others .
",
10658,0,," for example , a society which guarantees the security of person for all its inhabitants means every individual can feel assured of their safety and thus live a happier and more productive life , whereas in a society where this was not guaranteed to all , everyone would have to live in fear of their person being violated in the present if they can not guarantee their own security , or in the future if they should lose the ability to protect themselves which they may enjoy in the present .
",
10659,0,," this fear would lower the quality of life for all , and make society worse .
",
10660,0,," therefore , it could be argued that , even if fundamental human rights do not exist , it is still beneficial for us to believe in them and protect them , as we are all better off as a consequence .
",
10661,0,," this applies internationally as well ; the conception of universal human rights which everyone possesses has meant that many modern instances of humanitarian disasters , such as the 1984-1985 famine in somalia , have been met with a vigorous response by nations , groups and individuals concerned with human rights , helping to alleviate the human suffering there .
",
10662,0,," this can be compared to historical examples in times when there was less concern with universal human rights and where therefore much less action was taken to alleviate famines and human suffering , such as occurred in the irish potato famine betweenand.
",
10663,1,,"capital punishment is always controversial: for that reason, it is commonly used as a training debate.
",
10664,1,," however, on the international level, its use in africa is not a matter of debate as much as it is in the usa (the last western highly developed democracy to maintain capital punishment), or asian nations such as china, the country that performs more executions than the rest of the world put together.
",
10665,1,," in general, the same fundamental arguments about penology (the social science of punishment) and criminology (the study of crime) apply worldwide - for that reason, this debate aims to avoid regurgitating the stock arguments and focus on the particular context of capital punishment in africa.
",
10666,1,," in 2012, executions were carried out in sudan (including on opposition activists), south sudan, somalia, botswana and the gambia.
",
10667,1,," death sentences were also imposed in a number of other countries, including egypt, dr congo, ghana, kenya, mali, nigeria, tanzania and zimbabwe.
",
10668,1,,"a particular example of a country that abolished capital punishment in africa is south africa.
",
10669,1,," while there was a moratorium instituted in 1990, south africa is the only country in africa where capital punishment was abolished following the decision of a court (state v makwanyane in 1995).
",
10670,1,," the makwanyane decision came in the years following the nation’s transition to democracy after the collapse of white minority rule, an era during which there were a number of executions for politically motivated offences, including that of anti-apartheid activists frederick john harris and vuyisile mini.
",
10671,1,," this position is despite south africa having relatively high levels of violent crime, and significant levels of public support.
",
10672,1,,"most recently benin abolished capital punishment in 2012, as did burundi in 2009.
",
10673,1,," however, the gambia has moved towards a different direction.
",
10674,1,," in 2012, the gambia carried out nine executions; it’s first since 1985, following a “promise” to execute just under fifty convicts made by the president, yahya jammeh.
",
10675,0,," capital punishment is , in general seen as a significant human rights violation by the international community - not only most liberal democracies , but much of international civil society .
",
10676,0,," abolition will help lead to the development of a culture of human rights and the rule of law by acting as a benchmark of progress , and a symbol of a commitment to these principles .
",
10677,0,," it is notable that guinea bissau is the only abolitionist nation in the bottom ten countries in africa for the rule of law -- according to the ibrahim index of african governance 's safety and rule of law category , compared to six abolitionist countries in the top ten .
",
10678,0,," crime does not stop at national borders .
",
10679,0,," therefore efforts to fight crime can not , either .
",
10680,0,," a country that abolishes capital punishment will be in a much better position to cooperate on justice issues internationally .
",
10681,0,," many states , particularly ones in the global north , have policies of not extraditing people to jeopardy of capital punishment .
",
10682,0,," not only could more people be extradited , foreign states may be more willing to provide broader based assistance and co-operation if they see that a state has made steps forward in criminal justice policy .
",
10683,0,," some states have a policy of not extraditing to states where there is a risk of capital punishment : a particular clause on this is included in the us-mexico extradition treaty , and it is the position of the european court of human rights .
",
10684,0,," european states in particular put a particular emphasis on capital punishment when determining human rights issues for foreign policy .
",
10685,0,," the uk for example has a policy of promoting and lobbying for the abolition of capital punishment with foreign governments .
",
10686,0,," this will help generate goodwill for the nation .
",
10687,0,," this could have a whole myriad of benefits - from aid and trade , to being seen as the `` good guy '' in any international disputes .
",
10688,0,," when using capital punishment the opposite is the case ; controversy has been created by the use of un resources in drugs cases in vietnam that could lead to executions for drug offences .
",
10689,1,,"a hate crime is a crime, usually violent, motivated by prejudice or intolerance toward a member of a gender, racial, religious, or social group.
",
10690,1,," in this resolution, hate crime ""enhancements"" refer to a court’s power to impose a heavier sentence on an offender if it is shown that his crime was motivated by racial hatred or other prejudices.
",
10691,1,," for example, normal graffiti would not be punished severely, but if a swastika was sprayed onto a jewish temple, there is clear racial motive behind the crime and it would attract a much more severe sentence.
",
10692,1,," this pertains to all other aspects of crime, i.e. a lynching would be punished much more severely than a regular homicide.
",
10693,1,," most western liberal democracies' justice systems recognize hate crimes and punish them more severely.
",
10694,0,," hate crime enhancements are unjust because they respond to two equal results , i.e. assault vs. racial mugging , with different punishments .
",
10695,0,," we need to judge solely on the concrete actions of the aggressor in order to prevent punishments from being based on arbitrary judgements as to an offender 's `` intent '' , which can be very difficult to prove .
",
10696,0,," otherwise `` intent '' may be supposed or argued in cases where it did not exist , leading to perverse sentencing whereby a crime is punished more harshly despite the true absence of intent .
",
10697,0,," there is a danger of unjustly branding someone as bigoted and punishing them excessively , e.g. for their involvement in a bar fight where the victim coincidentally belonged to a minority group .
",
10698,0,," juries might also be willing to make the logical leap that , because the aggressor was proved to hold bigoted views in general towards his victim 's ethnic group , these views must have motivated his actions in this individual incident , despite the absence of any evidence linking the specific brawl in a bar to the aggressor 's views .
",
10699,0,," therefore it is unjust to punish two crimes with equal effects differently on the highly subjective basis of `` intent '' , and thus hate crime enhancements are unjust .
",
10700,0,," hate crimes are crimes that are based on an idea that the perpetrator had prior to the crime .
",
10701,0,," the crime itself is no different from any other crime except that it is punished more harshly .
",
10702,0,," why is this so ?
",
10703,0,," because we are punishing an idea .
",
10704,0,," all forms of violent crime , whether they are murders , rapes , or beatings are an expression of hatred toward another human being .
",
10705,0,," to add more punishment to a crime because it represents a particular kind of hate , an idea , is to unfairly distinguish between different violent acts and trivialize those violent acts that do not appear to be motivated by prejudice hate .
",
10706,0,," this is unjust because the idea itself does not cause harm , and is in fact legal in most cases , with the exception of direct incitement to violence , as racist or prejudiced statements and ideas are not illegal in most western liberal democracies .
",
10707,0,," we allow extreme and prejudiced ideas to be legal because we recognise the value of free speech and open discourse in debating and discussing ideas , so as to best allow for progress in human thought .
",
10708,0,," hate crime enhancements constitute an attack on this as they make an individual liable for harsher punishments for his actions if he holds certain views , and thus the law unfairly discriminates against these particular viewpoints and not against others , and so hate crime enhancements are unjust .
",
10709,0,," by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another , rather than as being committed by individuals against their society , the labelling of crimes as `` hate crimes '' causes groups to feel persecuted by one another , and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime .
",
10710,0,,"  these effects spread beyond the hate crimes themselves .
",
10711,0,," by prosecuting high-profile cases of white hate crimes against blacks , for example , it encourages blacks to see themselves as part of a distinct community different from the white community and whose relations are marked by crimes committed by one against the other .
",
10712,0,," this is especially true when one community seems to perpetrate more hate crime , or at least more convictions thereof are secured , against another community than visa-versa .
",
10713,0,," an analysis of hate crime date from the usa examining how hate crimes against whites are viewed with respect to hate crimes against blacks has hypothesised that the prevailing view in the minds of the public is that the crime that whites are most likely to commit against blacks is a hate crime , and that it is hard for most americans to envision a white person committing a crime against a black person for a different reason .
",
10714,0,," the only white people who commit crimes against black people , goes the public belief , are racially prejudiced white extremists , and in contrast the very idea of hate crimes committed against whites is met with scepticism and disbelief .
",
10715,0,,"  there have been several high-profile cases in the usa where some individuals have argued actual hate crimes against whites were not treated as such as a consequence of such public disbelief .
",
10716,0,,"  this can lead to an unjust situation where hate crime enhancements are , or are perceived as being , only applied `` against '' one community by another , despite hate crimes actually being committed by individuals within both communities against other individuals .
",
10717,0,," therefore hate crime enhancements are unjust .
",
10718,1,,"on the 26th februarythe ukrainian parliament voted to send the country’s president viktor yanukovych to the icc in the hague.
",
10719,1,,"  and he is not the only one; at the same time they have also voted that the former interior minister vitali zakharchenko and the prosecutor general, viktor pshonka should also be tried by the icc.
",
10720,1,," this is for “crimes against humanity during peaceful protests in ukraine since november 30,until february 22, 2014”.
",
10721,1,,"the protests were the result of the president deciding on 21st novembernot to agree a trade and association agreement with the eu and instead turn towards russia.
",
10722,1,," yanukovych’s actions may have been pragmatic - ukraine needed money and russia was willing to provide while the eu was not but the opposition took to the streets.
",
10723,1,," the result was months of standoff with some violence.
",
10724,1,," on the 16th january the ukranian parliament attempted to end the protests by passing anti-protest laws which included banning any rallys, vaguely defined extremist activity, and clamping down on freedom of speech and the press.
",
10725,1,," the result was the protests became riots and occupations of government buildings.
",
10726,1,,"throughout the protests there had been attacks, disappearances, and beatings of protestors, but on 18th february protestors advanced on ukraine’s parliament sparking three days of serious violence.
",
10727,1,," the police used rubber bullets and live ammunition including sniper fire and automatic weapons.
",
10728,1,," on the 20th riot police attempted to regain lost ground and the minister of the interior zakharchenko stated “law enforcement officers have received service firearms and will use them in accordance with ukraine’s law on police” so authorising the use of firearms to beat back the protesters.
",
10729,1,," the health ministry said there weredead andwounded in the three days of fighting, though the toll may well have been higher.
",
10730,1,,"the next day yanukovych agreed to mediation by the french, german and polish foreign ministers leading to a deal between the opposition and the president.
",
10731,1,," the deal restored theconstitution, provided an amnesty to protestors and promised elections.
",
10732,1,," despite it seeming to be a deal to stop violence rather than change government yanukovych decided the game was up and fled with the ukrainian parliament and the protestors taking over control.
",
10733,1,,"in the short term a trial in either the hague or ukraine is unlikely; he has turned up in moscow.
",
10734,1,," russia has agreed to give yanukovych protection so is unlikely to extradite him, especially as he is still a useful player as he still claims to be the president, and until a new election he has some justification to do so.
",
10735,1,," yanukovych himself says “the ukrainian parliament is illegitimate” before adding that “decisions taken in parliament were taken under duress” so any attempt to try him is as illegitimate as the takeover.
",
10736,0,,"  even before most of the violence by riot police in february some experts were suggesting that yanukovych had committed crimes against humanity -- crimes committed by a state against a civilian population .
",
10737,0,," professor alexander j motyl argued `` the yanukovych regime may already be guilty of `` imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law '' and `` persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender ... or other grounds . ''''
",
10738,0,," now at the very least murder can be added to that count .
",
10739,0,," having the icc prosecute yanukovych currently faces a major difficulty ; ukraine has not ratified the rome statute .
",
10740,0,," it is therefore outside the jurisdiction of the court .
",
10741,0,," technically this means the parliament ca n't ask for icc prosecution as there is no state party to refer the situation to the prosecutor .
",
10742,0,," clearly there is an easy solution to this ; ukraine should ratify the statute .
",
10743,0,," this would have the benefit of reaffirming international criminal law , showing that it can be beneficial in a crisis , and increasing it as an accepted norm .
",
10744,0,," justice is about the past .
",
10745,0,," but when prosecuting someone there also needs to be a thought for the present and the future of the country .
",
10746,0,," in the case of prosecuting yanukovych there could be serious consequences as he had support in one half of the country .
",
10747,0,," ukraine is a divided country with many in the east considering themselves to not be ukrainian , and certainly look to moscow not the eu .
",
10748,0,," the new administration has already abolish a law that made russian a second language in the country so infringing the rights of many in the east .
",
10749,0,," trying a former leader in kiev would be similarly provocative to those who believe yanukovych is still the legitimate president , or even those who may not agree with yanukovych but dislike the westward movement even more .
",
10750,0,," while it would be unlikely to cause conflict on its own the action would certainly be an aggravating factor if other actions against the east of the country are being taken .
",
10751,0,," justice for yanukovych should be international simply because it would be a much better guarantor of a fair trial .
",
10752,0,," the ukrainian justice system is unfortunately corrupt , and at the behest of prosecutors ; it has an amazing conviction rate of 99.8 % .
",
10753,0,," this is because judges are they are only appointed for five years then the government confirms tenure if it believes they have been voting the right way .
",
10754,0,," yulia tymoshenko , an opponent of yanukovych , was imprisoned for making a deal with president putin to ensure gas supplies -- something that was a humanitarian necessity to ensure russia did not freeze ukraine into submission .
",
10755,1,,"one of the leading disputes surrounding modern international criminal law is how best to deal with the crimes of repressive regimes that have been overthrown.
",
10756,1,," some advocate for the prosecutions of the offenders.
",
10757,1,," with the establishment of stronger international bodies such as the international criminal court and ad hoc tribunals such as the international criminal tribunals for the former yugoslavia and rwanda such prosecutions have become easier to implement.
",
10758,1,," the international criminal court (icc)  began in 2002, formed under the rome statute  to try the most serious of war crimes when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves.
",
10759,1,," the icc is an independent international organisation, outside of the united nations system, and runs on funding from state parties.
",
10760,1,," in order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the icc needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the united nations security council (being made up by the us, france, russia, china and the uk), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves.
",
10761,1,," it is therefore now available new regimes to refer their predecessors for prosecution if they have committed crimes against humanity or other war crimes; there has been a suggestion by geoffrey robertson that it might be the best place to try those who ordered attacks on protestors in ukraine during the winter of 2014.
",
10762,1,,"[1]others however advocate for more reconciliatory approaches, such as amnesties, truth and reconciliation commissions and inquests.
",
10763,1,,"  an amnesty is an agreement with dictators and leaders who might otherwise be prosecuted that they will not be tried for crimes if they give up power.
",
10764,1,," truth and reconciliation commissions (trc) can also offer amnesties, in exchange for testimony.
",
10765,1,," they serve to provide a forum where both perpetrators and victims give their stories of the conflict, with the aim of providing restorative justice, or breaking down ethnic tensions.
",
10766,1,," the most high profile trc to date occurred in south africa at the conclusion of the apartheid era.
",
10767,0,," this case will ask whether seeking prosecutions are beneficial with the healing process, and will compare with the alternatives.
",
10768,0,,"prosecutions are the only way for victims to see those who caused pain against them brought to justice .
",
10769,0,," the alternative of some kind of reconciliation often leaves those who perpetrated crimes able to retain power as has happened in countries like bosnia and herzegovina , colombia and guatemala  .
",
10770,0,," when this happens there is clearly a concern both that these individuals are not being held to account and that they could act in a similar way again if given the opportunity .
",
10771,0,," under the united nations genocide convention of, victims have a right to see offenders prosecuted  .
",
10772,0,," and it is only prosecution that will ensure that such acts can not occur again so giving peace of mind to victims .
",
10773,0,,"  akhavan , payam , ` beyond impunity : can international criminal justice prevent future atrocities ' american journal of international law ,  pp.7-31 prosecuting offenders is the only way to get a just outcome when there have been horrific crimes committed .
",
10774,0,," at a most principled level , those who commit a crime ought to be held accountable for their actions even if they are powerful or it damages the chances of peace because the powerful must be shown not to be above the law .
",
10775,0,," even where the law did not exist , or the leaders were in control of the law , international norms provide a standard for what actions merit prosecution , and judiciaries have been very good at convicting those who committed atrocities  .
",
10776,0,," having those who committed crimes convicted by law courts helps prevent those affected by atrocities holding grudges and put the past behind them so aiding the healing process  .
",
10777,0,,"  moore , john j jr ` problems with forgiveness 'stanford law review, februaryby introducing internationally based prosecution , the laws are able to effectively filter down into the domestic system .
",
10778,0,," the international system takes care of powerful offenders who might otherwise not receive a fair trial or be brought to justice .
",
10779,0,," this then allows domestic courts to prosecute those involved in the crimes at a lower level .
",
10780,0,," this has worked in ivory coast where the former leader was brought to face charges committed at home and also helped stabilize the situation in the country  .
",
10781,0,," by prosecuting those who commit crimes against humanity and war crimes future leaders are dissuaded from committing such acts  .
",
10782,0,," when criminals are held accountable , the belief in the reliability of the legal system is enhanced , society is strengthened by the experience that the legal system is able to defend itself and the sense of justice is upheld or rectified  .
",
10783,0,," since the office of the prosecutor announced its interest in colombia in, the government has taken a number of measures particularly the peace and justice law to ensure domestic prosecution of those who could potentially be tried by the icc .
",
10784,0,," the threat of icc prosecution appears to have concerned former president pastrana .
",
10785,0,," vincente castrano , auc , a paramilitary leader was fearful of the possibility of icc prosecution , a fear that reportedly directly contributed to his group 's demobilisation  .
",
10786,1,,"in its preamble, the rome statute of the international criminal court explicitly stated that its objectives were not limited to investigating and punishing those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes of aggression.
",
10787,1,," “determined to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes”, the states parties to the statute clearly envisaged the court’s punitive powers to have at least some deterrent effect.
",
10788,1,,"in one obvious sense, successful prosecution of criminals prevents them from committing crimes during the term of their imprisonment.
",
10789,1,,"  however, the court’s power to prosecute perpetrators can be conceived as having potential deterrent effects that are specific or general.
",
10790,1,," if a period of imprisonment already imposed on an individual has the effect of deterring that same person from committing any further crimes, this would be a case of quite specific deterrence.
",
10791,1,," but when this more limited deterrence also influences the potential for many others to commit similar crimes, deterrence begins to operate in the much more general sense expressed in the rome statute.
",
10792,1,," in this general sense, a minimal level of deterrence would be expected to depend on widely publicizing the court’s jurisdictional authority, past and present investigations and successful prosecutions.
",
10793,1,,"  other attempts at more specific deterrence have been evident in occasional warnings issued by the icc prosecutor.
",
10794,1,,"  as the icc functions as a court of ‘last resort’, it only begins proceedings when national or regional authorities have failed to take appropriate action.
",
10795,1,," therefore, while the prosecutor may sometimes attempt to directly deter potential crimes by issuing warnings addressed at those already suspected of committing crimes, warnings might also be targeted towards the local authorities.
",
10796,1,," an example of this approach occurred in the prosecutor’s press release onjanuary 2013, urging malian authorities to “put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses” by malian forces.
",
10797,1,,"one of the difficulties in this debate centres on the question of the icc’s potential to deter would-be criminals i. e. those who may otherwise have been influenced to join or collaborate with militia groups whose members have been committing atrocities with impunity.
",
10798,1,," for practical reasons the icc has intentionally sought to restrict its prosecutions to those “most responsible” for the crimes committed.
",
10799,1,,"  this makes it difficult to gather evidence for or against propositions about the number of persons who may have considered participating in such criminal acts but were ultimately deterred by the threat of icc prosecution.
",
10800,0,," while the icc has the power to issue arrest warrants , it does not have the coercive powers to ensure that those warrants are followed .
",
10801,0,," despite the fact that states that are parties to the rome statute are obliged to co-operate with the directions of the court , there have been many instances where such states have failed to pursue those indicted .
",
10802,0,," cases that have been referred to the icc by the united nations security council allows the court to extend its jurisdiction to include un member states that are not parties to the rome statute .
",
10803,0,," this enabled the icc to issue an international warrant for the arrest of sudan 's president al-bashir .
",
10804,0,," yet several of these countries obliged to arrest him have refused when the opportunities have arisen .
",
10805,0,," since becoming operational in marchthe icc has only had one case resulting in a conviction and it is currently being appealed .
",
10806,0,," despite being found guilty of the war crime of recruiting and forcing child soldiers to fight and kill , thomas lubanga was sentenced to justyears imprisonment .
",
10807,0,," lubanga was arrested and sent to the court in march.
",
10808,0,," this single icc conviction and the light sentence imposed are hardly sufficient to deter other warlords from using child soldiers .
",
10809,0,," six years later , in the same country where lubanga 's crimes occurred , thousands of child soldiers are being recruited by various armed groups .
",
10810,0,," by prosecuting only those leaders deemed ` most responsible ' for the crimes in question , the icc is effectively allowing lower-ranked perpetrators to commit crimes with impunity .
",
10811,0,," these rank and file troops generally have little awareness or understanding of international criminal laws .
",
10812,0,," furthermore , just as local domestic laws fail to deter offenders who often commit crimes with little thought of being punished , distant icc threats are even less likely to deter those whose actions are easily manipulated and controlled by militia leaders .
",
10813,0,," child soldiers , in particular , have often been drugged before going into combat .
",
10814,1,,"in his book the death of punishment, robert blecker proposes that prison conditions should vary, based on the offences that a person is convicted of; those who have committed more heinous crimes should have harsher prison conditions.
",
10815,1,," currently prison sentences are calibrated to fit the crime by their length, rather than their conditions.
",
10816,1,,"blecker supports the death penalty for the worst of the worst, but if this is unavailable wishes a separate prison system for them.
",
10817,1,," the system proposed by blecker is a “permanent punitive situation” in which prision would deliberately be make “painful and unpleasant” for those whose crimes are heinous enough that they are “specially condemned by a jury to suffer this fate”, essentially for those who today in the united states would receive the death penalty.
",
10818,1,,"the regime under pps would include the sole food being nutraloaf (euphemistically referred to as “special management meal” by some), a foodstuff made to be tasteless and used as a disciplinary measure: the compatibility of punishing inmates by altering their food intake with the us constitution has been disputed.
",
10819,1,," “we should keep their visits to the constitutional minimum, and none would be contact visits, ever… they would labor daily, and exercise.
",
10820,1,," but they would not be allowed to play.”
",
10821,1,," it goes without saying they would have no access to computers or the tv.
",
10822,1,," blecker proposes placing photographs of the victim of the offence the prisoner was convicted of in their cell, restricting visits the absolute minimum, minimizing showers to once per week, the constitutional minimum exercise and no association with other prisoners.
",
10823,1,,"  blecker singles out for criticism the system of the us where he argues that counterintuitively the worst prisoners get the best treatment in prison.
",
10824,1,," an action that draws blecker’s ire in particular is the sight of prisoners serving life without parole (lwop) playing baseball (note that while lwop is, in theory, the second highest sentence after the death penalty, over 3,000 people in the us are serving lwop for nonviolent drug and property offences.
",
10825,1,," blecker would have such offenses in normal prisons).
",
10826,1,," the problem, in part, is that those who are in prison longest are most able to obtain privileges for good behaviour.
",
10827,1,," even worse is death row as “they have it better than everybody else in the prison” to the point that blecker quotes a lifer saying “i’d be better off killing an officer.
",
10828,1,," get better privileges if they moved me to the row.”
",
10829,1,," this is because the wardens “want to make the time as easy for them as we can because it makes it easy for us if it is easy for them.”
",
10830,1,,"in england and wales, male prisoners are divided in to a number of categories based on factors including the type of crime, duration of sentence, escape risk and potential danger in escape.
",
10831,1,," categories a, b and c are closed prison categories, category d is for those held in open prisons.
",
10832,1,," category a prisoners are subdivided in to further categories based on escape risk.
",
10833,1,," remand prisoners (those who have not been convicted of anything and await trial, but bail has been denied) are generally given some privileges that those convicted don’t have (for example, in general, wearing their own clothes).
",
10834,1,," this is not always the case in the us.
",
10835,0,," retributive theories of justice accept that the reason why a criminal justice exists is to punish offenders -- society declaring its rejection of crime by inflicting deliberately unpleasant punishments .
",
10836,0,," prisons do not reflect this -- a prisoner is a prisoner , and prison officers generally do not care about what offence they are convicted of .
",
10837,0,," their motivation for doing this being to make the prison easier to administrate .
",
10838,0,," `` the past counts '' .
",
10839,0,," if we are making prisoners stay in prison we should make them feel as if they are being punished .
",
10840,0,," this means deprivation of more than just the liberty to move from the prison but also of other luxuries .
",
10841,0,," differences between different categories of prisoner are already accepted in the criminal justice system -- prisoners are generally kept in different conditions due to factors such as escape risk and other factors .
",
10842,0,," for example the uk has open prisons which offer the freedom to move around within the prison and the system is aimed at reintegration so freedoms like alcohol are allowed , as are home visits .
",
10843,0,," once it is accepted that not all prisons and not all prisoners are treated the same then a difference in treatment based on the crime committed makes sense .
",
10844,0,," if that is the case , it could be calibrated that those serving certain sentences for certain offences should be held in certain conditions -- for example , in connecticut , a state that has abolished the death penalty so lwop is the greatest penalty imposed , those serving life without parole are now denied contact visits and are given no more than two hours of recreation per day .
",
10845,0,," worse prison conditions for particular offences would act as a deterrent .
",
10846,0,," if people , in prisons generally and in society as a whole , see that those who are convicted of particularly bad crimes will be deterred from committing those worse crimes .
",
10847,0,," if prison is simply a holding place that prevents people inside from committing crime then it is failing in creating deterrence ; criminals sometimes feel it is better to commit a crime when released in order to get back into prison .
",
10848,0,," katz , levitt , and shustorovich using death rates show how harsh prison conditions are likely to mean lower crime rates overall -- though a doubling of the death rate only reduces the crime rate by a few percentage points .
",
10849,1,,"ariel sharon, who was prime minister of israel fromto 2006, died on the 11th of january 2014, after eight years in a persistent vegetative state due to a massive stroke.
",
10850,1,," sharon, who held positions in israeli governance since 1981, was a highly important figure – but also a highly controversial one.
",
10851,1,," to his supporters, he has been described as the “architect of israel”, and a man who aimed to create a peaceful and sustainable israel.
",
10852,1,," to his opponents, he was a butcher and a war criminal.
",
10853,1,,"initially a member of the pre-independence paramilitary group haganah, which formed the core of the nascent idf when it was formed in 1948, he rose to the rank of major-general, taking part in theconflict (referred to as the war of independence by israelis and the al-nakba – the catastrophe – by the palestinians and others) which lead to the independence and recognition of the state of israel, the suez crisis, the six-day war inin which israel captured the sinai peninsula, gaza strip, west bank and golan heights, and theconflict known variously as the yom kippur war or the october war.
",
10854,1,," this included leadership of unit 101, created inunder orders by then prime minister david ben-gurion to carry out reprisal operations.
",
10855,1,," in october 1953, israeli troops under sharon’s control attacked qibya, a village in the west bank, in whichpeople, mostly women and children, were killed.
",
10856,1,," this was an act of retaliation following attacks from the west bank in which israelis were targeted: sharon wrote in his diary that he was ordered to make the attack “an example for everyone”.
",
10857,1,," these actions were condemned by the un security council.
",
10858,1,,"entering electoral politics inas a member of the israeli legislature, the knesset, for likud, he became the security adviser of pm yitzhak rabin, he had a spell betweenandas minister of defence, during which israel invaded lebanon in 1982, parts of which were occupied until 1985.
",
10859,1,,"during the conflict, kataeb, a lebanese christian militia, lead a massacre of civilians (betweenand 3,500) in the sabra area of beirut, the lebanese capital, and the nearby shalita refugee camp while the idf prevented those in the areas from leaving.
",
10860,1,," in addition to a un commission (and a general assembly vote deeming it an act of genocide), an israeli inquiry, the kahan commission, deemed sharon responsible.
",
10861,1,," he resigned as minister of defence, but remained in government, becoming foreign minister in 1999.
",
10862,1,," he was elected as prime minister in 2001, during his term creating a new party, kadima.
",
10863,1,," while prime minister, he lead a unilateral withdrawal of israeli settlers from the gaza strip.
",
10864,0,," in addition to events mentioned in the introduction , sharon was accused of , along with troops under his command , execution-style killings ofegyptian civilians taken prisoner by the idf in the saini peninsula in- wilful killing of civilians being a war crime as per the fourth geneva convention .
",
10865,0,," the purpose of international criminal law is that individuals are brought to trial to ensure that individuals are held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity : if a person is n't prosecuted , either by a domestic or international court , the credibility of the limits civilized nations place on war is eroded .
",
10866,0,," an international mechanism where sharon would have been able to be tried would be likely to have been one which would have been able to hear cases dealing with the -- serious -- allegations of crimes against humanity and war crimes by various other groups such as the al-qassam brigades , the paramilitary group attached to hamas .
",
10867,0,," this would have been able to prevent further atrocities by acting as a deterrent through punitive methods as well as showing that the law applies to western nations and their allies too .
",
10868,0,," prosecutions by international criminal courts have a positive side-effect of creating a historical record of events .
",
10869,0,," this creates an impartial record of events which takes in to account the evidence provided by all parties .
",
10870,0,," by removing scope for denialism , a peace can be constructed on the foundations of an impartial truth .
",
10871,0,," many of the actions of israel have been controversial , the guardian says it is the issue that is most controversial and comes under most scrutiny , such an impartial historical record would be particularly useful for a full understanding of atrocities committed by all sides .
",
10872,0,," by prosecuting perpetrators , justice creates a deterrent .
",
10873,0,," the deterrent effect , as accepted in criminal law generally , is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future -- it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again .
",
10874,0,," if those who committed atrocities ` get away with it ' they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence .
",
10875,0,," if sharon was prosecuted for his crimes in the 50s , would he have gone on to have the same political career ?
",
10876,0,," he would likely not have had the chance to allow the sabra and shatia massacre or operation defensive shield .
",
10877,0,," the career of laurent nkunda is a good example of this ; he fought in the tutsi group that took control of rwanda inending the genocide and then was a rebel commander in both congolese civil wars in which he was accused of atrocities before launching his own rebellion , only now afteryears as an army commander is he under arrest .
",
10878,0,," clearly nkunda being locked up at some stage would have been better than regularly negotiating with him to try and create peace .
",
10879,1,,"onjuly 1998, the rome statute establishing the international criminal court was signed.
",
10880,1,," pursuant to several decades of drafting and negotiation, the conference at rome settled the creation of a court with jurisdiction over the most heinous crimes ; namely, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression.
",
10881,1,," the icc builds on the precedent of the ad hoc tribunals established by un security council resolutions in the 1990s.
",
10882,1,," the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty) and the international criminal tribunal for rwanda (ictr) are currently investigating and prosecuting those responsible for commission of some of the most grave violations of human rights in the twentieth century.
",
10883,1,," the establishment of the permanent and standing institution of the icc at the hague removed this complex process of negotiation; the difficulty of obtaining security council assent; and the perennial problem of securing funding.
",
10884,1,,"the objections raised, by the us specifically, concern the potential for political prosecution, the excessive jurisdiction, and the capacity for crippling costs to any state, whether already a signatory or a current opponent.
",
10885,0,," however, the proponents of the court maintain it is necessary to ensure war criminals are brought to justice and, in so doing, offer justice to their victims.law-abiding states like the united states that have yet to ratify the icc should have nothing to fear if they behave lawfully .
",
10886,0,," the prosecutor of the icc is only concerned with the most grave offences and it defies belief that the us would approve a strategy of genocide or systematic mass violations of human rights that could attract the jurisdiction of the icc .
",
10887,0,," further , the discretion of the prosecutor is not unchecked .
",
10888,0,," the statute requires that the approval of three judges sitting in a pre-trial chamber be obtained before an arrest warrant can be issued or proceedings initiated .
",
10889,0,," moreover , there is no harm to the interests of the us in being subjected to a mere preliminary investigation .
",
10890,0,," in fact , it is preferable that spurious accusations are briefly examined and shown to be baseless , than that these accusations be allowed to raise doubts about the credibility of a state 's actions and the impartiality of the tribunal in question .
",
10891,0,," the us acceptance of the jurisdiction of the prosecutor of the icty is evident ; the us troops forming part of the kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo could equally be subject to investigation and prosecution by the icty .
",
10892,0,," the us is prepared for its forces to operate under the scrutiny of the icty since it reasonably does not expect its members to commit the very crimes they are deployed to prevent .
",
10893,0,," the icc offers a multilateral means by which international law can be brought to bear on the perpetrators of war crimes .
",
10894,0,," as amnesty international argues , ` the icc ensures that those who commit serious human rights violations are held accountable .
",
10895,0,," justice helps promote lasting peace , enables victims to rebuild their lives and sends a strong message that perpetrators of serious international crimes will not go unpunished ' .
",
10896,0,," furthermore , and for the first time , the icc has the power to order a criminal to pay reparations to a victim who has suffered as a result of their crimes .
",
10897,0,," such reparations may include restitution , indemnification and rehabilitation .
",
10898,0,," judges are able to order such reparations whether the victims have been able to apply for them or not .
",
10899,0,," though reparations will often not be sufficient on their own for lasting peace , they are a step in the right direction and only made possible by the establishment of the icc .
",
10900,0,," upon signing the rome statute in, u.n. secretary general kofi annan stated that ` the establishment of the court is still a gift of hope to future generations , and a giant step forward in the march towards universal human rights and the rule of law '.
",
10901,0,," such statements demonstrate the impact the court could potentially have , as a body that simultaneously cherishes sovereignty and protects national courts whilst offering a means by which criminals in states unable or unwilling to prosecute will still be brought to justice .
",
10902,0,," as the natural and permanent heir to the process started at nuremberg in the wake of world war ii2 , the icc ensures that the reach of law is now universal ; war criminals , either in national or international courts , will be forced to trial as a result of the principle of universal jurisdiction1 .
",
10903,0,," the deterrent effect of such a court is obvious and a warning to those who felt they were operating in anarchic legal environments .
",
10904,1,,"anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were introduced in the uk by the crime and disorder actand have been available in england and wales since april 1999.
",
10905,1,," they were ‘reinforced’ by the anti-social behaviour act 2003.
",
10906,1,," theact defines anti-social behaviour as behaviour that ""caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household.""
",
10907,1,," they stop people from doing stated things or going to stated places.
",
10908,1,," they last for a minimum of two years, but can last longer.
",
10909,1,," those given asbos can be ‘named and shamed’ in local media, and sometimes are.
",
10910,1,," orders have been granted for abusive behaviour, vandalism, flyposting, and harassment as well as more the more celebrated exotic problems such as elderly people incessantly playing gramophones.
",
10911,1,,"whilst asbos are civil orders and are made out according to the civil standard of ‘balance of probabilities’, criminal penalties may be incurred by their breach.
",
10912,1,,"  their existence therefore arguably blurs the lines that exist between the civil and criminal law.
",
10913,1,,"the conservative-liberal democrat coalition government in the uk announced in februarythat it wants to replace asbos with several different schemes such as criminal behaviour orders, banning individuals from certain activities, crime prevention injunctions, place specific orders preventing anti-social behaviour in that particular place, and police ‘direction’ powers, where the police will be able to direct individuals away from a place.
",
10914,1,,"the law for replacing asbos is contained in the anti-social behaviour, crime and policing bill.
",
10915,1,," a particular cause of controversy has been the first clause, which defines “anti-social behaviour” as something which may annoy someone, which has been criticized as unduly broad.
",
10916,1,," these replacements would be known as ipnas (injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance).
",
10917,0,," asbos address the symptom , not the condition .
",
10918,0,," their powers are wide and undefined -- too wide , meaning that judges and magistrates can do pretty much whatever they like .
",
10919,0,," certainly there are problems in the way people conduct themselves -- but if such behaviour is n't criminal , then it 's up to families and communities to fix it .
",
10920,0,," the asbo is the latest example of excessive state interference in the lives of citizens .
",
10921,0,," either conduct is criminal , or it is not .
",
10922,0,," the law of nuisance exists .
",
10923,0,," restraining orders exist .
",
10924,0,," asbos are n't intended to deal with that kind of problem : they 're the tool of the state controlling behaviour .
",
10925,0,," just because a problem exists , does n't mean it 's the job of the state to try and fix it .
",
10926,0,," the powers granted to the state in its efforts are disproportionate to the problems concerned .
",
10927,0,," indeed , the current trend is against such interference both as shown by the potential replacement of asbos and by court decisions such as one that people should not be punished for hurling obscenities .
",
10928,0,," asbos are explicitly intended to deal with bad juvenile behaviour .
",
10929,0,," but they encourage rather than deal with such problems .
",
10930,0,," they are viewed as badges of honour that boosts street credibility amongst young gangs -- the ` naming and shaming ' just increases this .
",
10931,0,," they push people that could be helped by social work or proper attention into an unenviable category of ` offender ' -- they criminalise people for behaviour that is n't criminal .
",
10932,0,," `` a youth recently appeared in court in manchester for breach of his asbo .
",
10933,0,," the order had been made in the youth 's absence without his being able to give his side of the story , one of the main concerns about asbos and one that can lead to misuse .
",
10934,0,," the day after the order was made someone came to his house to `` serve '' it on him .
",
10935,0,," this consisted of his being handed a copy of what was a fairly bulky document running to several dozen pages with no attempt to explain it or even to ascertain if he was literate enough to read it .
",
10936,0,," the order included an restriction preventing him entering a particular estate nearby and another preventing him from associating with certain others .
",
10937,0,," unfortunately , he went out before reading the order and beached it twice that day .
",
10938,0,," the next day he went out again and breached it three times by mistake as he had not read the part covering the particular restriction .
",
10939,0,," he now faces possibly custody although he has never been convicted of a criminal offence . ''
",
10940,0,," the issuing of asbos is inconsistent and almost amounts to a geographical lottery .
",
10941,0,," people can be jailed for breaching an asbo where the original offence was itself non-imprisonable -- i.e, a civil procedure is being used to create and expand criminal sanctions .
",
10942,0,," asbos have also been imposed on people with mental health problems where treatment would have been more appropriate .
",
10943,0,," newspapers are full of examples of absurd asbos .
",
10944,0,," they make an ass of the law and show that the nanny state is overreaching .
",
10945,0,," people trying to kill themselves really are n't going to be put off by the prospect of breaching their asbo .
",
10946,0,," other examples include a prostitute who was prohibited from carrying condoms in an area that included her drug clinic , a prohibition on mobile soup vans that fed the homeless and a deaf girl who was banned from spitting in public .
",
10947,1,,"truth and reconciliation commissions use the principles of restorative justice and alternative dispute resolution to help post conflict states recover from pasts characterised by politically motivated crimes and human rights abuses.
",
10948,1,,"the best known contemporary example of this process is the truth and reconciliation commission that operated in south africa betweenand 1998.
",
10949,1,," under the chairmanship of archbishop desmond tutu, individuals involved in the violence surround the apartheid regime were invited to confess what they had done.
",
10950,1,," the commission addressed violent acts, human rights violations and politically motivated crimes committed by individuals on both sides of the conflict between the south african state and the liberation movement.
",
10951,1,," surviving victims and the relatives of dead victims were also given an opportunity to tell their story.
",
10952,1,," those who told what they did under apartheid were granted freedom from prosecution for their crimes (providing the commission agreed that they were politically motivated); those who refused to testify remain liable to criminal prosecution.
",
10953,1,,"although south africa is the best known example of such a commission, others preceded it, particularly in post-dictatorship situations in latin america (e.g. argentina, bolivia, chile, guatemala, el salvador) and africa (e.g. nigeria, ghana).
",
10954,1,," in many of these cases the commission's main task was truth-finding, but national reconciliation was usually at least part of the motivation behind setting them up.
",
10955,0,,"  countries emerging from violent pasts , involving repression , civil war and political violence may attempt to come to terms with their histories in three ways .
",
10956,0,," firstly , they can attempt to ignore the past , allowing those guilty of atrocities to go unpunished and perhaps even prosper under the new system .
",
10957,0,," this approach leaves victims ' families bitter and communities divided , entrenching resentments and potentially distorted accounts of individuals ' involvement in violent activities .
",
10958,0,," such a situation makes renewed violence all the more likely .
",
10959,0,," secondly , post conflict states can set up war crimes courts , as in the balkans , rwanda and sierra leone , but these may be seen as victor 's justice , or as an imposition by a distant opaque international body .
",
10960,0,," those threatened by such courts may refuse to lay down their arms , jeopardising any chance of a lasting peace settlement - as with joseph kony 's long-running rebellion in northern uganda .
",
10961,0,," finally and often best , they can set up a form of truth and reconciliation commission .
",
10962,0,," this requires the whole country to face up to its past , to acknowledge that violence was done by all parties and that the victims were many , and to seek reconciliation through forgiveness at both personal and national levels .
",
10963,1,,"assassination can be defined as the targeted killing of an individual for political reasons in peacetime.
",
10964,1,," it can be undertaken by individual citizens, or by the agents of another state, but in either case it takes place without any legal process.
",
10965,1,," assassinating a dictator is often considered in the context of hitler and stalin, or of secret cia action against foreign leaders such as fidel castro in the cold war period (after this became public knowledge in the mid-1970s us presidents have banned the use of assassination by executive order).
",
10966,1,," however, this issue regained topicality in the 1990s as leaders such as saddam hussein and slobodan milosevic pursued bloody careers which threatened international peace.
",
10967,1,," in recent years us airstrikes apparently aimed at killing muammar qaddafi of libya (1986), osama bin laden (1998) and saddam hussein (1991 and 2003) have provoked argument - were these assassination attempts or did these leaders have the status of enemy combatants in a time of war?
",
10968,1,," certainly the un charter (article 24) and various conventions (e.g new york convention) clearly appear to make assassination in peacetime against international law.
",
10969,0,," proponents nevertheless argue that assassinations are necessary for the greater good of preventing civilian suffering.
",
10970,0,,"the utilitarian justification for assassination lies in the many deaths and much suffering potentially prevented if just one man or woman is killed .
",
10971,0,," the greater good demands a single evil act is done , especially if it would avert the immediate and certain danger of much worse evil .
",
10972,0,," oppressive , tyrannical dictators who sustain their own power through fear have no legitimacy .
",
10973,0,," who now would n't wish that hitler had been killed in?
",
10974,0,," or pol pot in?
",
10975,0,," the casualties directly inflicted as a result of their misguided policies could have been avoided .
",
10976,0,," as a last resort therefore , assassination stands as a ` permissible means to a just end ', handing the reins of the state back to its oppressed population .
",
10977,0,," armed invasions are costly events , in terms of the lives lost , the emotional trauma and the ever-widening hole created in the economy .
",
10978,0,," assassination provides a means to accomplish the goals of a military campaign without having to put boots on the ground , removing the predominant obstacle to democratic reform or energy security .
",
10979,0,," as angelo codevilla argues , ` the military art consists of striking those people and things most likely to stop the enemy from continuing the war '.
",
10980,0,," as the gulf war demonstrated , often the quarrel is not with a state but its leader and it would be ` futile and immoral to demolish a country in the hope that this will persuade the tyrant to give way '.
",
10981,0,," furthermore , ari fleischer , a spokesman in the bush administration when asked about the cost of a possible war with iraq , remarked ` the cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than the cost of war ... the cost of one bullet , if the iraqi people take it on themselves , is substantially less than that '.
",
10982,0,," this admission belies the bush administration 's belief that hussein 's assassination would allow them to accomplish their objectives without a prolonged ground campaign .

",
10987,0,," their tendency to attack other countries in order to divert attention from their unpopular actions at home means that assassination is justified as a means of preventing a terrible war , which might rapidly become a regional or global conflict .
",
10988,0,," a study by benjamin jones and benjamin olken inconcluded that ` assassinations of autocrats produce substantial changes in the country 's institutions '.
",
10989,0,," if a tyrant comes to power by illegitimate , undemocratic means and directly suppresses , harms , and kills the citizens of a state , that tyrant loses all legitimacy to the continued occupation of office .
",
10990,0,," if it is impossible to depose the leader by more subtle means of opposition and democratic voting , the only route to freedom may be assassination .
",
10991,0,," in such cases , assassination is certainly justifiable , provided that as dietrich bonhoeffer points out , there exists a ` group capable of quickly occupying , or remaining in , the key organs of the totalitarian dictatorship '.
",
10992,0,," the assassination of libyan dictator muammar gaddafi would undoubtedly lead to the installation of a democratic regime with the full backing of the libyan people , yet his fierce , paternal grip on the army prevents this from occurring .
",
10993,1,,"intellectual property (ip) is a legal field that refers to creations of the mind such as musical, literary, and artistic works; inventions; and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related rights.
",
10994,1,," under intellectual property law, the holder of one of these abstract ""properties"" has certain exclusive rights to the creative work, commercial symbol, or invention by which it is covered, such as a limited monopoly on the sale of inventions and products of creative endeavour.
",
10995,1,," the idea of intellectual property is relatively new, the term itself was not used until the 19th century and the legal principles only date back to the british statute of anne inand statute of monopolies from 1623.
",
10996,1,," different countries have different systems of intellectual property rights so there is often conflict between countries with one countries property rights not being respected by another.
",
10997,1,," there has been some standardization through the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (trips) agreement that established minimum levels of protection for all world trade organization members.
",
10998,1,," the main question for the  issue of intellectual property hinges around whether it increases innovation and good business practice, as its defenders maintain, or whether it stifles these things by instituting unjust monopoly powers for the holders of intellectual property rights.
",
10999,0,," however a broader issue of contention revolves around whether intellectual property is indeed a form of property, even though it is intangible in nature, or whether it is simply an invention and not a real form of property at all.
",
11000,0,,"the state incurs huge costs in monitoring for intellectual property right infringement , in arresting suspected perpetrators , in imprisonment of those found guilty , even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that , once released to it , belonged to the public domain .
",
11001,0,," the united states government , for example , projects costs of investigating intellectual property claims will cost $million betweenand.
",
11002,0,," firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecuting offenders , all of which generates huge costs and little or no return2 .
",
11003,0,," furthermore , the deterrent effect to intellectual property piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal .
",
11004,0,," this is because in many cases intellectual property rights are next to unenforceable , as the music and movie industries have learned in recent years .
",
11005,0,," only a tiny handful of perpetrators are ever caught , and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it does little to stop it .
",
11006,0,," intellectual property , in many cases , simply does not work in practice ; firms should move with the times and recognize they need to innovate in ways that will compensate .
",
11007,0,," an individual 's idea , so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden , belongs to him .
",
11008,0,," when he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public , it becomes part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it .
",
11009,0,," if individuals or firms want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product .
",
11010,0,," one should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has , since no such ownership right exists1 .
",
11011,0,," no one can own an idea .
",
11012,0,," thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products .
",
11013,0,," physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards .
",
11014,0,," ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once spoken , enters the public domain and belongs to everyone .

",
11020,1,," file sharing outside of the control of the copyright holder has become a major problem for media companies who blame it for lost revenues as their content is illegally copied and shared over the internet reducing the demand for the legal product.
",
11021,1,," ‘graduated response’, sometimes also called ‘three strikes’, is a policy copyright holders are calling for to combat online copyright infringement.
",
11022,1,," graduated response means that copyright holders would use automated technical means to monitor the activities of internet users, for example via surveillance of forums and blogs, posing as file sharers in peer-to-peer networks or via an automatic copyright filter applied to internet traffic (‘fingerprinting’ of ‘watermarking’).
",
11023,1,," if a copyright infringement is detected, the copyright holder will collect the internet protocol address (ip-address, the address your internet service provider uses to identify your computer) and then report the infringer’s ip-address to its internet service provider (isp).
",
11024,1,," the isp will then warn the owner of the ip-address.
",
11025,1,," after they have been warned a certain number of times, the isp can terminate or suspend the subscriber’s internet connection, or send a fine for copyright infringement.
",
11026,1,,"this casefile focusses on the specific policy of graduated response, and only minimally deals with the larger ethical/legal question whether downloading copyrighted content from an unauthorized source should be considered illegal.
",
11027,0,," copyrighted material is intellectual property : someone worked hard for it to produce it .
",
11028,0,," downloading this content without paying the proper rights holder for it amounts to theft .
",
11029,0,," furthermore , downloading copyrighted material from an unauthorized source creates an impossible market for producers of copyrighted content , because they have to ` compete with free ' .
",
11030,0,," why would the average consumer want to pay for a download from an authorized website , when she can get the same movie from a pirate-site for free ?
",
11031,0,," to build a commercially viable content industry online , we need to protect this industry from the unfair competition of the parallel market .
",
11032,0,," research has shown that consumers are likely to stop downloading from unauthorized sources when warned by their isp .
",
11033,0,," for example : seven out of ten ,% , uk music consumers would stop illegally downloading if told to do so by their isp , andper cent of consumers would stop illegally file-sharing after two warnings from their isp .
",
11034,0,," this shows that the threat of a possible disconnection together with a friendly warning is enough to stop most consumers from downloading from illegal source .
",
11035,0,," the reasoning behind it is simple : consumers can now download without a cost , a graduated response mechanism first raises awareness scaring off those who are only casually downloading out of convenience and then heightens the expected cost of infringement and thus makes it more likely consumers will use legal sources .

",
11039,0,," secondly , the consumer has ample time to change his or her behaviour : a consumer can insist on infringing copyright at least two times before the sanction takes place .
",

",
11041,1,,"at least as far back as ben johnson's steroid scandal at theolympics, the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports had entered the public psyche.
",
11042,1,," johnson's world record sprint, his win, and then, the stripping of his gold medal made news around the world.
",
11043,1,," however, performance-enhancing drugs in sports do not begin with johnson.
",
11044,1,,"  a quick overview of drugs in sports reveals the earlier use of questionable substances; some even argue that drugs in sports date back to the earliest olympic games.
",
11045,1,,"an alarming number of sports today, baseball, football, track and field, and especially cycling, have been shaken by doping scandals in recent years.
",
11046,1,," several olympic champions were stripped of their medals as a result of positive drugs tests.
",
11047,1,," although attention is often focused upon athletics, almost all sports have a “drug problem” and devote considerable energy to testing competitors regularly, banning those who fail them.
",
11048,1,," an anonymous survey conducted by the u.s. anti-doping agency revealed that about one tenth of all athletes admit to having used drugs, even though illegal (2).
",
11049,1,," nonetheless, doubts remain as to the effectiveness of these tests and the fairness of some of the resulting bans, and some argue the whole approach is deeply flawed.performance-enhancing drugs include steroids (the male hormone testosterone), human-growth hormone (hgh), recombinant erythropoietin (r-epo), an artificial hormone and other drugs taken to build muscle-bulk during training, and stimulants or blood-doping taken to improve performance in competition.
",
11050,1,," authorities tend to deal with this problem in different ways, for example, for the tour de france cycling competition all sportsmen were deemed suspicious and ranked on a list fromto(1), others impose random tests on athletes.
",
11051,1,," the market for performance enhancing drugs, such as epo (erythropoietin) is big, inalone, epo--generated more than $5 billion for inventor amgen (2).
",
11052,1,," question is what is the appropriate measure to deal with performance enhancing drugs – is there a way to control them and is there any sense in controlling them at all.
",
11053,1,,"most such drugs have some medical uses and are prescribed legally in certain non-athletic contexts; it is unlikely that a proposition would also wish to legalize “recreational” drugs such as cocaine, heroin and amphetamines, although all of these could be regarded as performance-enhancing in certain sporting contexts.
",
11054,0,," freedom of choice : if athletes wish to take drugs in search of improved performances , let them do so .
",
11055,0,," they harm nobody but themselves and should be treated as adults , capable of making rational decisions upon the basis of widely-available information .
",
11056,0,," even if there are adverse health effects in the long-term , this is also true of tobacco , alcohol and boxing , which remain legal .
",
11057,0,," we allow world class athletes to train forhours a week , on average , adjust their diets and endanger themselves by pushing the boundaries of their body .
",
11058,0,," we let them do it , because it is what they chose which is best for them .
",
11059,0,," according to the nfl player association the average life expectancy of an nfl player isyears of age  .
",
11060,0,," thus already we allow athletes to endanger their lives , give them the choice of a lifestyle .
",
11061,0,," why not also extend this moral precedent to drugs ?
",
11062,0,," the natural/unnatural distinction is untenable .
",
11063,0,," already athletes use all sorts of dietary supplements , exercises , equipment , clothing , training regimes , medical treatments , etc. to enhance their performance .
",
11064,0,," there is nothing ` natural ' about taking vitamin pills , wearing whole-body lycra suits , having surgery on ligaments , spending every day in a gym pumping weights or running in shoes with spikes on the bottom .
",
11065,0,," diet , medicine , technology , and even just coaching already give an artificial advantage to those athletes who can afford the best of all these aids .
",
11066,0,," since there is no clear way to distinguish from legitimate and illegitimate artificial aids to performance , they should all be allowed .
",
11067,0,," so taking these drugs is no more unnatural than what happens today .
",
11068,0,," a practical example of an unnatural aid is the speedo worn inat the beijing olympics .
",
11069,0,," fina , the world governing body of swimming was concerned about the extraordinary statistics in beijing where swimmers wearing the speedo lzr racer swimsuit wonper cent of all available medals and brokeworld records .
",
11070,0,," since speedo launched the suit in,world records have fallen , until february.
",
11071,0,," the use of performance enhancing drugs is based on advances in science .
",
11072,0,," when new drugs and therapies are found , athletes turn to them and as a result are much of the time ahead of the anti-doping organizations , which need to develop methods of athlete testing whenever a new drug that is meant to be untraceable is created .
",
11073,0,," init was a big shock when riccardo ricco , a cyclist , was caught using the performance-enhancing drug mircera , which had been considered undetectable for a number of years .
",
11074,0,," the fact is that a ban of performance enhancing drugs enables mainly athletes from wealthy countries and teams that can afford the newest technology to go undetected , whilst others are disadvantaged  .
",
11075,0,," so because it gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy one who can pay for the undetectable drugs , we should legalize it .
",
11076,0,," it does not take a lot for chemists to produce performance enhancing drugs , the scientific american reports : `` rogue scientists start with testosterone or its commercially available analogues and then make minor structural modifications to yield similarly active derivatives . ''
",
11077,0,," the underground chemists make no effort to test their creations for effectiveness or safety , of course .
",
11078,0,," production of a simple new steroid compound would require `` lab equipment costing maybe $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 , '' .
",
11079,0,," depending on the number of chemical reactions needed for synthesis , `` some of them could be made in a week or two .
",
11080,0,," others might take six months to a year . ''
",
11081,0,,"  as a result of legalizing performance-enhancing drugs a backstreet industry can become regulated as a result there will be much more control and testing to ensure the health and safety of the athletes who take the drugs .
",
11082,1,,"crafted in response to rising crime rates and high rates of recidivism, mandatory sentencing laws targeting repeat offenders began to appear during the early 1990s.
",
11083,1,," in order to ensure that serious offenders were sentenced to longer periods of time, these statutes severely limited the degree of latitude which judges were allowed to exercise in sentencing.
",
11084,1,,"perhaps the most controversial such policy was adopted by the state of california in 1994.
",
11085,1,," that year’s propositionintroduced what has become known as the “three-strikes” rule.
",
11086,1,," intended to target habitual offenders, propmandates that any offender who is found guilty of a third felony after being convicted of two separate serious or violent felonies must receive a minimum sentence of 25-years-to-life.
",
11087,1,,"though half the states and the federal government have enacted their own versions of “three-strikes” for repeat offenders, the legitimacy of three-strikes laws remains an open question.
",
11088,1,," crime rates have declined to historic lows in california, but academics disagree over the degree to which three-strikes is responsible for the decrease in serious crime.
",
11089,1,,"  in addition, the constitutionality of three-strikes laws were challenged in thesupreme court case ewing v. california, though eventually upheld in a narrow 5-4 decision.
",
11090,0,," with incarceration rates on the rise and state budgets tightening each year, these statutes remain a pressing concern both as a matter of principle and of practicality.
",
11091,0,,"mandatory sentencing laws prevent judges from taking into consideration aggravating and mitigating circumstances when imposing punishment .
",
11092,0,," this is because by nature , fixed penalties must ignore whether mandatory sentences have `` beneficial or deleterious effects on the victims and on the family and associates of the defendant ''.
",
11093,0,," at times , this results in greater injury to society than a more lenient alternative .
",
11094,0,," instead sentencing should be much more flexible to take into account all the different circumstances of a case and the nature of the crime .

",

",
11098,0,," those inmates who have received lighter sentences are , furthermore , less likely to receive access to proper rehabilitative programs , to such an extent that `` studies have demonstrated a correlation between overcrowding and increased recidivism . ''
",

",
11100,0,," pritikinthree strikes laws mandate that courts impose upon offenders a lengthy minimum sentence upon conviction of a third offense .
",
11101,0,," in california , the first two strikes must be considered serious or violent , but the mandatory minimum sentence of 25-years may be imposed upon conviction of any third felony offense .
",
11102,0,," in ewing v. california  , a four-time felon received the mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction of stealing three golf clubs with a combined total value of less than $ 1,200 .
",
11103,0,," regardless of how severe a view one takes of recidivism , such a punishment is clearly excessive and grossly disproportionate to the current offense .
",
11104,0,," allowing mandatory minimum sentences to be applied in cases like this undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system .
",
11105,1,,"especially since the end of world war ii, there have been calls for a global system of justice and an effort to prevent massive atrocities from occurring.
",
11106,1,," tribunals to prosecute crimes committed in yugoslavia and rwanda brought up the question of whether a permanent court would be beneficial.
",
11107,1,," the international criminal court (icc) was born out of these efforts to recognize an international court on july 1,with the founding of the rome statute to prosecute crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.
",
11108,1,," the rome statute states that the court also has jurisdiction over crimes of aggression, but lacks a definition of what constitutes those crimes and thus will only have the ability to prosecute them when there is an amendment passed.
",
11109,1,," the icc differs from the international court of justice (icj) in that the icj tries legal disputes between countries; the icc is specific to individuals.
",
11110,1,," the icc is a permanent court that will try individuals if either a) the security council refers a case to the court, or b) if the state on whose territory the crime was committed/the state of the accused's nationality has ratified the rome statute.
",
11111,1,," thus, the icc relies on the cooperation of member states to find and apprehend criminals.
",
11112,1,," the security council's role in the court was a contentious issue during the conference held to draft the rome statute and remains one of the issues with the court today; currently, the security council can either refer cases or delay them formonths an unlimited number of times.
",
11113,1,," the icc prosecutor may investigate cases based upon information from reliable sources other than the security council such as non-governmental organizations, victims, etc.1currently,countries have ratified the rome statute and anotherhave signed but not ratified the treaty.
",
11114,1,," proponents argue that the icc is a necessary step to fight heinous crimes and institute justice while deterring crime in an increasingly globalized world.
",
11115,1,," other nations who oppose the icc, such as the united states, china, and russia cite issues of sovereignty and abuse.
",
11116,1,," possible alternatives to the icc include individual tribunals and reconciliation programs.

",
11140,0,," in today 's world , crimes are no longer confined to single nations and affect the world due to the effects of globalization .
",
11141,0,," an international court is necessary as a global solution to problems that often involve multiple actors ; a permanent international court accounts for all parties involved .1 for example the lord 's resistance army has been mostly active in uganda but has often hidden from the ugandan military by crossing into southern sudan or the democratic republic of congo .
",
11142,0,," because it is not limited to a specific territory , the icc has truly global jurisdiction and therefore is most appropriate given the recent rise of international crimes .
",
11143,0,," joining the icc would also encourage nations to recognize that crimes are no longer confined to specific borders and that the notion of territoriality provides a dangerously limited view of the scope of crimes today ; ratifying the rome statute would force nations to recognize that domestic and international law inevitably interact .2 the domestic-foreign distinction has allowed states to ignore or commit certain atrocities in the name of national interest .
",
11144,0,," there is a growing global consensus that crimes against humanity need to be punished , as demonstrated by the tribunals to address the crimes of yugoslavia and rwanda .
",
11145,0,," the question is no longer whether we should set up an international court but rather how to best do it , and the icc gives the international community a framework within which to work to establish a strong courts .1 rejection of the icc has become a symbol of rejection of international norms , and countries that have refused to ratify the rome statute in the name of national interest , such as the united states , have been seen as imperialist , isolationist , and against global efforts to tackle important issues .

",
11153,1,,"in an age of technology, more and more information can be gathered from an individual for security measures, for example for fingerprint or iris checks at airport security.
",
11154,1,," while the intention of this may be to increase security across nations, some people have begun to question how much of their personal information is really needed by government organisations, and whether their liberty is as risk.
",
11155,1,," while the standards of identity cards may vary from country to country, nations such as the uk, canada, the usa, france and australia have all debated implementing a system of biometric identity cards.
",
11156,1,," in this case, each citizen would have a card with their personalised data, such as a fingerprint.
",
11157,1,," however, this information may be expanded to include other information such as medical records, and use of identity cards may ‘function creep’ to an extent where it may eventually double as identification for an individual’s bank account or car ownership, or even as a passport.
",
11158,1,," the technology is constantly growing and may some day incorporate many other aspects of ordinary, everyday life if this motion were to be implemented.
",
11159,1,," it is fair to assume that, under the motion, an individual would be required to produce their identity card whenever requested by a figure of authority; for example a policeman or welfare officer.
",
11160,1,," while it is possible for the proposition to frame the debate around a standard identification card which does not necessarily feature biometric information, this is already status quo in countries such as belgium, germany and portugal.
",
11161,1,," arguably these examples could form a policy for the proposition side to propose.
",
11162,1,," however, given that many people already carry a form of basic identification with their name on – such as a driver’s license or credit card – the debate would perhaps be broader, and bring more interesting points of discussion, if the proposition’s mechanism featured biometric identity cards.
",
11163,1,," these are the source of much topical discussion and invoke arguments over privacy of information, the use and safety of biometric information by the government, and the true benefit to the cardholder.
",
11164,0,," identity cards could prove a key instrument to combat crime , terrorism and fraud .
",
11165,0,," given that terrorists have used fake passports to cross borders in the past , a sophisticated identity card , possibly containing specific biometric information which can not be easily faked , could be crucial in preventing terrorist acts in the future .
",
11166,0,," in cases where the police were suspicious , they could rapidly check the identities of many people near a crime scene , which would make their investigation much swifter and more effective .
",
11167,0,," the cbi also believes that ` the creation of a single source of identity data ' in the form of biometric identity cards would also decrease identity fraud .
",
11168,0,," given that identity fraud currently costs the uk # 2.7 billion per year , canada overmillion canadian dollars per year , and in america identity fraud relating to credit cards alone costs around $ 8.6 billion per year , this is obviously a serious problem under the status quo .
",
11169,0,," these crimes would be much more difficult if biometric data was required for financial transactions and other activities such as leaving or entering a country ; identity cards are the best way forwards .
",
11170,0,," the value of id cards in combating terrorism and crime is much reduced if not everyone has them as the guilty would be less likely to want to get such cards unless they could somehow fake them .
",
11171,0,," the average person is faced with numerous requisitions for identification every day , whether trying to access their own bank account , prove their age or prove their address .
",
11172,0,," the identity card could easily incorporate all of this information to become one convenient for of identification and save the user the hassle of carrying so many documents around with them .
",
11173,0,," given that ` the average person now has to remember five passwords , five pin numbers , two number plates , three security id numbers and three bank account numbers just to get through everyday life ' , there is evidently a need for a single , concise form of identification .
",
11174,0,," moreover , it would help them to identify the people they have to interact with .
",
11175,0,," there have been numerous cases of criminals posing as company officials such as gas workers in order to gain access to somebody 's home and steal from them .
",
11176,0,," these identity cards would particularly help vulnerable citizens who are the most at risk of this kind of injustice .
",
11177,0,," for this reason these cards should be compulsory , they would not be much use as identification if not everyone had one that could be checked by anybody .
",
11178,0,," illegal immigration is an enormous problem in western nations .
",
11179,0,," the uk estimates that there are more that one million illegal immigrants living in britain , likely around 2.2 million .
",
11180,0,," for america , this number could be as high asmillion .
",
11181,0,," identity cards would mean that , even if illegal immigrants did succeed in crossing the border , they would most likely be found out because they could not pass routine security checks required on an everyday basis because they would not have been issued an identity card .
",
11182,0,," given that illegal immigration is frequently linked to international crime such as trafficking , this is clearly a problem which we need to address in a new way .
",
11183,0,," as biometric identity cards would be able to store medical data , they could be instrumental in saving somebody 's life .
",
11184,0,," for example , if somebody suddenly suffered an epileptic fit , it would be much faster for medical staff to find out their illness and medical history no matter where there medical records are held as everyone 's records would be linked to their id card , allowing them to be treated faster and more efficiently .
",
11185,0,," it would also be easier to contact a friend or relative if they knew the last place where they had used their identity card , allowing faster unity of family in a medical emergency .
",
11186,0,," law-abiding citizens who have not and do not intend to commit any crimes should not have a problem with this motion .
",
11187,0,," carrying a single card is not a huge burden to an individual .
",
11188,0,," rather they can reap the benefits of convenience to them personally , alongside the added security benefit to their whole nation which will help to keep them safe .
",
11189,0,," as it is to be issued to everyone there will not even be the inconvenience of having to spend a long time applying for the card as it is in the government 's interest to make it as simple as possible with mobile offices taking the relevant biometrics where the people live so as to have the least impact on individual 's lives as possible .
",
11190,1,,"many countries restrict the right of those sentenced to imprisonment to vote in elections.
",
11191,1,," for example, convicted prisoners are automatically banned from voting in armenia, bulgaria, the czech republic, estonia, hungary, luxemburg, romania, russia and the united kingdom.
",
11192,1,," in australia, prisoners are only entitled to vote if they are serving a sentence of less than three years.
",
11193,1,," eighteen european states, including spain, the netherlands and the republic of ireland, place no formal prohibition on prisoners voting.
",
11194,1,," in practice, however, it is often difficult for prisoners in some of these countries to vote: in the republic of ireland, prisoners have the right to be registered to vote in their home constituency, but have no right to either a postal vote or to be released to cast a vote at a ballot box.
",
11195,1,,"the issue is particularly controversial in the united kingdom and the usa.
",
11196,1,," in april 2001, the british high court rejected a case brought by john hirst (a man serving a life sentence for manslaughter), who argued that the ban on prisoners voting was incompatible with the human rights act 1998.
",
11197,1,," in march 2004, the european court of human rights ruled that the british government was in breach of the european convention on human rights; the european court's grand chamber rejected the british government's appeal in october 2005.
",
11198,1,," proponents argue this is proof that the right to vote is an unalienable right that cannot be taken from a prisoner, regardless of the severity of his crime.
",
11199,1,," opponents maintain that disenfranchisement is a suitable punishment for those who have proven unable to adhere to society's laws and will act as a deterrent against re-offending.
",
11200,1,," as a result, in the united states, one in forty americans of voting age are ineligible to vote because they are, or have been, in prison.
",
11201,1,," the arguments below relate directly to whether those currently serving prison sentences should be allowed to vote.
",
11202,1,,"the use of children (for the purposes of this article, anyone younger than eighteen years-of-age) in warfare has been a continuous feature of all human conflicts, but declined rapidly in europe in the first half of the twentieth century.
",
11203,1,," the intensive development of the laws and customs of war that took place between the first world war and the collapse of the ussr placed an increasing emphasis on the role of supranational bodies and treaties in regulating the conduct of states in armed disputes and protecting the rights of civilians caught up in war zones.
",
11204,1,,"in 1998, following the creation of ad hoc tribunals designed to investigate and punish the perpetrators of war crimes in the former yugoslavia and rwanda, the rome statute created the international criminal court.
",
11205,1,," sincethe icc has had jurisdiction over events occurring in the territory of parties to the statute, or over situations referred to it by the united nations security council.
",
11206,1,," the icc was intended to be complementary to the domestic law of states party to the treaty, investigating war crimes in circumstances where a state’s judiciary is unable to do so itself.
",
11207,1,," the use of children in combat roles in armed conflict is prohibited by article 8.2.26 of the rome statute - ""conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into the national armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities"" is defined as a war crime.
",
11208,1,,"although many post-colonial states may be signatories to the rome statute, they often govern highly plural societies that contain diverse forms of cultural and social grouping.
",
11209,1,," indeed, the representativeness of such governments, and the extent to which “fourth world” communities within the borders of established nations are consulted about participation in international institutions, is often a contentious issue within post-colonial states.
",
11210,1,," in many of these communities, military participation by boys as young as twelve is considered a necessary measure for the protection of isolated settlements and an important marker of a boy’s passage into manhood.
",
11211,0,," the issues underlying all debates on child soldiers go to the very heart of intercultural justice , politics and governance .
",
11212,0,," international and supranational legislation notwithstanding , the notion that children should be protected from all forms of violence at any cost is expressly western .
",
11213,0,," western notions of inviolate childhood , free of worry and violence , are merely a cultural construct .
",
11214,0,," this construct can not be duplicated in societies beset by forms of privation and conflict that have been alien to western liberal democracies for the last seventy years .
",
11215,0,," attempting to enforce this construct as law - and as a form of law that can trump domestic legislation - endangers vulnerable communities , inhibits the creation of democratic norms and can even criminalise the children it claims to protect .
",
11216,0,," laws are , ultimately , social norms that are taught , enforced and arbitrated on by the state .
",
11217,0,," the value of these norms is such that they are deemed to be a vital part of a society 's identity and the state is entrusted with their protection .
",
11218,0,," however , this ideal can be difficult to achieve .
",
11219,0,," debate as to which norms the state should be custodian of is constant .
",
11220,0,," where there is a disconnect between a law and the daily lives , aspirations and struggles of a society , it becomes unlikely that that law will be complied with .
",
11221,0,," generally , a state will not be able to give a pronouncement the force of law if it does not reflect the values held by a majority of a society .
",
11222,0,," what if the state that is intended to mount the `` piecemeal intervention '' of banning the use of child soldiers is weak , corrupt or non-existent ?
",
11223,0,," what if a state can not carry out structured interventions of the type described above ?
",
11224,0,," norms that state that the conscription of children is acceptable - due to tradition or need - will be dominant .
",
11225,0,," in order for the juristic principles underlying the authority of the icc to function properly , it is necessary for there to be a degree of certainty and accessibility underlying laws promulgated by a state .
",
11226,0,," while ignorance of the law is not a defence before the icc , it impossible to call a system of law fair or just that is not overseen by a stable or accepted government .
",
11227,0,," this is not possible if a state is so corrupt that it does not command the trust of its people ; if a state is so poor that it can not afford to operate an open , reliable and transparent court and advocacy system ; if territory with a state 's borders is occupied by an armed aggressor .
",
11228,0,," western notions of rule-of-law are almost impossible to enforce under such conditions .
",
11229,0,," all of these are scenarios encountered frequently in africa , and central and southern asia .
",
11230,0,," some regions within developing nations are so isolated from the influence of the state , or so heavily contested in internecine conflicts , that communities living within them can not be expected to know that the state nominally responsible for them has signed the convention of the rights of the child or the rome statute .
",
11231,0,," nor can the state attempt to inform them of this fact .
",
11232,0,," laws still exist and are enforced within such communities , but these are not state-made forms of law .
",
11233,0,," child soldiers and their commanders are simply obeying the strongest , the most effective and the most stable source of law in their immediate environment .
",
11234,0,," what is harmful to this process of recovery is the branding of child soldiers as war criminals .
",
11235,0,," the stigma attached to such a conviction would condemn hundreds of former child soldiers to suffering extended beyond the end of armed conflicts .
",
11236,0,," sentencing guidelines binding on the icc state that anyone convicted of war crimes who is younger than eighteen should not be subject to a sentence of life imprisonment .
",
11237,0,," their treatment , once incarcerated , is required to be oriented toward rehabilitation .
",
11238,0,," the jurisdiction of the icc is primarily exercised according to culturally constructed assumptions about the way war works -- that there will be a clear division between aggressors and defenders , that armies will be organised according to chains of command , the civilians will not be targeted and will be evacuated from conflict zones .
",
11239,0,," but countless conflicts in africa and central asia have proven these assumptions to be flawed .
",
11240,0,," it should not be forgotten that almost all formulations of this motion define cultural relativism only as a defence to the use of child soldiers .
",
11241,0,," it will still be open for icc prosecutors to prove that the use of child soldiers has been systematic , pernicious and deliberate , rather than the product of uncertainty , necessity and unstable legal norms .
",
11242,0,," moreover , not all defences are `` complete '' defences ; they do not all result in acquittal , and are often used by judges to mitigate the harshness of certain sentences .
",
11243,0,," it can be argued that it was never intended for the icc to enforce laws relating to child soldiers against other children or leaders of vulnerable communities who acted under the duress of circumstances .
",
11244,0,," at the very least , those responsible for arming children in these circumstances should face a more lenient sentence than a better-resourced state body that used child soldiers as a matter of policy .
",
11245,0,," due to the nature of conflicts in developing nations , where the geographic influence of `` recognised '' governments is limited , and multiple local law-making bodies may contribute to an armed struggle , it is difficult for the international community to directly oversee combat itself .
",
11246,0,," united nations troops are often underfunded , unmotivated and poorly trained , being sourced primarily from the same continent as the belligerent parties in a conflict .
",
11247,0,," when peacekeepers are deployed from western nations , their rules of engagement have previously prevented robust protection of civilian populations .
",
11248,0,," ironically , this is partly the result of concerns that western states might be accused of indulging in neo-colonialism .
",
11249,0,," it is outrageous for the international community to dictate standards of war-time conduct to communities and states unable to enforce them , while withholding the assistance and expertise that might allow them to do so .
",
11250,0,," therefore , the icc , as a specialist legal and investigative body , should be encouraged to use the expertise it has accumulated to distinguish between child military participation driven by a desire to terrorise populations or quickly reinforce armies , and child military participation that has arisen as a survival strategy .
",
11251,1,,"hate speech is a controversial issue in all western liberal democracies (wlds).
",
11252,1,," what makes hate speech on university campuses a unique topic is the combination of public space, the historical role of universities as centres of free speech and expression, and the age and impressionability of students.
",
11253,1,,"the definition of what constitutes hate speech is also controversial.
",
11254,1,," for the purposes of the debate, proposition should set out a clear definition of hate speech as being the wilful promotion of hatred towards a group based on non-immutable personal characteristics.
",
11255,1,," an immutable person characteristic includes a person’s race, gender, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation.
",
11256,1,,"as far as a model goes, there are currently at leastamerican universities with campus speech codes (fire, “spotlight on speech codes”).
",
11257,1,," these codes are written by the school and so vary greatly from campus to campus.
",
11258,0,," however, for this round it should be sufficient to argue that schools should have (or should be mandated to have) speech codes with meaningful enforcement mechanisms like expulsion and/or bans from entering the campus.
",
11259,0,,"hate speech poses a clear danger to students and other members of the campus community .
",
11260,0,," often , the hatred is directed towards minority groups that are easily identifiable based on skin colour , clothing , or behaviour .
",
11261,0,," because these minorities are easy to identify , they can be targeted by those swayed by the speaker 's message .
",
11262,0,," every hate crime is a tragedy and an attack against the principles of wlds .
",
11263,0,," even when the message does n't provoke violence , it can have a deep emotional harm on members of the targeted community .
",
11264,0,," as such , the government has a duty to intervene to ensure that individuals are safe .
",
11265,0,," while hate speech is a form of expression , it is not one that encourages dialogue .
",
11266,0,," by promoting hatred based on immutable personal characteristics it is by definition anti-dialogue .
",
11267,0,," hate speech does not contribute anything ; it merely provides a justification for violence and discrimination .
",
11268,0,," extreme messages , be they in words or through symbols , deter moderates from voicing their opinions , either because they do not want to legitimize the message or out of fear of reprisals .
",
11269,0,," this reduces the net dialogue on university campuses and injures the quality of the dialogue that remains .
",
11270,0,," members of groups that find themselves the targets of hate speech will be less likely to attend universities where they feel targeted .
",
11271,0,," as a result , those campuses will become less diverse which will decrease the most effective deterrent of hateful ideas : understanding through interaction .
",
11272,0,," less muslim , gay , jewish , etc. students on campus is exactly what those promoting hatred are trying to achieve .
",
11273,0,," less students of the targeted group makes them easier to target because there are less people speaking out against the hate speech .
",
11274,0,," a downward spiral is created that , if not checked , can drastically reduce campus diversity which is a massive harm to social integration and social harmony .
",
11275,0,," speech codes or other censorship sends a signal to minorities that they are welcome in the university .
",
11276,0,," when individuals feel that they will be targeted at a university based on who they are , they are less likely to attend that university either out of fear they will be discriminated against or because they believe that they will not be allowed to express themselves freely without being discriminated against or assaulted .
",
11277,0,," no group should be discouraged from attaining higher education because of immutable personal characteristics .
",
11278,0,," tertiary education is at the heart of social mobility and self-actualization .
",
11279,0,," even if no attack ever takes place , because hate speech can create an atmosphere which deters members of society from attending university the state is justified in banning it .
",
11280,1,,"at present police can remove samples of dna from individuals suspected of involvement in a specified crime, commonly by the removal of cells from the mouth using a cheek swab.
",
11281,1,," the dna of the suspect can then be compared to any genetic material found at the scene of the crime; the dna of each individual does not change during his lifetime.
",
11282,1,," this technique is commonly used in police investigations and is termed 'dna fingerprinting'.
",
11283,1,," the creation of a database of dna would allow police to use dna in order to search for a suspect, rather than merely to provide evidence once a suspect has been apprehended.
",
11284,1,," the british police have operated a database of the dna of convicted criminals since- controversially, however, this includes dna samples from all those arrested for a crime, even if they were later acquitted.
",
11285,1,," as a result, the uk database now records of 4.5 million people on it; it has also recently been the subject of an adverse european court of human rights judgement.
",
11286,1,," proponents of a dna database argue that it would lead to more convictions and act as a deterrent, whilst opponents maintain that state knowledge of such sensitive information is a step too far and an affront to civil liberties.
",
11287,1,,"the broadcasting of trials may be through tv or across the web.
",
11288,1,," currently, icc trials are web streamed on their website with aminute delay.
",
11289,1,," this feed is also used by television broadcasters and used for reporting.
",
11290,1,,"  probably the most infamous televised criminal trial was that of oj simpson in california in the mid-1990s.
",
11291,1,," simpson, heisman trophy winning running back and later actor, was tried for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend.
",
11292,1,," the trial, which resulted in a not guilty verdict, was broadcast live.
",
11293,1,,"a more recent source of debate in the united kingdom was channel 4’s non-live broadcast of the retrial of nat fraser for the murder of his wife, arlene.
",
11294,1,," theminute long programme showed footage of the six week trial, which occurred the prior year, in addition to interviews with people involved.
",
11295,1,," this came after three years of negotiation, and was the second british murder trial filmed, the first in its entirety.
",
11296,1,," while in england and wales all filming and photography in criminal courts is prohibited, the law in scotland (which, while part of the united kingdom maintains its own legal system) is less strict, allowing filming if everyone involves consents to do so.
",
11297,1,," in the united kingdom some civil appeal cases are broadcast, such as some of those at the united kingdom supreme court, are already broadcast live online, and filming criminal sentencing is being considered.
",
11298,1,," civil law systems, in general, do not use juries (one of the factors that makes it harder to film trials due to the risk of them being identified) so there is less controversy surrounding the broadcast of trials in countries that use civil law.
",
11299,0,," broadcasting trials would be likely to turn the court in to entertainment .
",
11300,0,," the simpson trial showed how harmful a televised high profile trial can be degenerating into a freak show .
",
11301,0,," the icc trials are among the most high profile in the world so are likely to be susceptible to this .
",
11302,0,," much of the interest in the scsl charles taylor trial came along when naomi campbell gave evidence so giving the trial celebrity interest that had little to do with the legalities involved .
",
11303,0,," jurisdictions where cameras are not permitted in courts still can and do have accurate , informative and timely reports of cases , however high profile , without filming them .
",
11304,0,," courtroom sketches , written transcripts and other tools allow reportage without the use of original footage in a tawdry manner .
",
11305,0,," televising criminal trials may cause a number of problems with witnesses .
",
11306,0,," it may make individuals less likely to give evidence , make them more likely to play to the television audience , or make the already intimidating process of giving evidence in court more so .
",
11307,0,," also , television broadcasts make it more likely that the identities of anonymized witnesses would leak out -- something that has already happened at the icc in the ruto-sang case .
",
11308,0,," the icc already has problems with witnesses , including allegations of bribing and intimidating prosecution witnesses in the ruto case , which has led to walter barasa , a kenyan journalist , being subject to an arrest warrant .
",
11309,0,," ending the televising of trials may go some way to remedy those problems .
",
11310,0,," televising the trial can create extra incentives for defendants to attempt to disrupt the process .
",
11311,0,," during his trial , saddam hussein regularly made outbursts and went on political rants -- based on iraqi law , he was able to examine witnesses after his lawyer .
",
11312,0,," this was not new -- slobodan milosevic tried various antics in front of the , televised , icty , and ratko mladic used those tactics post-hussein .
",
11313,0,," milosevic 's approval ratings grew , and he even won a seat in the serbian parliament while on trial .
",
11314,0,," a televised trial creates more of a risk of a political hijacking of the trial -- something that has been shown to be a successful tactic by milosevic .
",
11315,0,," this both potentially damages the successor government by giving those on trial a platform and the court itself .
",
11316,1,,"traditionally, heads of states, and other state officials, have enjoyed some form of immunity from prosecution.
",
11317,1,," immunity can be divided up in to two types – functional immunity, which is immunity for official actions, and personal immunity, which is attached to the individual.
",
11318,1,," head of state immunity typically falls under functional immunity.
",
11319,1,," personal immunity typically applies to individuals such as diplomats (diplomatic immunity is outlined in the vienna convention on diplomatic relations).
",
11320,1,," this is focused on both of these forms of immunity when applied to political figures.
",
11321,1,,"in 2002, the international court of justice, a un body entirely unrelated to the international criminal court, confirmed the existence of state immunity as a part of customary international law, in a case concerning a belgian arrest warrant for the dr congolese foreign minister, who was alleged to have incited genocide, which was issued under a belgian universal jurisdiction law that allowed the belgian courts to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, even if they are outside belgium.
",
11322,1,,"the issue was put to the test regarding the situation of the later life of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet.
",
11323,1,," following the ousting of democratically elected president salvador allende in a military coup pinochet lead a military junta that, during hisyear cia backed rule, committed a significant number of large scale human rights abuses.
",
11324,1,,"  due to immunity that was created by the succeeding chilean government, he was not prosecuted there; however he was indicted in spain under universal jurisdiction inwhile he was in the united kingdom for medical treatment.
",
11325,1,,"the issue of head of state immunity lead to a battle over the possibility of his extradition in the british courts, going to its highest  court three times – first on the issue of whether he was immune from prosecution in spain, secondly on an issue of bias (one of the original judges, leonard hoffmann, had failed to  disclose that he was an unpaid director of the charitable wing of amnesty international), and a third, on the same issue as the first, after the unprecedented setting aside of the initial decision.
",
11326,1,," eventually, the appellate committee of the house of lords (a de facto court, rather than an arm of the legislature, since fully spun off in to the supreme court of the united kingdom) ruled that he did not have head of state immunity for some, but not all, of the charges, and allowed the home secretary to authorize his extradition.
",
11327,1,," the original decision in pinochet i was that torture cannot be a state function, negating functional head of state immunity.
",
11328,1,," the decision in the third case was that he was not immune due to the torture convention, rather than anything in customary international law.
",
11329,1,," eventually pinochet’s extradition was vetoed by home secretary jack straw, he returned to chile, where he was indicted, but died before he could be tried.
",
11330,1,,"international tribunals have typically rejected all forms of head of state immunity, rome statute articlemakes “official capacity” irrelevant in the work of the icc, following on from similar positions in the icty and ictr.
",
11331,1,," these courts have repeatedly made determinations that state immunity does not apply at international tribunals, most recently done so by the special court for sierra leone, in the case of charles taylor.
",
11332,1,,"the issue of the trial of serving heads of state has resurfaced following the indictment of uhuru kenyatta, current president of kenya, for his alleged role in violence after theelection.
",
11333,1,," kenyatta, who was elected after the indictment, is still operating as president of kenya (a fellow defendant in a separate trial, william ruto, is deputy president).
",
11334,1,," this issue has been made more complex due to the shooting by al-shabab linked gunmen at the westgate shopping centre, with kenyatta having to lead the response to the attacks while preparing to defend himself at the hague.
",
11335,1,," kenyatta’s trial is, at the time of writing, due to start on the 12th of november 2013, but he will not need to be present for all of the trial.
",
11336,0,," international diplomacy involves visits by both diplomats and government figures to other states .
",
11337,0,," this can even include states where relations are tense or even hostile .
",
11338,0,," india and pakistan , who have a very tense relationship and share one of the most fortified borders in the world , the line of control that divides kashmir , have embassies in each other .
",
11339,0,," even throughout the cold war , the usa and soviet union had a full and normal diplomatic relations .
",
11340,0,," just as diplomatic immunity prevents politically motivated arrests of diplomats , head of state immunity is necessary to `` grease the wheels '' of international diplomacy to allow international summits to take place without campaigns for the arrest and trial before domestic courts of foreign politicians .
",
11341,0,," if a head of state were to be arrested for trial before a foreign domestic court , it would cause immense damage to diplomatic relations between those two countries , russia recently got into a row over the arrest of one of its diplomats in the netherlands .
",
11342,0,," the diplomat was quickly released but russia still demanded the ` guilty parties ' be punished .
",
11343,0,," the reaction to the arrest of a head of state or government would be much greater and would likely mean the breaking of diplomatic ties .
",
11344,0,," leaders would be much less willing to visit the country where the arrest occurred in the future for fear it would happen to them and would damage the world diplomatic system by challenging the idea of diplomatic immunity .
",
11345,0,," heads of state and senior politicians are targets for political stunts .
",
11346,0,," this could be seeking to get a political opponent locked up so as to benefit from the removal of an opponent .
",
11347,0,," alternatively it may be as part of a publicity stunt to highlight their own issue of concern or organisation .
",
11348,0,," in both cases the trial does not need to convict as the figure being in a trial will be enough to damage them and provide publicity .
",
11349,0,," in, following a request by supporters of palestine , an arrest warrant was sought at westminster magistrates ' court for the arrest of tzipi livni , who was foreign minister of israel during israel 's 2008-2009 invasion of the gaza strip , also known as operation cast lead .
",
11350,0,," at the time of the attempted arrest livni was no longer in office but the action was clearly a stunt .
",
11351,0,," livni was not arrested in the end , because she cancelled her trip to the uk , and the warrant was dropped by the director of public prosecutions , kier starmer .
",
11352,0,," however , a needless diplomatic incident was still caused .
",
11353,0,," sometimes people will do bad things in order to achieve good and necessary results .
",
11354,0,," for example , the allied bombing campaigns in the second world war would be highly likely to amount to a war crime under the rome statute if they were done today .
",
11355,0,," they were indiscriminate , they targeted civilians , and additionally even at the time were recognised as having little military value .
",
11356,0,," instead the idea was to terrorise the civilian population .
",
11357,0,," yet they were considered to be necessary as showing the allies were doing something to aid the soviet union .
",
11358,0,," the same might be the case with the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki , they clearly targeted civilians , yet if they helped end the war without a ground invasion of japan then this war crime might have been for the greater good .
",
11359,0,," head of state immunity allows individuals to take unpopular and difficult decisions that are necessary for a greater good in government without fear of prosecution for their actions .
",
11360,0,," we need our leaders to be able to take decisions based on the national interest , not based upon their concern for their life after office .
",
11361,1,,"for the summer of 2013, the question of security versus privacy was debated and discussed all around the world, due to the leaks about intelligence agencies surveillance systems provided by edward snowden to newspapers such as the guardian.
",
11362,1,," snowden was a nsa whistleblower who revealed that the national security agency was conducting a massive campaign through which it was using telephones, the internet and other technologies to engage in spying, monitoring and tracking the actions of foreigners, and through other intelligence agencies such as gchq u.s. citizens, often without any warrant and often oversight systems were seen to be failing or ignored.
",
11363,1,," this showed the world that the intelligence services have the capability of secretly monitoring a large part of the population without anyone having a single clue.
",
11364,1,," in this debate, many proponents argue that the right to privacy is inalienable and that we must protect ourselves from an otherwise abusive government, while on the other side it is claimed that it is security which should be prioritized and that this kind of measure will lead to lives being saved and criminals behind bars.
",
11365,1,," at the moment, in most of western states, the police must have a warrant in order to track someone’s phone, car or internet action, but this may not or may not be the case for other surveillance as carried out by intelligence agencies.
",
11366,0,," one of the most important pillars on which every single western liberal democracy has been founded is freedom .
",
11367,0,," allowing the government to be able to track and monitor individuals through mobile or internet connections is against everything we , as a western society , stand for .
",
11368,0,," first of all , it is undisputable that liberty and freedom are indispensable to our society .
",
11369,0,," every single individual should and must be the master of his own life , he should have the capacity of controlling how much the government or other individuals know about him , the right to private life being the main argument in this dispute .
",
11370,0,," secondly , it is clear that phone and internet tracking potentially allow the government to know almost everything about you .
",
11371,0,," most phones have a gps incorporated and a lot can be deduced about ones habits by the photos or updates on his social network profile .
",
11372,0,," one who knows all of another 's travels , can deduce whether he is a weekly church goer , a heavy drinker , a regular at the gym , an unfaithful husband , an outpatient receiving medical treatment , an associate of particular individuals or political groups , basically about every activity you have in your life .
",
11373,0,," remember this data is extremely precise , as your cell phone sends your location back to cell phone towers every seven seconds -- whether you are using your phone or not -- potentially giving the authorities a virtual map of where you are 24/7 .
",
11374,0,," finally , we , as individuals , created this artificial structure , i.e the state , to protect our human rights , but also to protect us from each other .
",
11375,0,," we admitted that some rights can be taken away if there is serious concern about the security of other people .
",
11376,0,," therefore , it is absolutely normal to allow the government to track and follow certain individuals who are believed to have taken part in criminal activities , but there is no ground on which you can violate the right to privacy of a law-abiding citizen , especially if we are talking about such an intrusive policy .
",
11377,0,," if we did so , it would come as a direct contradiction with the very purpose the state was created .
",
11378,0,," in the light of the recent nsa events  , we must try and see past this curtain of fog the government has put in front of us , trying to make us believe that everything it does , it does for our own good and that in this process the law is being respected to the letter .
",
11379,0,," unfortunately , if the necessary system of checks-and-balances between the government and the masses or judicial courts is lacking , it will always find ways to abuse its powers and violate our rights .
",
11380,0,," even with the warrant currently being mandatory when trying to tap one 's phone , we see that justice department 's warrantless spying increasedpercent in decade  .
",
11381,0,," if the government is currently invading our lives when we have specific laws banning it from doing so , why should we believe that this phenomenon wo n't escalate if we scrap those laws ?
",
11382,0,," the government 's biggest limitation when actively trying to spy or follow a large group of people was technological ; it was difficult - if not impossible - to follow a lot of people for days at a time .
",
11383,0,," but with surveillance tools it 's becoming cheaper and easier , as is proven by the astounding 1.3 million demands for user cell phone data in the last year `` seeking text messages , caller locations and other information '' ,.
",
11384,0,," , without the resource limitations that used to discourage the government from tracking you without good reason , the limits on when and how geolocation data can be accessed are unclear .
",
11385,0,," a police department , for example , might not have the resources to follow everyone who lives within a city block for a month , but without clear rules for electronic tracking there is nothing to stop it from requesting every resident 's cell phone location history .
",
11386,0,," considering these facts , it is clear that , as we live in a time when it would be extremely easy for the government to engage in mass surveillance of the population , we must enforce and harden the current laws for our own protection , rather than abandoning then for good .
",
11387,0,," no matter what , george orwell 's books should not be perceived as a model for shaping our society .
",
11388,0,," at the end of the day , without any oversight , it would be extremely easy for the government to abuse this power given to it by electronic surveillance tools , without us ever knowing it .
",
11389,0,," this system is the only thing left that prevents government agencies to violate our rights .
",
11390,0,," in a world where state agencies would have the possibility of tracking everyone 's moves without any person knowing it , we would reach a point in which the population lose their trust in their elected officials .
",
11391,0,," the consequences could then be very damaging to democracy .
",
11392,0,," this phenomenon took place right after the nsa leaks , as the confidence in the us government was near record 's low .
",
11393,0,,"  first of all , the population would know that the government is spying and tracking their moves , but they would n't know how much .
",
11394,0,," this general lack of information on this matter will create a lot of scepticism relating this process , and inevitably the population will reach the conclusion that the government is conducting massive phone tapping and spying campaigns as no one is checking on them .
",
11395,0,," despite potential official document trying to give certain facts regarding this , due to the previous incidents when the state has been releasing little or misleading information , these will have little influence over the population .
",
11396,0,," as a result , trust in the state will suffer a massive blow .
",
11397,0,," this is extremely problematic , as you want and need the general population to trust and listen to what the government , and more particularly law enforcement agencies , say in a lot of instances .
",
11398,0,," when promoting non-discrimination , gender equality or increased social welfare contributions for the poor , you need the population to see the state as someone who is on the same side with them and someone who they can trust .
",
11399,0,," unfortunately , the scepticism with which those beneficial government proposals will be received will drastically reduce their impact and the chances of them being implemented .
",
11400,0,," if i do not trust that the government is looking after my own good , but rather in a lot of instances its interests are mutually exclusive with mine , then i would most probably lose my respect towards authority .
",
11401,0,," when talking about law enforcement agencies , i.e the police , the nsa , etc. , it is clear that we have trusted them to protect us and our rights .
",
11402,0,," when it is those very agencies that are conducting these warrantless spying campaigns , it comes as a direct contradiction with their very purpose and thus the impact and the loss of trust is higher on this level .
",
11403,0,," moreover , in the long term , the whole electoral process could suffer a lot from this lack of confidence , as individuals are n't particularly inclined to go to elections any more if they see that no matter what they do , their rights will still be breached .
",
11404,0,," as you need the population to trust the government , so that its reforms are being met with positivism and not reluctance , you must not portray the government as an intrusive , harmful and ill-willing element of the society .
",
11405,0,," surveillance changes the way we make daily decisions -- the same way that a rapidly approaching police car in your rear-view mirror may make you feel nervous even when you are driving completely lawfully .
",
11406,0,," the very existence of a mass surveillance system will negatively influence the behaviour and emotions of a significant majority of the population .
",
11407,0,," first , surveillance affects emotions and mental performance , as it leads to heightened levels of stress , fatigue and anxiety due to the constant feeling that you are being watched .
",
11408,0,,"  secondly , it creates conformity to social norms .
",
11409,0,," `` in a series of classic experiments during the 1950s , psychologist solomon asch showed that conformity is so powerful that individuals will follow the crowd even when the crowd is obviously wrong .
",
11410,0,," a government that engages in mass surveillance can not claim to value innovation , critical thinking , or originality . ''
",
11411,0,,"  this is of extreme importance as first of all , it is the state 's duty to create the most peaceful and harmonious environment in which the individual can reach its full potential , this one clearly not being it , and second if we do n't feel free to do things that are perfectly legal because we think someone might think it suspicious or out of character then it is difficult to say we are really free .
",
11412,1,,"the icc does not have its own police force.
",
11413,1,," currently, in order for the icc to be able to bring defendants to trial, it needs to enlist the assistance of member states in order to bring defendants in to trial.
",
11414,1,," in theory, this should be automatic.
",
11415,1,,"however, in practice this is not the case.
",
11416,1,," in addition to the failure to capture joseph kony and other lra leaders in the uganda situation, sudanese president omar al-bashir travelled to an african union event in nigeria, a state party to the icc, but the nigerian authorities claimed that they could not arrest him due to provisions in the au treaties.
",
11417,1,,"an icc enforcement arm could take on a large number of forms, and its proponents have not formed a consensus around any one of them.
",
11418,1,," it could be on various sizes, be based in one location or out of several.
",
11419,1,," one area that would need to be established is if it were to be based on the complementarity principle that is used for making decisions to prosecute – the icc will not get involved unless the state is unable or unwilling to take action.
",
11420,1,,"what exactly would an enforcement arm for the icc look like?
",
11421,1,," there have in the past been suggestions that there should be a united nations rapid reaction force capable of intervening in crisis situations of cases of state collapse, in the 1990s the un secretary general kofi annan decided against any attempt to create a un standing army, but wished to increase the rapidity of response using un members.
",
11422,1,," what an enforcement arm for the icc means then could be anything from such a standing army down to a small force made up of experts that supports national militaries with training and technology based on the model of the multinational police forces set up in bosnia in the late 1990s.
",
11423,1,,"in this instance we intend to take a middle course between the extremes of a light training force and a full scale army.
",
11424,1,," an icc enforcement arm would potentially be quite heavily armed as it may need to fight armed non-governmental groups but it would not have the capabilities to engage even the smallest states.
",
11425,1,," it would not therefore be able to snatch a war criminal who is being specifically sheltered by a state.
",
11426,1,," the mandate of the force would be to intervene either if asked to help internally by a national government or authorised by a united nations security council resolution which would to a certain extent enable the pursuit of a war criminal across borders.
",
11427,0,," the remit of the icc is unlike the remit of any national court .
",
11428,0,," it deals exclusively in crimes so unacceptable there is an international consensus behind their illegality and the need for prosecutions .
",
11429,0,," the parties that signed up to the rome statute 's reason for the creation of the icc was `` that such grave crimes threaten the peace , security and well-being of the world '' the perpetrators of such crimes clearly need to be brought to book , and to do that they need to be apprehended .
",
11430,0,," the same agreement said the signatories were `` resolved to guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement of international justice '' if this is the case then there should be agreement on enabling that enforcement by creating an icc enforcement arm .
",
11431,0,," again the rome statute makes clear that the agreement `` shall not be taken as authorizing '' intervention by another state .
",
11432,0,," this is why the enforcement needs to be done by a separate international force who could not be considered a threat to any state .
",
11433,0,," quite simply there is little point in international criminal justice if there is no force to bring the criminals to the court .
",
11434,0,," if international criminals are to be caught it needs to be clear that there is an organisation with the responsibility and authority to catch them .
",
11435,0,," this is especially important when the criminal in question is able to slip across borders to avoid the national authorities in one state as joseph kony has done as the icc would be able to cross borders itself and coordinate the response from multiple countries .
",
11436,0,," the importance of an organisation that is able to catch international criminals can be highlighted by the experience of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia where despite a memorandum of understanding relating to the detention of war criminals in bosnia nato denied it had the power to make arrests so leading to patrols actively avoiding wanted men to avoid a situation in which they might have to engage in arrests.
",
11437,0,,"a lack of clarity over whether an organisation can enforce its warrants for arrest results in arrests not being made .
",
11438,0,," ultimately the icty was successful because this situation was resolved with the creation of multinational police forces backed up with traditional nato military power if necessary leading to the arrest ofindividuals .
",
11439,0,," eight out of the thirty people indicted by the icc , four in the darfur situation , including omar al-bashir , three lord 's resistance army leaders in uganda and one in the dr congo investigation , are still alive and avoiding justice .
",
11440,0,," an in-house enforcement arm would be more effective at capturing indictees than many of the forces of the state parties , as it is likely to be more competent than many of the under-resourced or under-trained national forces .
",
11441,0,," an in house force would be solely focused on capturing the wanted war criminals so would both be focusing resources and much less likely to be sidetracked by other priorities , many of which may be influenced by politics , than national forces .
",
11442,0,," one of the suggested solutions to the failure to capture joseph kony and leaders of the lra is to have greater involvement of peacekeepers ; an icc force would provide the same kind of help .
",
11443,0,," to its critics , the icc is an organization that can be mocked with stalin 's dismissal of the influence of the pope : `` how many divisions does he have ? ''
",
11444,0,," an icc capable of arresting its own fugitives would become a more credible organization , not only due to the show of competence through the arrests -- it would lead to more trials , and more convictions , that would help contribute to the acceptance of the icc as a serious court that is effective at bringing international criminals to justice .
",
11445,0,," a legal institution needs to be effective to remain credible .
",
11446,0,," this would make countries much more likely to cooperate because the icc would be doing more to help them by providing some of the necessary resources .
",
11447,0,," henry kissinger apparently said `` who do i call if i want to speak to europe ? ''
",
11448,0,," , he is not sure he said it , because there is no single european leader , and if the us wants political or military cooperation it calls the uk or france .
",
11449,0,," in much the same way if countries need help apprehending and convicting someone they are much more likely to call in the icc if it can actually help them catch the wanted person .
",
11450,1,,"the united states has not ratified the rome statute, the treaty that underpins the international criminal court.
",
11451,1,," while the icc does not have jurisdiction over actions in us territory, it does have jurisdiction where americans are on the territory of a state that has ratified the rome statute, or if the situation is referred by the un security council – referral of a case against the us being unlikely due to their permanent member veto.
",
11452,1,,"for this reason, the united states has sought for other nations to enter in to articleagreements, also known as bilateral immunity agreements, which declare that that state party will not send an american to the icc for trial.
",
11453,1,,"the legal basis for these agreements is an interpretation of article 98(2) of the rome statute, which states that the icc “may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested state to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending state is required to surrender a person of that state to the court, unless the court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending state for the giving of consent for the surrender”.
",
11454,1,," the primary intent behind article 98(2) has been argued to be to protect those subject to status of forces agreements, causing some to doubt the validity of articleagreements.
",
11455,1,,"  the us has taken a position insisting on icc state parties, other than nato members, “major non-nato allies” and taiwan, signing agreements using article 98(2) to shield americans from icc prosecution as a condition for some forms of military and developmental aid, under some circumstances.
",
11456,1,,"european countries that have entered into articleagreements with the united states include albania, bosnia-herzegovina, georgia, macedonia, montenegro and romania (which was signed before their accession to the european union, who oppose articleagreements and consider them illegal - the others are not eu member states).
",
11457,1,," albania and romania are members of nato, the rest are not, but may join in the future.
",
11458,1,,"should these states terminate their articleagreements with the united states, or continue with them?
",
11459,0,," the european states have signed and ratified the icc statute and should honour it , to do otherwise makes a mockery of the icc which those states supported throughout its genesis and at least claim to continue to support .
",
11460,0,," article was only intended to be a factor where there are other agreements such as status of forces agreements , an agreement entered in to between two states , one having military forces in the other voluntarily , such as british troops in germany .
",
11461,0,," it was not meant as a broad-brush way for states being able to grant selective immunity to citizens of non-member states who have committed genocide or crimes against humanity inside the jurisdiction of an icc member state .
",
11462,0,," signing an articleagreement is at best accepting foreign instigation of the abuse of process of a treaty .
",
11463,0,," at worst it is accepting an illegal attempt at circumventing the treaty .
",
11464,0,," the bilateral immunity agreements that these states have entered in to undermine the court that these states have signed up to .
",
11465,0,," bias invalidate the intention for the icc that any person who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court , which only triggers when an individual is a citizen of a state that has ratified the rome statute , or in the territory of a rome statute state , and commits the horrific acts covered by the rome statute should be brought to trial by providing a get out clause for the powerful .
",
11466,0,," a proliferation in bias could potentially render the icc a court that can only try nationals of small states that do not have the leverage to get others to agree to bias , already the icc is accused of bias in putting africans on trial and ignoring the rest of the world , such agreements make this worse .
",
11467,0,," bias by one state , the united states , creates a precedent for other states to use and as they do so the field that is available for international criminal justice will become smaller and smaller .
",
11468,0,," the united states has been accused of using bullying tactics in the pursuit of gaining articleagreements by , amongst others , human rights watch .
",
11469,0,," this has included significant reductions in non-military , development aid , including to countries such as south africa , the bahamas and peru , as well as making threats to accession to nato in the case of croatia .
",
11470,0,," by signing up to articleagreements , european nations help contribute to a climate where smaller nations can also be strong-armed in to harming the international criminal court by signing them , even if they were not subject to blackmailed in to it themselves .
",
11471,1,,"the geneva conventions ofcollectively form a core part of international humanitarian law, a series of conventions and protocols that regulate armed conflict.
",
11472,1,," the geneva conventions specifically detail a number of protections which states must extend to enemy combatants from the opposing country captured during times of war.
",
11473,1,," these include prohibitions against all forms of violence including torture, humiliating and degrading treatment, and the passing of sentence without a properly constituted court hearing.
",
11474,1,," in addition, medical treatment must be provided to those who need it and prisoners must be allowed to send and receive letters, enabling continued contact with their families.
",
11475,1,," however, these protections only apply to soldiers of recognised armies.
",
11476,1,," the global “war on terror” has pitted america and its allies against al-qaeda, the taliban, and other non-state groups adopting irregular warfare strategies.
",
11477,1,," when captured, their members (or suspected members) wear uniform and represent no sovereign state, posing problems for those holding them.
",
11478,1,," the controversial treatment of terror suspects when captured by the west in other parts of the world has been repeatedly highlighted by international media organisations and human rights groups.
",
11479,1,," guantanamo bay is a particularly disturbing example, but it is undoubtedly reflective of the way that terrorists are treated in other, less visible parts of the world.
",
11480,1,," proponents of subjecting terrorists to the geneva conventions argue that ostensible changes in warfare must give way to the greater need to maintain the regulations on warfare that have restricted its barbarity over the past half-century.
",
11481,0,," opponents maintain that this is neither desirable nor achievable, and that new methods are required to combat the new threat.
",
11482,0,,"terrorists are engaged in a war like any other : they unite as a political actor to undertake military action in favour of a specific cause .
",
11483,0,," the fact that they do not represent one individual nation and that they are not at war with a specific list of states does not undermine this : al qaeda , for example , has clear goals including eliminating american influence within muslim nations , destroying israel and re-establishing the caliphate , blanchard  .
",
11484,0,," the fact that we may not view these causes as worthy or legitimate is irrelevant : we do not assess the merits or legitimacy of a conflict between states before deciding whether to apply the geneva convention .
",
11485,0,," it should therefore apply equally to soldiers and terrorists .
",
11486,0,," the geneva conventions were formed to ensure that future wars would not result in the barbarity and wanton violence that mired world war ii ; to deny it to terrorists would risk the undermining of norms that have developed to restrain warfare .
",
11487,0,," if we do n't treat terrorists as prisoners of war therefore , we risk a return to the barbarity of warfare in the first half of the 20th century .
",
11488,0,," even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity .
",
11489,0,," there are certain acts , such as torture , to which no individual should be subjected , regardless of their own behaviour .
",
11490,0,," the geneva convention is about universal respect for human dignity , international committee of the red cross  , not merely for those who show it in return .
",
11491,0,," civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner , regardless of the barbarity of their adversaries .
",
11492,0,," only by acting in such a manner can states prove the superiority of their own humanity .
",
11493,0,," poor treatment affirms terrorist ideology : regardless of what is morally right , it would be beneficial to treat terrorists in the ways prescribed by the convention .
",
11494,0,," terrorist ideology is often predicated on the behaviour of those countries against which it is targeted .
",
11495,0,," treating captured terrorists or terror suspects in a way that ignores their human dignity only reinforces negative perceptions of the west and encourages the radicalization of the youth , mccarthy  .
",
11496,0,," in addition , such behaviour can be used to justify terrorist actions to less radicalised members of certain communities .
",
11497,0,," harsh interrogation of captives has not been shown to be effective , white  .
",
11498,0,," those who are prepared to die to advance their cause are unlikely to yield information , no matter how much they are threatened or tortured .
",
11499,0,," where captives do provide information , they often state simply what they think that the interrogators want to hear , rather than anything that is true , mazzetti  .
",
11500,0,," in addition , given the cellular nature of many terrorist organisations , those captured often have very little useful information to begin with .
",
11501,0,," even if they have been involved in a plot , they may only have information about a very small part of that plot .
",
11502,0,," furthermore , winning the trust of prisoners can lead to more effective information than the use of torture .
",
11503,0,," the united nations , as the institution that formed and maintains the geneva conventions and other restrictions on warfare , is able to use its structures to punish states that do not adhere to its protocols .
",
11504,0,," the international criminal court , established by the rome statute of, is able to prosecute those specific persons who are charged with war crimes .
",
11505,0,," such defendants , if convicted , can be ordered to pay the victims .
",
11506,0,," furthermore , the international court of justice is able to bring cases against specific states that are clearly identified as having broken the protocols of war .
",
11507,0,," as such , the united nations is both legally and institutionally capable of ensuring that the dictates of the geneva conventions are upheld , specifically the right of a combatant captured in a conflict zone to be granted prisoner of war status .
",
11508,0,," while this would provide a degree of protection for captured terrorists , it also means that terrorist organizations are subject to standards of conduct in war .
",
11509,0,," making them subject to the geneva conventions would uphold an incentive of restraint which might sometimes influence their conduct .
",
11510,1,,"this can take place in a number of different spheres.
",
11511,1,," at present, former leaders of the khmer rouge are being tried in cambodia, the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia continues to seek justice, and a small number of world war two nazi trials continue to be conducted.
",
11512,1,," since the establishment of the international criminal court in 2002, it has been primarily responsible for prosecutions of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
",
11513,1,," this question will also be relevant to the punishment of north african and middle eastern dictators, currently under threat by the arab spring.
",
11514,0,," the intention of many crimes of war is to destroy and demoralise individuals and communities .
",
11515,0,," as a result , they often cause on-going harm to victims who can not feel safe in their communities even after the conflict has ended .
",
11516,0,," for victims , prosecuting war criminals has a vital cathartic function in helping them , to some extent , to come to terms with the crimes committed against them and their families .
",
11517,0,," while full compensation is impossible , both the symbolic realisation of justice and the illustration of real commitment to prevention allows people to rebuild their lives to some extent .
",
11518,0,," failure to prosecute sends victims a message that the attacks on their freedoms were somehow acceptable .
",
11519,0,," for post-conflict societies to function , the tensions and divisions of the conflict must be brought out into the open and dealt with in order to be fully put to rest .
",
11520,0,," those most responsible for war crimes must be brought to justice , those involved in the regime but less culpable must have opportunity to make amends and victims must feel that they have been compensated .
",
11521,0,," this allows compromise and the potential for effective governance .
",
11522,0,," the alternative is to allow undiscussed , simmering hatreds and resentments to persist , which undermine growth and create a risk of further conflict .
",
11523,1,,"self-defense involves defending oneself, one's property or the wellbeing of another from physical harm.
",
11524,1,," the use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions, but the interpretation varies widely.
",
11525,1,," the self-defense laws of modern states find their origin in the roman law principle of dominium whereby any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the pater familias (head of household), and thus could be defended as such.
",
11526,1,," this right is recognized to varying extents in all states, and by the united nations.
",
11527,1,," the level of force one may use in self-defense, however, varies between countries, and usually centers around what constitutes ""reasonable force"", which is a fairly nebulous term in specific application, but relatively straightforward in a broad sense.
",
11528,1,," some critics of self-defense law argue that it is outmoded, belonging to an earlier, more barbarous time, while its supporters insist that it remains a necessity in a still dangerous, modern world.
",
11529,0,," debates on self-defense revolve around the central question of whether in fact an individual has the right to defend himself his property, and others against physical attack by means of force, or whether exerting force against another, even defensively, is itself a crime.
",
11530,0,,"the state 's primary duty is to protect its citizens , and to maintain order in society .
",
11531,0,," to maintain its legitimacy the state must guard the lives , liberty , and property of its citizens , who allow it to curtail their rights in exchange for its protection .
",
11532,0,," when crime is committed , it is a failure of the state .
",
11533,0,," but crime in the best-run state is a reality .
",
11534,0,," to make up for the inadequacies and inevitable shortcomings of the state , which can not be everywhere , individuals need the ability to make up for the shortfall of protection offered by the state .
",
11535,0,," this is why self-defense is necessary1 .
",
11536,0,," if the state denies the right to self-defense , while providing an inadequate security service , it allows a societal injustice to go uncorrected .
",
11537,0,," furthermore , the injustice inflicted by the state is uneven , as people in areas where there are fewer police and higher rates of crime people will of necessity have to resort to self-defense more often .
",
11538,0,," this is the case , for example , in inner cities where policing is limited and poverty rates high2 .
",
11539,0,," the need for self-defense is clear , since people are left to fend for themselves .
",
11540,0,," thus when the state fails people in poorer areas by providing them with inadequate services , it punishes them for trying to redress the failure .

",
11545,0,," people must , if the state wants people to retain faith in it and its ability to uphold the principles of justice , see justice as being done .
",
11546,0,," justice is not seen when people who defend themselves are punished for the `` crime '' of fighting back against those who would willfully violate their rights .
",
11547,0,," when the state punishes people for the `` crime '' of defending themselves , it appears to be taking the side of the wrongdoer .
",
11548,0,," it is true that everyone has rights , even criminals , but what is seen when people are punished for defending themselves is a placing of the rights of criminal over those of the real victims , who happened not to take the abuse of their assailants lying down .
",
11549,0,," the state sends a grotesque message that people should either meekly acquiesce to the demands of criminals should they threaten them or the people and things they care about , or fight back and be punished for it .
",
11550,0,," that is an unconscionable choice that the state can not legitimately expect people to make .
",
11551,0,," when the state passes laws that appear unjust , it invites acts of protest , such as jury nullification .
",
11552,0,," by challenging the right to self-defense , the state only serves to delegitimize itself and its laws in the eyes of its citizens .
",
11553,0,," when an individual is under immediate threat he has every right to defend himself from an aggressor .
",
11554,0,," just as when a wild animal threatens someone 's life he has the right to do whatever he can to survive , so too does the individual have the fundamental right to defend himself from another human 's aggressive acts .
",
11555,0,," this is a natural law , one that predates the existence of the social contract or the state .
",
11556,0,," the right to self-defense extends also to the defense of other people , as it is no less a right for someone to preserve his own existence by any means necessary , but also that of others , particularly those dependent upon him , or otherwise unable to defend themselves .
",
11557,0,," furthermore , self-defense must extend to the protection of property , since it is in many ways part of an individual1 .
",
11558,0,," a violation of one 's property is a violation of one 's self .
",
11559,0,," when burglars and marauders choose to violate these fundamental rights they make the conscious decision to violate other individuals .
",
11560,0,," it is just and proper that citizens be permitted to fight back to protect what is theirs by right .

",
11566,0,," the incentive to commit crime when it is illegal for people to defend themselves necessarily increases substantially1 .
",
11567,0,," even if the criminals assume some people will defend themselves anyway , they also know that people will likely hold back rather than fight .
",
11568,0,," denying the right to self-defense leaves innocents at the mercy of criminals who would violate their rights .
",
11569,0,," on the other hand , the acknowledgement of the right to self-defense deters crime , as people will be unwilling to risk their own safety in order to commit crimes .

",
11574,0,," people will naturally try to defend themselves , their family and their property when attacked .
",
11575,0,," it is right that the state should recognize that this is the case and that this will sometimes involve applying force against an intruder .
",
11576,0,," the current situation of allowing `` reasonable force '' is a common sense solution to the problem that allows for flexibility depending upon what the attacker is doing , it is right that this should be decided in the courts on a case by case basis rather than the government trying to work out a set of laws to determine what constitutes self-defense and what does not .
",
11577,0,," even if a right to self-defense was not recognized it would still be taken into account at trial .
",
11578,0,," juries are asked , when viewing a trial , to consider what a `` reasonable man '' would do in a given situation .
",

",
11584,1,,"most police officers in the united kingdom, ireland, norway, and new zealand (as well as in some other, smaller countries) are routinely unarmed, whereas in the rest of the world, policemen are routinely armed.
",
11585,1,," in the uk, some officers, such as those involved in diplomat protection work or airport/border security and anti-terrorism work do more routinely carry firearms, and armed response officers ( subject to certain authorisation protocols), can be quickly deployed as the need arises.
",
11586,1,,"  in other countries such as the united states, police weapons are frequently cited in relation to issues about police ‘militarization’ and concerning the abuse of police power—often the victimization of certain ethnic communities—and so there are sometimes calls for a reduction in police reliance on firepower and/or the adoption of other ‘less-lethal’ force technologies.
",
11587,0,,"  yet, in a rapidly changing society, where terrorism and armed crime (and, not least, police protection) remain pressing issues, it is questioned whether having unarmed police is anything more than naïve idealism.
",
11588,0,,"most countries in europe and north america have armed police forces , in part to deter criminal acts , but also to protect officers working in an armed or dangerous environment ' .
",
11589,0,," armed criminals operate in at least some areas of virtually every jurisdiction .
",
11590,0,," given this reality , a failure to routinely arm the police gives armed criminals a strong advantage in terms of their ability to threaten and commit violence , without any corresponding risk to themselves .
",
11591,0,," in bristol in england where police are not routinely armed the deployment of armed police in inner-city areas indefused gang tensions and reduced crime enough to allow the armed police to be withdrawn again .
",
11592,0,," only putting armed police in for brief periods will only have a short term impact , having permanently armed police is the only way to keep this deterrence in effect .
",
11593,0,," a world-wide ` meta-study ' of armed police patrols found some evidence that in high violence areas , targeted armed police patrols could chill down the tensions and reassure the community but the evidence was not very compelling and the authors acknowledged that such a ` sticking plaster ' approach was no long term solution to urban violence .
",
11594,0,," the old-fashioned notions of friendly neighborhood unarmed policing reflect the aspirations of a different age .
",
11595,0,," as armed violence has increased sharply in parts of the developed world , the police need to redefine their role so that it is a more appropriate response to contemporary problems .
",
11596,0,," in the uk , for example , gun crime almost doubled in the decade to, while the rise in london gun crime has tripled , the police need to be able to respond to this .
",
11597,0,," there is also danger in being a state with unarmed police when others states have armed police forces .
",
11598,0,," the unarmed nation may be seen as a `` soft touch '' compared to other regional nations .
",
11599,0,," this can encourage an importation of criminality .
",
11600,0,," there is a global increase in gun ownership , even in countries which did not traditionally think of themselves as having a large criminal gun culture .
",
11601,0,," presently 1.8 million legally held guns are accounted for in the uk .
",
11602,0,," this increases the risks to frontline police officers of being the victims of gun crime .
",
11603,0,," police officers should have a right to protect themselves .
",
11604,0,," fewer officers may die on duty if they were better able to protect themselves .
",
11605,0,," arming the police is essentially a matter of self-defence rather than being actively involved in regular firearms incidents .
",
11606,0,," this is shown by the fact that most routinely armed police never fire their weapon on active duty in their whole career .
",
11607,0,," if being a police officer is a safer job , then there will be a larger applicant pool to choose from , and thus better , more qualified police forces .
",
11608,0,," armed police reassure law-abiding citizens at a time when gun-related crime is increasing in most european countries and parts of north america .
",
11609,0,," in the ukgun crimes are committed every day .
",
11610,0,," much public opinion holds that something must be done to tackle this .
",
11611,0,," the sight of armed police officers patrolling the streets will not only deter gangs from harassing residents , but will instil in communities a confidence that they are being properly protected .
",
11612,0,," gangs are not interested in fighting the police ; they are more concerned about attacks from other gangs in their area who are willing to break the law and attack them unprovoked .
",
11613,0,," people feel safer when they see armed police , especially if they perceive them as a response to a heightened risk .
",
11614,0,," thus , for example , police officers at british airports routinely carry sub-machine guns , although there is no evidential pattern to suggest that this high-visibility weaponry offers any situational strategic advantage over a more subtle arming .
",
11615,0,," police officers are routinely armed already in a variety of situations .
",
11616,0,," this is a small step , as police officers are routinely armed already in a variety of situations , e.g. at airports and when providing security for political leaders or institutions .
",
11617,0,," as mentioned earlier armed police have even been used before on routine patrols in areas where there has been gun crime .
",
11618,0,," already rapid-response units of armed officers are available to deal with armed criminals , but these need to be specially summoned and authorised .
",
11619,0,," often , they arrive too late to do any good .
",
11620,0,," the next obvious step would be to have many more police armed so as to make this response much faster .
",
11621,1,,"“we build prisons to hold people we are afraid of, but fill them with people we are angry at.”
",
11622,1,,"the penalties handed out by the judiciary to convicted criminals are said to serve four objectives – to deter, to rehabilitate, to protect and to punish.
",
11623,1,," criminal sentencing should deter those contemplating criminal behaviour from carrying out criminal acts; the consequences of being convicted of a criminal act should outweigh any potential gain that act may deliver.
",
11624,1,," a sentence should also serve to address the causes of an individual’s criminal behaviour, and to provide him/her with the training, medical or psychological treatment and understanding of social norms that will ensure he does not resort to criminal activity again.
",
11625,1,," at the very least, a sentence should protect the public by actively preventing a criminal from committing further offences.
",
11626,1,,"the penalties for criminal behaviour available to judges and magistrates in liberal democracies include imprisonment, fines, restorative sentences such as community service, mandatory psychological treatment or addiction treatment and restrictions on freedom of movement and association (including curfews and “gang injunctions”).
",
11627,1,,"evidence indicates that despite the diversity of sentencing options available, the judiciary relies heavily on imprisonment as a response to criminal activity.
",
11628,1,," this is partly a result of political discourse that plays on the assumption that the threat of imprisonment can deter crime.
",
11629,1,," politicians who want to give the appearance of tackling crime and social disorder effectively typically increase the length of custodial sentences for certain crimes, and reduce judges’ discretion to award non-custodial sentences.
",
11630,1,,"it is typical for prisons to be viewed by judiciaries as an adequate punishment and vehicle for rehabilitating violent criminals, who have committed offences such as murder, rape, assault or aggravated muggings.
",
11631,1,," it is not certain that prison is the best environment in which to confront non-violent offenders, such as drug addicts, fraudsters and thieves.
",
11632,1,," rehabilitation, many argue, is more effective in lowering the risk of re-offending if handled in the community.
",
11633,0,," it is argued that imprisoning individuals found to be guilty of non-violent crimes is a disproportionate response to their actions and does not serve the objectives of criminal sentencing set out above .
",
11634,0,," criminal sentences must deliver a punishment in proportion to the crime an offender has committed .
",
11635,0,," a disproportionate sentence - using the death penalty to punish theft , for instance - is less likely to be perceived as a fair or rational response to criminal behaviour .
",
11636,0,," an offender who is punished excessively is more likely to see himself as the victim of injustice , and less likely to consider the impact of his own conduct .
",
11637,0,," a law abiding individual who that fears that jaywalking may result in jail time will have no confidence in the criminal justice system , and may begin seeking other sources of security .
",
11638,0,," there are many alternatives to penal sentences available to magistrates and judges .
",
11639,0,," using fines and curfews to restrict financial and personal liberty , alongside restorative forms of punishment such as community service , can provide a much more efficient way of condemning an individual 's criminal behaviour .
",
11640,0,," prison brings together individuals with a wide range of social and behavioural problems that incline them towards deviance and violence .
",
11641,0,," these individuals are placed in closed conditions with restricted access to productive activities .
",
11642,0,," in many western nations , a lack of funding and staff means that most prisoners have little to fill their time , and may be confined to their cells for up to twenty three hours a day .
",
11643,0,," the privations of prison make prisoners more , rather than less likely to engage in violent or exploitative behaviour .
",
11644,0,," prisoners in overcrowded , understaffed jails are more likely to develop mental illnesses and less likely to have such conditions diagnosed and treated .
",
11645,0,," the brutality of their surroundings makes prisoners more likely to seek the protection and comradeship offered by gangs or the comfort of intoxicants .
",
11646,0,," furthermore , the shame and isolation associated with incarceration cause prisoner 's non-criminal social networks to decay .
",
11647,0,," relationships with partners or spouses may break down .
",
11648,0,," contact with children may be limited .
",
11649,0,," families may shun the offender , leaving him with a social circle comprised mainly of fellow inmates .
",
11650,0,," these associations can prove toxic , leading offenders to validate each other 's behaviour and share knowledge about criminal activities .
",
11651,0,," finally , the stigma of criminality extends to employment .
",
11652,0,," businesses may be unwilling to employ those with criminal records , limiting ex-offenders ' opportunities for social reintegration .
",
11653,0,," prisons should be used only where the imperative to protect society from criminal behaviour can not be met by the imperative to rehabilitate .
",
11654,0,," a minority of offenders will be incorrigibly violent and uncontrollable , but under the status quo , these dangerous offenders not represent the majority of the prison population , see statistics above .
",
11655,0,," firstly , it should be noted that among many inmates , especially young men , criminal actions , including public order offences , assault and petty theft , are carried out on impulse .
",
11656,0,," impulsive behaviour is often influenced by alcohol and peer pressure .
",
11657,0,," under these circumstances , deterrence is ineffective .
",
11658,0,," in the light of these findings , deterrence can be seen as a matter of policing and detection , rather than a set of misleading assumptions based on an over-simplification of rational-actor theory .
",
11659,1,,"when individuals are convicted of a criminal offence, the sentencers (judges of magistrates) have many options for sentencing.
",
11660,1,," these may include prison sentences (known as custodial sentences) which are considered to be ‘reserved for the most serious offences’ where a fine or a community sentence cannot be ‘justified for the offence’, or where the court believes that the offence is so serious that the public need to be protected from the offender.
",
11661,1,," non-custodial sentences are offered for less severe crimes, and may include fines or community sentences, which include volunteer work, curfews, behavioural management courses, education and training or drug rehabilitation.
",
11662,1,," in 2008, 890,296 offenders in the uk received a fine while 190,171 offenders were given a community sentence.
",
11663,1,," however, 9,734 offenders were given an absolute discharge which meant that they received no punishment for their offences.
",
11664,1,," in america, sentencing guidelines vary by state; notably, some states allow capital punishment while others do not.
",
11665,1,," while sentencing guidelines may vary between states, and between countries, many countries are currently facing a common problem: that the prison systems are overburdened.
",
11666,1,,"this has brought discussion over whether sentencers rely too heavily on prisons as a form of justice.
",
11667,1,," in the uk, the ministry of justice announced that the number of inmates in prisons exceeded the ‘operational capacity’, with inmates being held in police or court cells to try and ease the pressure on the overburdened prison system.
",
11668,1,," the total number of inmates was 8,000 higher than the number which the prison service assessed would comprise a ‘good, decent standard of accommodation’.
",
11669,1,," there have also been serious questions about whether offenders are receiving the most appropriate punishment for them, or whether prison has become a blanket form of punishment.
",
11670,1,," one possible divide where we could draw a line between those who serve prison sentences and those who serve other forms of sentencing is between violence and non-violent offences.
",
11671,1,," violent offences might comprise crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape, assault, terrorism, domestic violence and armed robbery, as opposed to non-violent offences like theft, burglary, fraud, white-collar crime or drug offences.
",
11672,1,,"           the mechanism for this debate is fairly simple; that violent offenders who pose a serious safety risk to the public and those around them will be imprisoned, but those who commit non-violent crimes will instead receive alternative forms of punishment.
",
11673,1,," these alternative punishment will probably follow the standards already set up, but you may wish to argue that they will be increased – for example, fines will be increased, community service hours will be longer, education or training programmes will be more vigorous and so on.
",
11674,0,," it is practically unfeasible for the government to continue imprisoning people at this rate when prisons are already over capacity .
",
11675,0,," sooner or later , we will have to accept that there is too great a burden on our prison facilities for this kind of sentencing to continue being used in so many cases .
",
11676,0,," as such , we should give priority to imprisoning criminals who are genuinely dangerous and who have proved their violent tendencies already .
",
11677,0,," these kinds of offences are the most traumatic for victims and we owe it to them to make sure that these criminals are physically distanced from the rest of society .
",
11678,0,," however , while non-violent offenders have also committed a crime , they do not pose the same kind of danger which requires that they must be locked up ; in fact , those who commit small-scale crimes against society could be better rehabilitated by being forced to work to improve society through things like community service -- they will be less likely to damage a society which they feel a part of and have helped to build .
",
11679,0,," when people hold a greater stake in their community , they value it more and are reluctant to damage it .
",
11680,0,," those who advocate prison sentences for non-violent offenders often state two points : first , that the idea of being sent to prison is thought to act as a deterrent , and prevent people from committing crimes ; second , that people have do commit crimes and go to prison are less likely to re-offend .
",
11681,0,," this is false on both counts .
",
11682,0,," the idea of prison as a deterrent is immediately disproved by a rising violent crime rate , and the argument that these prisoners will not re-offend is disproved by the high rate of re-offending after a prison sentence , reaching up to% for some prisons .
",
11683,0,," moreover , re-offending statistics are normally only based on crimes committed within a year of release ; there may be many , many more ex-prisoners who re-offend who are not recorded within these statistics .
",
11684,0,," crimes which are committed impulsively and without forethought are rarely deterred by the possibility of punishment or being caught .
",
11685,0,," however , non-custodial methods , such as electronic tagging , have shown promise in reducing recidivism rates .
",
11686,0,," where prison has failed in deterring crimes , alternative forms of punishment have an opportunity to deter initial crime and lower rates of recidivism .
",
11687,0,," sentencers have a wide array of options in their sentencing , and indeed the sentencing council states that sentencing should ` never be a rigid , mechanistic or scientific process ' .
",
11688,0,," they have the option to make sentences more proportional to the crimes committed , and it is logical that the more serious crimes should receive the most serious sentences -- in this case , imprisonment .
",
11689,0,," other options for sentencing could include fines , unpaid work , rehabilitation programmes , alcohol or drug treatments , curfews and supervision requirements .
",
11690,0,," one key aim of sentencing is to convey moral censure , and to encourage offenders to truly consider the implications of their actions .
",
11691,0,," however , offenders who feel that they have been punished too severely or treated unfairly , or that those who have committed worse crimes receive the same sentence , are less likely to respond to that moral message and benefit from it .
",
11692,0,," this subsequently damages a key pillar of the criminal justice system -- the idea of rehabilitation .
",
11693,0,," criminals who see themselves as unfairly treated by society have no reason not to strike out against society again by committing another crime .
",
11694,0,," not only would alternative forms of punishment prevent this from happening , but it does not require the availability of prison and so is less of a burden on resources .
",
11695,0,," heavier fines , longer community sentences and more strict curfews can easily be given as an appropriate sentence for non-violent offenders .
",
11696,0,," merely having a criminal record which states that an individual was imprisoned , rather than given a more productive sentence such as community service , can have enormous implications on that individual 's future employment opportunities .
",
11697,0,," this is particularly pertinent if it is a first offence , committed in a moment of stupidity .
",
11698,0,," prisons are an isolating factor which separates the offender from their friends and family and distances them even further from the rest of society .
",
11699,0,," this creates a ` cycle of crime ' where the offender 's closest acquaintances are those who they met in prison , rather than a supportive network of family and friends who can help this person to be reintegrated into society .
",
11700,0,," not only does prison allow prisoners to share criminal ideas , but it may also reciprocally validate their illegal actions by creating a sense of camaraderie .
",
11701,0,," this makes rehabilitation , and recognition of society 's moral values , much more difficult .
",
11702,0,," ultimately , using prison for non-violent offences only introduces the offenders to more serious crimes , and makes it more difficult for the offenders themselves to be reintegrated , and for wider society to reintegrate them .
",
11703,1,,"electronic ‘intercept’ evidence can involve recording information which has been sent using any form of electronic media, including phone calls from fixed lines and mobiles (cellphones), emails, and pager or sms messages.
",
11704,1,," intercepted evidence can also include information and letters sent in the post.
",
11705,1,," by intercepting this information, many countries hope to prevent crime and increase national security through preventing violent incidents.
",
11706,1,," many countries already accept that wire-tapping is in fact necessary to prevent atrocities such as terrorism – particularly in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on new york - and that it is can be a highly effective way to combat ‘terror cells, war criminals and even mafia godfathers’.
",
11707,1,," however, not all countries agree that the evidence gathered through wire-tapping is in accordance with legal principles.
",
11708,1,," this has given rise to debates over whether intercepted and wire-tapped evidence should be admissible in court.
",
11709,1,,"many western countries currently deem that wire-tap evidence is admissible in court and is merely subject to the standard rules of evidence.
",
11710,1,," however, wire-tap and intercept evidence is, or is meant to be, a last resort when the court finds that ‘normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.’
",
11711,1,," this is generally interpreted by courts of law ‘to require only that law enforcement try some other techniques, not that they exhaust all reasonably available methods of obtaining the necessary evidence’.
",
11712,1,," in either case, intercept evidence is not supposed to be used as an automatic option without other difficulties presenting themselves in due course of the investigation.
",
11713,1,," while the law supposedly requires that law enforcement agents should not listen in on conversations which are obviously irrelevant to their case – such as personal phone calls among family and friends – it is rare that a wiretap is rejected in a court of law because the agents failed to minimise the tapping.
",
11714,1,,"britain, ireland and some american states still do not always allow the use of this evidence.
",
11715,1,," typically, warrants for taps can be issued by senior ministers (such as the home secretary in the uk) or by senior judges (in the usa) and must target a specific form of communication by a suspect rather than granted general authority to tap communication lines; for example, they may tap the landline, or emails, or a mobile phone.
",
11716,1,," under the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) in the usa, ‘roaming’ taps (taps which cover any form of communication used by a suspect) do exist but are very rare.
",
11717,1,," in conditions where a judge has granted authorisation for a ‘roaming’ tap, it is possible that all the public telephones (pay phones) in an area could be tapped if authorities suspected that terrorists could be in that neighbourhood.
",
11718,1,," this is evidently a much more invasive and blanket-form of communications tapping.
",
11719,1,," since terrorist activities around 9/11, the american government has been criticised for the extensive levels of wire-tapping and interception which were secretly authorised and even encouraged by the government.
",
11720,1,," particularly, the legal grounding for the creation of the tapping schemes remains unclear and controversial.wire-tapping tends to target three main types of crime: terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking.
",
11721,1,," many key drug trafficking trials in the usa have involved the admission of some kind of intercepted evidence.
",
11722,1,," however, in most countries a separate discussion is held either in court or with a judge after the warrant has been obtained for a tap in order to determine whether the specific intercept evidence is admissible, or whether it should be suppressed.
",
11723,1,," in the usa betweenand 1994, out of 8,489 criminal wiretaps judges across the us grantedsuppression motions to ‘exclude intercepted material from evidence’ but denied 3,060 pleas for a suppression motion.
",
11724,1,," this ultimately resulted in a 4.3% suppression rate.
",
11725,1,," this data shows that almost all of the evidence collected by interception and wiretapping within states which allow it to be used as evidence is ultimately used in court.
",
11726,1,," no fisa evidence which has been introduced to a criminal case has ever been excluded from that case.
",
11727,0,," wiretapping helps to make society safer ; we have the opportunity to prevent serious crime and to uphold the principle of prosecution in the justice system by catching criminals and convicting them .
",
11728,0,," for example , in the uk in, intercepts led to the seizure oftonnes of drugs and also detected wide-scale fraud and money laundering , resulting inarrests .
",
11729,0,," without this evidence , these criminals may have escaped the justice system and remained free in society to commit other crimes .
",
11730,0,," it is nonsensical to reject evidence which clearly implicates this individuals who would otherwise be released without charge .
",
11731,0,," as the threat of terrorism escalates and had already damaged many countries , refusal to use this evidence in court puts the public at serious risk and fails to act in the defence of the country in question .
",
11732,0,," for example , if the norwegian authorities had kept closer tabs on information passed through ebay , they might well have been able to apprehend anders breivik before he committed the massacre on utoya island .
",
11733,0,," wiretapping is unique in the variety of information it can provide ; it can show locations , times , the relationships between those involved and even record specific details of conspiracies .
",
11734,0,," accordingly , it can also be used to prove the innocence of somebody who might otherwise be wrongly accused or even wrongly imprisoned .
",
11735,0,," the obvious benefits to this motion demand that intercept evidence and wiretapping should be held as legitimate evidence in court .
",
11736,0,," intercept evidence offers the opportunity to speed up court trials and stop wasting time and money by providing information which could lead to a faster , more accurate verdict .
",
11737,0,," other western democracies who use wire-tap evidence believe that is has or will help to achieve criminal convictions , which demonstrates popular support for it as an effective and swift method of justice .
",
11738,0,," given that the uk has allowed wire-tapping in some specific cases , it seems to be that it is not the principle of intercept evidence itself which is viewed as unacceptable by these countries , but perhaps a need to set up a formalised system of the conditions when and where intercept evidence can be used .
",
11739,0,," david bickford , the former chief legal adviser to mi5 , has stated ` i know we have lost cases as a result of not using such evidence ' and other experts have called for the wide use of intercept evidence in court .
",
11740,0,," allowing the use of intercept evidence in the first place may well ensure that wire-taps are better carried out in a standardised , regulated manner britain in particular seems to hold a paradoxical set of values in relation to intercept evidence .
",
11741,0,," for example , british courts have allowed intercept material which has been lawfully obtained by foreign police forces .
",
11742,0,," one notable example of this was the conviction of the merseyside drugs squad chief elmore davies when it was discovered that he had a corrupt relationship with drug baron curtis warren .
",
11743,0,," the information which led to his conviction was collected on dutch mobile phones by the dutch police force , despite the fact that some of the conversations took place wholly within the uk .
",
11744,0,," however this -- bizarrely -- was allowed as evidence in a british court , despite the systematic rejection of intercept evidence in other cases .
",
11745,0,," when a country seems to recognise and even capitalise on the potential of intercept evidence in some cases but simultaneously reject it in others , the result is inconsistent legal standards which damage accountability and transparency of the entire state .
",
11746,0,," intercept evidence can be very useful for showing associations between groups of people , which can be incredibly helpful in cases such as conspiracies to link people and events together .
",
11747,0,," it can also expose inconsistencies or falsity in an individual 's alibi or personal character if they deny contact with a certain party where intercept evidence proves that they had communicated .
",
11748,0,," however , under the status quo the defence lawyer may not be authorised to intercept evidence which would prove their client 's innocence .
",
11749,0,," allowing such techniques would help to equalise the prosecution and defence ; after all , the aim of court is not to blindly prosecute the defendant , but to ascertain whether he or she is in fact guilty before any prosecution occurs .
",
11750,0,," widening the array of tools which can be used by both prosecution and defence helps to encourage a wider view of the case and arrive at a more accurate verdict .
",
11751,1,,"under the status quo in most english-speaking jurisdictions, a defendant’s previous convictions cannot be brought up in court until after the jury has given its verdict.
",
11752,1,," this includes scotland, america, canada, australia, new zealand and britain.
",
11753,1,," this is because these countries believe that each case should be evaluated on its own merits, and that ‘knowledge of previous offences would prejudice the outcome of a trial’.
",
11754,1,," however, other countries such as france allow previous convictions to be disclosed before a verdict is reached.
",
11755,1,," exceptions are made in britain in cases where the case under trial is ‘strikingly similar’ to a past offence, in which case it is believed that the value of the evidence ‘outweighs any prejudicial effect’.
",
11756,1,," previous convictions may also be disclosed if the defendant ‘falsely claims to be of good character’.
",
11757,1,," though previous convictions are not currently disclosed before the verdict of guilty or not guilty, judges may consider previous convictions when they decide the sentence for defendants deemed guilty.
",
11758,1,," there is a great interest in making sure that criminals are adequately punished for their crimes – particularly where recidivism shows that previous punishment has had little effect – in the interest of justice and public safety.
",
11759,1,,"                when choosing a mechanism for this debate, you may wish to think about the scope of argument and breadth of debate you want to have.
",
11760,1,," the first option is to defend a criminal justice system which allows previous convictions to be revealed in a case of similarity to past convictions, where the defendant falsely claims good character, or where the defendant attacks the character of a prosecution witness, as is the status quo in britain.
",
11761,1,," this takes on a smaller burden for the proposition and highlights particular points where past convictions could certainly be pertinent to the case and its relevance is pinpointed.
",
11762,1,," the other option is to defend the model used by france where previous convictions are routinely disclosed.
",
11763,1,," this requires the proposition to argue that the majority of cases would actively benefit from these disclosures by citing high recidivism rates after an initial offence and more general issues such as greater transparency within the courtroom.
",
11764,1,," this is a wider debate with more potential for principles, rather than practical, arguments.
",
11765,0,," it is unfair that those who repeatedly re-offend should be treated in the same manner as those who have committed one offence ; a singular offence could mark a mistake or accident in the defendant 's choices , but repeated criminal acts mark a habit and a lack of regret for past crimes .
",
11766,0,," failing to take past convictions into account can lead to many dangerous offenders being underestimated by the jury , and so released .
",
11767,0,," this is particularly pertinent in cases of child molestation , where child molesters have a particularly high rate of re-offending -- expected to be even ` larger than the reportedper cent ' - but ` only a small proportion of sexual offences against children result in a conviction ' .
",
11768,0,," this conviction rate , however , does rise for ` those with a history of prior sexual offences ' .
",
11769,0,," under the current conditions , this system is unfairly weighted against the innocent victims of repeated crime .
",
11770,0,," a higher conviction rate , informed by the knowledge of previous offences , helps to reach justice for these victims and their families , as well as promoting justice and the safety of the general public who find it frustrating that so many dangerous offenders are released without appropriate conviction .
",
11771,0,," moreover , jurors themselves lose confidence in the justice system when they find out that they have just acquitted a defendant who has committed a similar crime before .
",
11772,0,," one notable example of this was series of trials of kirk reid , who committed many sexual assaults against women including several instances of rape and who was ` wrongfully acquitted ' of his first offence in.
",
11773,0,," not only did his victim lose all sense of hope in the justice system -- she had faced her attacked and been discredited -- but one of the jurors at the trial who believed that he was guilty went on to criticise the justice system itself .
",
11774,0,," the current system seriously risks acquitting criminals who have already committed similar crimes ; it is time to rebalance the justice system to acknowledge the needs of the victims who suffer through wrongful acquittal of their attackers .
",
11775,0,," it is nonsensical to withhold evidence from a jury that might be necessary for them to reach an accurate verdict .
",
11776,0,," just because their verdict might be more prone to conviction rather than acquittal does not necessarily mean that this is an unfair or even inaccurate conclusion ; given that violent offenders are likely to re-offend , it may illuminate the truth rather than confuse it .
",
11777,0,," jurors should be allowed to weigh the relevance of previous convictions and compare them with the accusations of the trail at hand .
",
11778,0,," a criminal justice system which currently relies on the ability of the jury to make a decision can not legitimately choose to withhold evidence from them without innately biasing the trial itself .
",
11779,0,," as the uk government 's white paper states , ` we want less evidence to be withheld from the courts , on the principle that relevant evidence should be admissible ... magistrates , judges and juries have the common sense to evaluate relevant evidence and should be trusted to do so ' .
",
11780,0,," if we can not trust juries to decide which evidence is relevant to the verdict and which is not , then the entire use of juries in the criminal justice system should be reconsidered .
",
11781,0,," jurors are frequently affected by media coverage of particular cases , which makes it almost impossible for them to remain impartial in the idealistic way which opposition naively believes possible .
",
11782,0,," this creates a situation where the jury may be more affected by information which they have found out elsewhere -- for example on the news or in newspapers -- than the information which is presented to them in court .
",
11783,0,," there have been some cases where jurors search the internet to find the backgrounds to their cases , despite the fact that this is not allowed .
",
11784,0,," this evidently reflects that jurors feel that they have not been adequately informed and so seek facts elsewhere .
",
11785,0,," given that this need has been reflected by the jurors themselves , the court should give jurors all possible information and bring previous convictions into the open to ensure that they can base their verdict on reliable fact presented in court rather than resorting to sensationalist media .
",
11786,0,," this motion could allow innocent defendants to mount a stronger case .
",
11787,0,," this is because , if allowed , the previous convictions of prosecution witnesses would be admitted as evidence .
",
11788,0,," in this case , if a prosecution witness falsely claims good character in opposition to the defendant , any falsity could be more easily seen and weighed by the jury .
",
11789,0,," this solves a problem under that status quo where ` the threat of introducing his , the defendant 's , previous convictions will frequently inhibit him from introducing character evidence about the prosecution witness ' ; fear that the defendant 's convictions may weigh against them where the prosecution witness remains untouchable creates a discrepancy in the justice system .
",
11790,0,," however , if convictions on both sides were to be revealed anyway , then neither can falsely claim the character of the other and attempt to convince the jury of false information on this front .
",
11791,0,," at present in britain , some previous convictions may be disclosed if they bear a striking resemblance to the case at trial , if the defendant falsely claims to be of good character , or if they attack the character of a prosecution witness .
",
11792,0,," however , different judges invariable interpret these criteria in different ways , which leads to a wavering standard of trail where previous convictions may or may not be revealed .
",
11793,0,," it would be much more efficient and transparent to allow this motion and make court procedures more accessible .
",
11794,1,,"following the horrific killing ofelementary school children and teachers in newtown, connecticut, by adam lanza using a bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle, that resulted in all his victims being hit more than once, dianne feinstein has said that she will introduce a bill in the senate to ban assault weapons.
",
11795,1,," the united states has had an assault weapons ban before; fromto 2004.
",
11796,1,," the ban however lapsed inas it was set in motion for only ten years unless it was renewed, which congress decided not to do.
",
11797,1,," feinstein says that the new bill will “take my bill from '94 toand perfect it.”
",
11798,1,," detailed below is a summary of theassault weapons ban in the united states, which states ""title xi, subtitle a of the violent crime control and law enforcement act ofimposed a 10-year ban on the “manufacture, transfer, and possession” of certain semiautomatic firearms designated as assault weapons (aws).
",
11799,1,," the ban is directed at semiautomatic firearms that have features that appear useful in military and criminal context and rifles but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defence (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers).
",
11800,1,," the law bansmodels and variations by name, as well as revolving cylinder shotguns.
",
11801,1,," it also has a “features test” provision banning other semiautomatics having two or more military-style features…the ban also prohibits most ammunition feeding devices holding more thanrounds of ammunition (referred to as large capacity magazines, or lcms).
",
11802,1,," aloln lcm is arguably the most functionally important feature of most aws, many of which have magazines holdingor more rounds.
",
11803,1,," the lcm ban’s reach is broader than that of the aw ban because many non-banned semiautomatics accept lcms.
",
11804,1,," approximately 18% of civilian-owned firearms and 21% of civilian-owned handguns were equipped with lcms as of 1994.”
",
11805,1,,"the previous ban exempted assault weapons and large capacity magazines manufactured before the law’sintroduction.
",
11806,1,," leaving the loophole that older guns could still be imported with the result that 4.7 million pre-ban lcms were imported into the usa fromthrough 2000.
",
11807,1,," this is a loophole feinstein claims would be eliminated in the new bill as ""it will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession.
",
11808,1,,"  not retroactively but prospectively.
",
11809,1,," and it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more thanbullets.""
",
11810,1,," however as the ban won’t be retroactive it will not take assault weapons off the streets entirely if it was to be passed; its most significant result could potentially be as a stepping stone if it were to show some value in the regulation of firearms.
",
11811,1,,"any attempt to renew the ban would be controversial, even after two large scale shootings, one in aurora and the other in newtown.
",
11812,1,," the national rifle association is a powerful lobbying group that would fight any attempt to ban assault weapons.
",
11813,1,," indeed progress has in recent decades been going in favour of reaffirming the right to hold arms not to limit it.
",
11814,1,," in district of columbia v. heller the supreme court ruled that the right to possess a firearm was unconnected with service in a militia and so overturned a ban in the district of columbia on handguns and init was ruled in mcdonald v chicago that the second amendment is incorporated under the fourteenth amendment so the right to bear arms is protected from infringement by local and state government as well as federal government.
",
11815,1,,"n.b. while this debate is assuming that retroactively banning assault weapons will not be on the table if it was this would make proposition’s case much easier as it is rather a large loophole and many of the arguments would be much more powerful with a more complete ban.
",
11816,0,," put simply assault weapons are designed for assault , therefore their proliferation should be prohibited in law .
",
11817,0,," to put things into the general context of gun crime within the united states every year 17,000 people are killed ,percent of them with guns and nearly 20,000 people commit suicide by shooting themselves .
",
11818,0,," murder by gunfire particularly affects children , in total well over a million americans have died in this manner andpeople continue to be shot in the states every day .
",
11819,0,," so some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point .
",
11820,0,," out ofmass murders sincealmost half the weapons used ,out of, were semi-automatic handguns and more thanwere assault weapons .
",
11821,0,," the period of the federal assault weapons ban from 1994-2004 with the exception of, the year of the columbine massacre , which notably involved a semi-automatic produced before the ban , was also a peaceful period in terms of numbers of mass shootings .
",
11822,0,," while assault weapons are responsible for a relatively small amount of total gun deaths in the usa that is not a good reason for not banning them ; any life saved is worthwhile .
",
11823,0,," taking the low estimate of% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high% means 630-700 lives that could be saved .
",
11824,0,," australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns , in australia 's case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced .
",
11825,0,," in the wake of a mass shooting in port arthur instrict gun laws were implemented .
",
11826,0,," an evaluation by the australian national university found laws saved $million and halved the number of people killed by guns savinglives every year .
",
11827,0,," as new york mayor michael bloomberg argues `` we 've got to really question whether military-style weapons with big magazines belong on the streets of america in this day and age . ''
",
11828,0,," police chiefs such as ralph godbee of detroit argue `` we 're talking about weapons that are made for war ... you can shoottorounds within a minute . ''
",
11829,0,," in a self defense scenario the person defending themselves need to have enough ammunition to provide deterrence , however they would have to be unwise to take on several assailants so there should be little need to have more thanrounds in the magazine .
",
11830,0,," law enforcement expert leonard j. supenski has testified `` because of potential harm to others in the household , passersby , and bystanders , too much firepower is a hazard '' as in self defense , the defenders will often fire until they have expended all the bullets in their magazine .
",
11831,0,," to use an assault weapon would to spray an assailant with bullets from an assault weapon would be using disproportionate force that will not only harm the assailant but will likely hit anyone else nearby .
",
11832,0,," even those who are against an assault weapons ban such as david kopel concede that for the most part these are not useful weapons for hunting .
",
11833,0,," these weapons are `` intended to wound rather than to kill '' so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer .
",
11834,0,," moreover he also concedes `` a hunter will carry only a few rounds '' so the large capacity magazine is also useless for sport .
",
11835,0,," many who are pro guns argue that it would be illegitimate for assault weapons to be banned while the police have them .
",
11836,0,," police forces , however , are going to be much more likely , and able to give them up when a ban is in place .
",
11837,0,," the police do n't want to be involved in an arms race with criminals to have the biggest guns ; just look at the british police force where there is little gun crime and few shootings of police officers it is not felt that there is the need to have police armed with more than a taser or even truncheon .
",
11838,0,," put simply a ban on assault weapons can help reverse the arms race between police and criminals .
",
11839,0,," civil liberties would also be enhanced as law enforcement agencies would not need to devote so many resources into monitoring assault weapons purchases and those who have done the purchasing .
",
11840,0,," instead they would be able to simply target all assault weapons purchases as needing immediate attention .
",
11841,0,," finally we must remember that this ban enhances the highest liberty at all ; life .
",
11842,0,," today as justice breyer says `` gun possession presents a greater risk of taking innocent lives '' than not having a gun .
",
11843,0,," yes a ban would not immediately take assault weapons off the streets but there would be significant long term benefits as highlighted by connecticut senator joe liberman `` we ought to restore the assault weapons ban -- not to take anybody 's guns away that they have now , but to stop the manufacturing of these weapons . ''
",
11844,0,," the ban would stop manufacturers from making the weapons and with the legislation improved from theversion it would be possible to prevent the cosmetic changes that were made to keep guns on the market .
",
11845,0,," this would mean that prices both in the usa and globally would increase as there would be less supply .
",
11846,0,," one positive result might also be help to change the united states ' position on the arms trade treaty which would further restrict global supply .
",
11847,0,," this would answer mexican calls to cut off the supply of guns into the country that helps make the drugs violence in the country so deadly both by meaning less of the weapons are made and by helping to cut off the route through which weapons get into mexico .
",
11848,0,," a ban on assault weapons would not fix mexico but it would deprive arms smugglers of the closest , easiest and cheapest place to buy the arms used by the drugs cartels .
",
11849,1,,"many of the arguments in this debate relate directly to interpretation of the second amendment to the constitution of the united states of america: ""a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to bear arms, shall not be infringed.
",
11850,1,,"""a number of questions frame the  second amendment.
",
11851,1,," is it important in the modern day to offer citizens a right to gun ownership for the purpose of protecting against government tyranny?
",
11852,1,," would handguns be a necessary part of this check against an excessively powerful state?
",
11853,1,," what kinds of arms are necessary to an individual's ability to defend themselves and their family?
",
11854,1,," are handguns necessary?
",
11855,1,," do arms, and the right to bear them, increase violence, crime, and murder rates.
",
11856,1,," does a right to bear arms generally decrease public safety?
",
11857,1,," or, does an entitlement to carry handguns empower good citizens to take action against, ""check"", and generally deter bad citizens from committing crimes?
",
11858,1,," are handguns particularly conducive to gang violence because they are concealable?
",
11859,1,," or does the wide availability of firearms deter gangsters (creating a fear and uncertainty among criminals that good citizens are carrying them)?
",
11860,1,," are dc's circumstances exceptional?
",
11861,1,," does its history of crime and violence warrant exceptional measures such as a handgun ban?
",
11862,1,," does its status as the nation's capital also mean that exceptional cautions must be taken?
",
11863,1,,"in this debate, proposition should seek to propose a motion that implements a ban similar to the originalprohibition – restricting the sale and possession of handguns that are not already registered to a particular owner.
",
11864,1,," they can choose to implement a system where remaining guns are phased out over time with some measure of gun amnesty.
",
11865,1,," (a process where the remaining guns are given anonymously to the police).
",
11866,1,," it is important to note that opposition arguments along the line that the ban would be unconstitutional do not stand up in british parliamentary debating, unless significant harm from changing the constitution can be proved.
",
11867,1,," this is because british parliamentary debating assumes that the legislation will pass without hindrance should proposition win and that measures to allow this will be implemented.
",
11868,1,," as such a change in the constitution to make the handgun ban legal is assumed to be possible under the terms of the debate.
",
11869,1,," consequently, proposition’s burden in this debate is to show that such a ban would be beneficial and justifiable, not to show that it would be constitutional.
",
11870,0,," under the status quo the state exists to protect the security of its citizens .
",
11871,0,," it does so by maintaining a monopoly of violence with the consent of its citizens .
",
11872,0,," us citizens have been allowed to bear small arms as a symbolic representation of their ability to rise up against state oppression should it ever occur .
",
11873,0,," that is , to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has .
",
11874,0,," it is important to note that the state has the monopoly of violence such that it can protect its citizens in the best possible way .
",
11875,0,," in the same way , the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm .
",
11876,0,," this means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state .
",
11877,0,," in a similar fashion to the above , should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another , it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state 's monopoly on violence is revoked , the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked .
",
11878,0,," given that this does not occur in every single part of the u.s. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated .
",
11879,0,," in this case the ban is limited to dc however it could potentially extend to other areas in the u.s. which suffer similar problems .2 handguns are specifically worse than most other weapons .
",
11880,0,," they are weapons which are both concealable and portable .
",
11881,0,," shotguns and rifles can easily be identified from a long distance making it easier to avoid those who are carrying them or conversely for the authorities check their motives for carrying arms .
",
11882,0,," handguns , being ranged weapons , as opposed to knives , prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them .
",
11883,0,," because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police .
",
11884,0,," further , they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves , but also need to appear unassuming for clients .
",
11885,0,," as such , handguns , where they are freely available , are often used by most criminals for these purposes .
",
11886,0,," given that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries - as a result of incompetence or recklessness - than a knife , it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available .4 aside from the fact that handguns are uniquely dangerous weapons , when the handgun ban was in place in dc , there was a reported decrease in crime in the area .
",
11887,0,," inthe year immediately following the ban the u.s. conference of mayors reported robberies , assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in dc sharply .
",
11888,0,," further , inthe university of maryland published a study in the new england journal of medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before, claiming that the ban had preventeddeaths in dc per year .5 it is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics , such as stop and search , significantly more effective .
",
11889,0,," if criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it .
",
11890,0,," however , it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large .
",
11891,0,," specifically , the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are , but simply ca n't pin them for arrest , such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street .
",
11892,1,,"suicide is the act of intentionally causing ones death.
",
11893,1,," there are almost a million suicides every year with ten to twenty times more suicide attempts.
",
11894,1,," suicide has traditionally been illegal in many western countries as it is seen by the church as a mortal sin.
",
11895,1,," there is obviously little way of punishing people who have succeeded in the attempt however there have been punishments either in the form of treatment for the body, such as not getting a christian burial, or for the family who in the middle ages were stripped of their possessions.
",
11896,1,," inthere wereprosecutions for attempted suicide in the uk.
",
11897,1,," but with the rise of secularism and doubts about the success of a criminal deterrent, the prohibition of suicide has been lifted in many, for example, england and wales decriminalised suicide in 1961.
",
11898,1,," but with rising suicide rates many have asked the question: should suicide again be made a criminal offence?
",
11899,0,," suicide is a waste of life .
",
11900,0,," it is an immoral act that ignores the sacrosanct nature of human life -- something that is universally considered to be the case as shown by being something nearly all religions consider to be the case .
",
11901,0,," failure to criminalize such a flagrant violation of the sanctity of human life condemns any society as irreligious and immoral .
",
11902,0,," nowadays we hear everyone talking about human rights ; we hear precious little about human obligations .
",
11903,0,," if we believe in the moral worth of human rights we do so because we think that human life is a wonderful thing and something with which we should not interfere .
",
11904,0,," whether the interference is by others or by ourselves , any action that denigrates human life is morally wrong for precisely the reason that we support human rights .
",
11905,0,," we have an obligation to preserve all life , including our own .
",
11906,0,," suicide is an entirely selfish act that causes immense pain and suffering for those loved ones that are left behind .
",
11907,0,," it is also cowardly ; rather than facing your problems and being strong , you instead take the easy way out and kill yourself .
",
11908,0,," it is important , therefore , to instil a strong sense of responsibility to one 's family and for one 's affairs and to do this by punishing those who try and fail to perpetrate this selfish and cowardly act .
",
11909,0,," individual action is shaped by what norms and standards are set by society .
",
11910,0,," by prohibiting suicide , society sends out a message that it is not an acceptable action .
",
11911,0,," legislation is a useful social tool , in that it proscribes the limits of individual action .
",
11912,0,," and by failing to prohibit suicide , society fails to add the ultimate sanction of its laws into the balance of any decision whether or not to commit suicide .
",
11913,0,," many of those who have tried and failed to commit suicide never attempt it again .
",
11914,0,," this suggests that many who kill themselves do so because of their particular short-term circumstances , perhaps while ill , suffering financial problems or under emotional stress , rather than through a considered and rational decision .
",
11915,0,," more than% of suicides are precipitated by intimate partner problems , more than% by jobs problems and% by financial problems .
",
11916,0,," given this , even a small deterrent will help to save many lives that are currently wasted needlessly .
",
11917,0,," like abortion , euthanasia , cloning and genetic engineering , suicide undermines the sanctity and inviolability of the human body .
",
11918,0,," it is legitimate to legislate against such actions because the sanctity of the human body is an intrinsic constituent part of the respect for human dignity , which is the sine qua non of social life in any country .
",
11919,1,,"there are many relationships in which a duty of confidentiality is owed.
",
11920,1,," this is true of doctor and patient relationships, relationships of employees to employers and also to lawyers and their clients.
",
11921,1,," the overarching principle behind all of these confidences is that there are some relationships that require complete honesty and openness in order for the correct result to be obtained.
",
11922,1,," if a business thought its employees could spread news about them freely and without consequence, they would not let their employees know aspects of the business and therefore the business would work less efficiently.
",
11923,1,," if a patient did not tell their doctor the truth of their illness through fear their family would be told then the doctor could not efficiently cure the patient.
",
11924,1,," the same is true of the lawyer and client relationship.
",
11925,0,," however, given the nature of the legal environment and the law of privacy as it currently stands, is client-attorney privilege no longer desirable?
",
11926,0,,"if communications between an attorney and their client are confidential , then it allows for lies to be put forward to the court in order to defend someone who is guilty .
",
11927,0,," in the case of a criminal matter , it could mean that even though a defendant has stated they are guilty to their attorney , they will not be found to be guilty .
",
11928,0,," every attorney wants to win their case , and if they are likely to conceal the confession of their client if it means their client will be released .
",
11929,0,," as the communication is confidential , such confession will not be informed to the court and the attorney would not be exposed for their lies .
",
11930,0,," the confidential nature of the communications between attorney and client open the possibility for a system of justice based upon lies .
",
11931,0,," this is not just and so the attorney-client privilege should be abolished .
",
11932,0,," a system of just law is not based on opinions or ideologies .
",
11933,0,," it is about finding evidence and using that evidence to prove or disprove either to ` beyond reasonable doubt ' for criminal cases or ` on the balance of probabilities ' for civil and commercial matters .
",
11934,0,," the burden is on the importance of the evidence .
",
11935,0,," it does not make sense for a legal system to on one hand place so much emphasis on evidence and lock away documents which will contain a vast array of empirical evidence with the other .
",
11936,0,," instead , attorney-client privilege should be abolished and all evidence should be in justices domain in order to ensure that the law achieves a just result .
",
11937,0,," with the attorney-client privilege in place , there is an excessive burden on the solicitor to cope with any information their client may give to them on a confidential basis .
",
11938,0,," this means they have to deal with the information alone .
",
11939,0,," this is an excessive moral burden for any individual to have and should not be justified on the basis that a solicitor is there to advance the interests of their client .
",
11940,0,," it should not be the solicitors role to deal with moral conflicts alone .
",
11941,0,," one of the principles behind allowing communications between a solicitor and their client to be privileged is that a solicitor is independent of their client and so will not breach laws themselves in order to attain their clients objectives .
",
11942,0,," however , after the recession ofand the legal services actthe position of in house lawyer is more prevalent .
",
11943,0,," in house lawyers are not financially independent .
",
11944,0,," they are in fact employees of their ` client ' .
",
11945,0,," this eradicates the principle behind client-attorney privilege and therefore the privilege itself is now irrelevant and should be eradicated .
",
11946,0,," most obviously it seems unnecessary for there to be attorney client privilege when the defendant 's interests can not be adversely affected .
",
11947,0,," for example when the confidential information just does not incriminate the client himself but it might clear somebody else , or when the client is dead .
",
11948,0,," few people will be discouraged from being candid with their lawyers if there is merely the possibility that the communications may be disclosed after their death .
",
11949,0,," in addition there are situations where the client 's interest may indeed be hurt but where this should be outweighed by some other very important public interest .
",
11950,0,," in other words perhaps there should be ` necessity ' or ` public interest ' or ` in the interests of justice ' balancing exceptions to the privilege .
",
11951,0,," this would be the case when public safety is at risk , for example if the client holds some very vital information but is not willing to disclose it to anyone other than his lawyer .
",
11952,0,," in such cases the courts should weigh up and balance the client 's interests against society 's and make the decision accordingly rather than rigidly sticking to attorney-client privilege .
",
11953,1,,"democratic states, while all aiming to uphold justice through a fair trial, have different approaches to the trials themselves.
",
11954,1,," in the united states, well-publicised criminal trials can be televised, or documentaries can later portray the court proceedings.
",
11955,1,," one notable example of this is the case of o.j simpson.
",
11956,1,," however, in france, the media is not allowed to show the face of any suspect who has not yet been found guilty - and the french were outraged that american media showed dominique strauss-kahn’s face before his trial began.
",
11957,1,," the dutch justice system allows the press to refer to the accused, but only by their ‘first names and last initials’.
",
11958,1,," all of this indicated that the justice system is not a matter of black-and-white interpretation, but it very sensitive to change.
",
11959,1,," those who oppose televised court cases argue that it only serves to make court cases theatrical, often focusing more on entertainment factor, or the lawyers and judges involved (particularly in the o.j simpson trial), than achieving justice for its own sake.
",
11960,1,," televising court cases can bring a huge amount of public attention, whether overwhelming sympathy for the victim-figure, or hatred for the accused.
",
11961,1,,"            a conventional proposition case would argue that the whole court proceedings would be recorded by cameras around the courtroom.
",
11962,1,," the faces of the jurors would not be shown (to try and avoid distorted verdicts).
",
11963,1,," however, this in itself leans towards an admission that televising court cases could distort justice.
",
11964,1,," the proposition would most likely exclude cases involving national security, or other cases where the presence of an audience is already limited, such as cases involving children.
",
11965,1,," it is already recognised that this information is too sensitive for public viewing; a prop line that acknowledges this is much easier to defend and falls into standards which are already in place.
",
11966,0,," given that people are already allowed to watch court proceedings from the public gallery -- including the judicial committee of the house of lords in the uk , and the supreme court in the us -- there is little reason why this should not be extended to give better access across the nation to anybody who wants to watch .
",
11967,0,," those with full-time jobs or who live far away from the courts are currently unfairly limited in this respect , and those who do wish to attend well-publicised trials often have to arrive hours in advance to get a seat .
",
11968,0,," individuals should not have to give up so much time and money just to be able to watch a democratic proceeding , which is a cornerstone of democratic nations .
",
11969,0,," given that many closed trials such as the trial of the guantánamo bay terrorism suspects have still led to intense media coverage , we would be better off showing the courts to be transparent and just instead of vainly trying to hide everything behind closed doors .
",
11970,0,," it 's difficult for people to have faith in a system which is normally hidden from them .
",
11971,0,," as long as the court proceedings themselves are hidden , the public and the media will continue to judge the judiciary based on unfortunate comments , or comments taken out of context , by judges .
",
11972,0,," this means that the legal system becomes distorted and confusing in the public eye .
",
11973,0,," televising trials would dispel this image by proving the competence , efficiency and sensitivity of most judges in the legal system , and restore faith in it as a whole .
",
11974,0,," if these cameras were introduced , then the public would have something to measure media sensationalism against .
",
11975,0,," instead of relying on journalistic evidence , the public would be able to literally see for themselves how the judge acted , and how the victim and defendant appeared .
",
11976,0,," in, the case of chandler vs florida proved that cameras could operate in courtrooms which ` did not inherently violate due process ' while improving the transparency of courtrooms to the general public .
",
11977,0,," cameras in the courtroom will prevent the public from being misled about the court proceedings .
",
11978,0,," if the defendant is convicted of a crime , they have a right to appeal in the uk and us .
",
11979,0,," however , this is made difficult for another court to re-assess the conviction if they can not know how reliable evidence was in the first trial .
",
11980,0,," without film recordings of court trials , judges who have the duty to re-examine the case are unable to see witness testimonies ; though new evidence does sometimes come to light during the course of an appeal , it would be easier to assess this new evidence if the judges also had knowledge of how the first trial went .
",
11981,0,," if the judges could watch a video of the first trial , they could judge the demeanour , body language and general impression given by each witness in the first trial .
",
11982,0,," body language can affect a court 's perception of a witness , but this information could not be gained by a transcript .
",
11983,0,," however , this evidence may be important for a new verdict to be reached .
",
11984,0,," placing cameras into courtrooms encourages the judiciary and lawyers to increase their efficiency and have high standards of behaviour , because they are aware that it will be carried outside of the courtroom by public viewing .
",
11985,0,," the introductions of cameras to the houses of parliament in the uk resulted in significantly improved standards of debate , greater punctuality , and greater attendance of mps .
",
11986,0,," we can expect this same principle to continue in courtrooms when cameras are put in place .
",
11987,1,,"habeas corpus is a centuries old legal mechanism that prevents the government from arbitrarily detaining its citizens.
",
11988,1,," it originated in medieval england and operates in many countries influenced by the english common law tradition.
",
11989,1,," in the us, habeas corpus is a petition to a state or federal court, on behalf of a prisoner, requesting that the court review the basis of the person’s detention.
",
11990,1,," habeas corpus is considered to be one of the foundations of constitutional democracy and the principle has been adopted by many countries throughout the world.
",
11991,1,," in the united states habeas corpus is a fundamental piece of the legal system that allows capital defendants to challenge death penalty rulings and immigration detainees to challenge the legality of their detention.
",
11992,1,," it is protected by article i, sectionof the constitution, which states, “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.”
",
11993,1,,"after the attacks of september2001, the bush administration in the us began to challenge the applicability of habeas corpus to terror suspect detainees.
",
11994,1,," the legal and political battles around restrictions to habeas corpus have been fierce.
",
11995,1,," most recently, in boumediene vs bush, the supreme court held that terror suspects detained at guantanamo bay are protected by habeas corpus.
",
11996,0,," restricting suspected terrorists ' rights to challenge their detention is necessary to ensure that that individual can not participate in future terrorist activities .
",
11997,0,," the attacks of september 11th constituted a catastrophic and unprecedented attack on us soil , and the measures undertaken by the us at guantanamo bay , in holding many terrorist suspects without trial , are necessary to prevent future attacks of that nature .
",
11998,0,," terror suspects still have recourse to military tribunals , which contain many of the same safeguards as the federal court system .
",
11999,0,," unlawful enemy combatants are not us citizens .
",
12000,0,," the only connection they have to the us is the desire to destroy it .
",
12001,0,," as such , they do not fall within the group of people the constitution is intended to protect .
",
12002,0,," there is a longstanding tradition of suspending habeas corpus protections during times of war and conflict .
",
12003,0,," for example , president lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the civil war .
",
12004,0,," habeas corpus was also suspended briefly in the hawaii during world war ii , immediately after the attacks on pearl harbour .
",
12005,0,," in the uk , habeas corpus was suspended in, after the french declared war on britain , and in, in order to arrest parliamentary reformers .
",
12006,0,," inhabeas corpus was again suspended in the uk in order that ira suspects could be arrested and detained .
",
12007,0,," 9/11 and other al qaeda plots require that western countries respond in just as determined a way .
",
12008,0,," the war on terror may not follow the rules of traditional warfare , but it is a war nonetheless .
",
12009,0,," these precedents show that , in certain circumstances , the suspension of habeas corpus is both necessary and justified .
",
12010,1,,"repressive governments, here defined as governments that are anti-democratic, that do not afford general civil rights to their citizens, and that do not have a robust respect for the rule of law, have sought to quell dissent and the voices of reform by many means.
",
12011,1,," through a sophisticated security apparatus, states have succeeded in making most forms of physical protest extremely difficult.
",
12012,1,," demonstrations and clandestine organization are suppressed with the same vigour and effectiveness.
",
12013,1,," countries like china, north korea, cuba, and iran have all developed these strategies with precision.
",
12014,1,,"one of the only avenues people in these countries feel capable of turning to is in the blogosphere.
",
12015,1,," bloggers are at the forefront of the battle for political rights in china and cuba.
",
12016,1,," but their zeal often leads them to fall foul of the government, and many end up harassed by state agents, or even in prison.
",
12017,1,," in vietnam bloggers have been reporting on crackdowns on house churches and other human rights abuses.
",
12018,1,," the response is surveillance and ‘working sessions’ with police interrogators.
",
12019,1,," bloggers such as nguyen van hai, ta phong tan, and phanh thanh hai were jailed for ‘anti-state propaganda’ and nguyen hoang vi beaten and stripped by police officers.
",
12020,1,," in all such cases no matter what country the government seeks to undermine the writers by accusing them of wicked plots, treason, and manipulation by outside power.
",
12021,1,,"the appropriate response to all this that this house, defined broadly as democratic states and narrowly as the western liberal democracies, should adopt in response to all this is contentious.
",
12022,1,," this focuses on the decision to offer amnesty to those facing prosecution in their native countries.
",
12023,1,," this policy has been implemented to various degrees already in some countries, with the united states, for example, housing dissidents from china, cuba, and elsewhere.
",
12024,1,," but whether this is good policy, whether it should be expanded or ended, remains to be seen.
",
12025,0,," the internet has become the paramount means of voicing dissent within repressive regimes .
",
12026,0,," as the technology regimes have to keep control of their people increases , with access to high-tech surveillance technology adding to their already formidable arsenals of physical oppression , the internet has become the only platform to express meaningful dissent .
",
12027,0,," the jasmine revolution in tunisia , for example , wherein people mobilized to overthrow their dictator has even been dubbed the twitter revolution .
",
12028,0,," bloggers have become a major voice of dissent in other repressive regimes , including cuba and china .
",
12029,0,," yet the blog platform is far from safe .
",
12030,0,," governments have sought to crack down on bloggers ' ability to dissent , using draconian methods like imprisonment to cow them into silence .
",
12031,0,," in china the arrests of bloggers like zhai xiaobing , who was arrested and detained for simply posting a joke about communist party , have served to frighten many into silence .
",
12032,0,," so long as information is denied to the public , governments are able to maintain their repression .
",
12033,0,," only external help from democratic , or at least more liberal , states can provide the safe haven for people who have rubbed their governments the wrong way in their pursuit of reform and justice .
",
12034,0,," the universality of human rights , of the freedom of speech and of due process is all touted as crucial by the world 's democracies .
",
12035,0,," democratic countries are frequently vocal on the subject of liberty , on the superiority of their system of government that provides for the best protection of human dignity .
",
12036,0,," by offering amnesty to bloggers , the people standing at the forefront of the democratic cause in oppressive regimes , western countries take a largely low-cost action that provides for the security and safety of some the bravest people in the public arena .
",
12037,0,," the west must stop kowtowing to oppression and make a stand to offer an umbrella of protection to those who need it .
",
12038,0,," that protection is absolutely crucial to the development of more dissent in the blogosphere and on the ground .
",
12039,0,," only by nurturing dissent can it ever take root and overcome the vast powers of authoritarian government .
",
12040,0,," the promise of protection is hugely powerful because it gives bloggers a safety net to fall back on .
",
12041,0,," those already active will feel more empowered to speak out against their oppressors , and some currently cowed by fear will have the courage to speak up .
",
12042,0,," the guarantee of amnesty also removes the perceived randomness of such offerings that currently occur , as in the recent case of cuba in which two bloggers of similar pedigree asked for asylum in the us , but only one received it .
",
12043,0,," such inconsistency has bred fear in the minds of dissidents .
",
12044,0,," this policy would correct for it and help bolster the cause of justice on all fronts .
",
12045,0,," it is through offering amnesty that democracies can provide the catalyst for the change they avow to be the paramount aim of human civilization .
",
12046,0,," in offering amnesty western governments make an exceptionally powerful public statement in the international arena , an area in which they already hold great sway as norm-setters .
",
12047,0,," it is a statement that shows that they will not simply ignore the abuses of power used by repressive regimes to stifle dissent and the voices of reform .
",
12048,0,," ultimately , the power of oppressors to act with impunity is the product of democracies ' unwillingness to challenge them .
",
12049,0,," authoritarian regimes often claim to value freedom of the press , for example articleof the constitution of the people 's republic of china guarantees it , and this policy challenges them to make their practice more like what they preach .
",
12050,0,," a policy of amnesty for those threatened with the lash of tyranny serves to actively protect those people while at the same time upholding the avowed principles of justice and fairness the west proclaims .
",
12051,0,," this will show that the west does not play favourites or turn a blind eye to these repressions , but is an active player , willing to step in to shield those who share its dreams of a freer world .
",
12052,0,," the international ridicule these policies can generate will serve to shame regimes into relaxing their policies and to embrace at least a road to reform .
",
12053,0,," nor should it be assumed that this rhetoric will have no real consequences , many authoritarian regimes encourage investment by companies from democratic countries , such investment is less likely when that company 's home state is publically condemning that state by granting amnesties to dissident bloggers .
",
12054,1,,"organ donations are one of the most vital steps of progress made in the field of medicine.
",
12055,1,," where the failure of a vital organ previously would lead to a person’s imminent death, there is a chance today of saving lives by transplanting hearts, kidneys, livers etc. however, in the case of organs such as hearts and livers, transplantation can only take place if a patient’s need coincides with the death of a donor.
",
12056,1,," in the status quo, many people die as there is not a sufficient amount of organs that match the blood type and antibodies of the recipients.
",
12057,1,," if these are not matched then there is a chance of rejection of the organ.
",
12058,1,," live donations are growing becoming more common and often increase survival rates but this is only for cases where an organ can be donated with little risk of life such as with a kidney.
",
12059,1,," this proposal is much more extreme as it would allow parents instead of standing by watching their children die, unable to do anything to save them to take action.
",
12060,1,," the proposed motion would allow the relatives whose organs would save their loved one to donate their organ at the expense of their own life.
",
12061,1,," while this is an attractive idea to some, for others it violates the fundamental principles of how we are to relate to life.
",
12062,1,," it also touches upon the question of whether one can qualify and quantify human life.
",
12063,1,," regardless of which side might be found to be right, it is a motion that affects families at a pivotal point of their lives, but also health care professionals, religions, politicians and society as a whole.
",
12064,0,," we are biologically programmed to want to preserve our species .
",
12065,0,," as such , our offspring will often be more important to ourselves than our own persons .
",
12066,0,," many doctors hear parents tell them how they wish that they could `` take over '' their child 's terminal illness rather than have the child suffer .
",
12067,0,," it is therefore natural and right for the older generation to sacrifice itself where possible to save the younger generation .
",
12068,0,," as crass as this might seem , they are statistically more likely to die earlier than their offspring in any event and stand to lose less .
",
12069,0,," they have had the chance to experience more of a life than their child .
",
12070,0,," they are furthermore the cause of the child 's existence , and owe it to the child to protect it at any cost .
",
12071,0,," it is not fair to ask of a parent to live with the guilt of having been able to save their child and not doing so .
",
12072,0,," believing that they are guilty of their child 's death can cause post-traumatic stress syndrome , which in turn is a major cause of suicides .
",
12073,0,," it is a fundamental principle of the human being is that every human is born autonomous .
",
12074,0,," therefore , we believe that every person has a right to his or her own body and is thus competent to make decisions about it .
",
12075,0,," this is because we recognise that whatever decisions we might make about our bodies , stem from the knowledge that we have about our own preferences .
",
12076,0,," nobody can tell us how to value different goods and therefore what matters to one person might matter less to another .
",
12077,0,," if we were to undermine this right , nobody would be able to live their life to its fullest as they would be living their life to someone else 's fullest .
",
12078,0,," the extension of this right is that if someone values another person 's life over their own it is their informed decision to sacrifice themselves for that person .
",
12079,0,," it is not for others to decide , and in particular not for the state .
",
12080,0,," we have to be able to measure quality of life relatively .
",
12081,0,," there might be many cases where a relative is terminally ill , yet not dead yet .
",
12082,0,," this person , with a survival prospect of maybe half a year of suffering and medication , might have a perfectly functional organ .
",
12083,0,," it is very rational , both for this person and for society as a whole to allow him or her to undergo euthanasia at an early stage to save the other person .
",
12084,0,," furthermore , a person might sacrifice his or her life to provide an organ for a specific individual , yet their other organs can still be used to save others , of whom the donor might not have been aware .
",
12085,0,," it is sad that a person has to die , but as this is the only option , it is a good thing that several people might live when one sacrifices their life .
",
12086,0,," there is a clear need around the world for more donors of organs .
",
12087,0,," in the uk there are abouttransplants a year but there are always more waiting , in novemberthere werepeople waiting so on average each will be waiting for almost two years .
",
12088,0,," in germany there are over 12,000 waiting but onlydonations in.
",
12089,0,," the sacrifice of individual relatives who willingly choose death to save their loved ones therefore brings the need for donations into focus .
",
12090,0,," the media are likely to present heart-breaking stories about loving people who made the ultimate sacrifice .
",
12091,0,," as a consequence , more people will be aware of the issue and wish to fill in donor cards so that they might be able to minimise the number of voluntary donations in the event of their death .
",
12092,0,," thus there will be more naturally donated organs available and more lives will be saved .
",
12093,1,,"imagine that one day you come across five people in immediate and mortal peril.
",
12094,1,,"  you and you alone can save them, but doing so will kill one other person.
",
12095,1,,"  for instance, five people may be in path of an out-of-control trolley that could be diverted onto a track where there is only one person.
",
12096,1,,"  you are aware of no morally relevant differences between the six people: none of them are murderers or saints who especially “deserve” to live or die, and none of them ended up in this situation due to their own negligence or transgressions.
",
12097,1,,"  given such a situation (hereafter referred to as the “thought experiment”), the resolution is that you should opt to actively kill the one person in order to save the many.
",
12098,1,,"two terms are useful for understanding this debate.
",
12099,1,,"  “utilitarianism” is the ethical view that, broadly speaking, prescribes whatever course of action will result in the greatest good, usually measured by adding up the total amount of good (also known as “utility”, and which in practice usually means happiness or some other measure of a thriving life) that accrues to everyone.
",
12100,1,,"  according to utilitarianism, the correct act is that which results in the highest total utility, regardless of what actions it is that bring that state about; because of its emphasis on consequences, it is sometimes known as “consequentialism.”
",
12101,1,,"  according to utilitarianism, we generally ought not to kill, and ought to keep promises, because doing so makes everyone better off.
",
12102,1,,"  “deontology”, by contrast, is the ethical view that prescribes a moral agent to act in accordance with specific rules, regardless of their consequences.
",
12103,1,," deontology will, for instance, prescribe specific moral duties not to kill, and to always keep promises, not because of their results, but simply because we ought to do them.
",
12104,1,,"  deontological rules are often justified on the basis of treating each person as they deserve and respecting them not as a “mere means.”
",
12105,0,," we have good reasons to value keeping people alive : it allows people the opportunity to enjoy their time on earth and effect changes to everyone 's benefit , even if that simply means being around for our loved ones .
",
12106,0,," most people would even go so far as to say that , by virtue of being conscious creatures , human beings deserve to live .
",
12107,0,," that is to say , they have a right not to suffer an untimely death .
",
12108,0,," this is the reason that we normally abhor killing : it cuts short human life .
",
12109,0,," however , in this thought experiment , the inescapable reality is that someone 's right to life will be violated .
",
12110,0,," either the one or the five will die , and all the horrible results attached to the cessation of a human life will inevitably befall one of the groups .
",
12111,0,," in light of this fact , our moral obligation is to reduce the number of people whose right to life is violated and maximize the number for whom that right is actualized .
",
12112,0,," one ought to commit the act that results in the fewest deaths , and that is to kill the one and save the five .
",
12113,0,," every time a life is extinguished , some amount of present and future good vanishes from the world .
",
12114,0,," all the good things that that person would have experienced -- joy , accomplishment , delight -- will no longer occur .
",
12115,0,," similarly , all the beneficially effects they will have one other people , from productively working to loving their family , will also not occur .
",
12116,0,," true , people also experience unhappy times , and they sometimes negatively affect others , but in all but an exceptionally small number of cases , the net contribution of a human life to total utility is positive , indeed , if it were n't , we probably would n't consider death to be bad .
",
12117,0,," even though there will be some fluctuations in how much each life contributes to total utility -- a happy doctor probably adds more utility than a miserable meter maid -- it is overwhelmingly likely that saving the five lives will result in a situation of greater utility than preserving the life of the one .
",
12118,0,," while rawls did oppose utilitarianism , he generated a hypothetical scenario that is useful , even to the utilitarian , for evaluating moral theories .
",
12119,0,," imagine that all human beings were placed in a scenario where they knew nothing about their station in the world , and know only the basic laws of reasoning and human nature .
",
12120,0,," they do not know what their level of intelligence , personality traits , gender , socioeconomic status , race or religion will be , nor even when or where they will be born ; they are `` behind the veil of ignorance . ''
",
12121,0,," every single person who will ever exist is placed in this situation at the beginning of the universe .
",
12122,0,," next , these human beings are told they will decide which rules will govern human conduct when they come to inhabit the world .
",
12123,0,," in such a situation , all rational human beings would ensure that they are treated fairly no matter who they are ; they will have perfect sympathy for every human being ever , because they could end up being that person .
",
12124,0,," whatever rules they come up with in this situation are the rules that are ethically correct , because these rules will never treat anyone unfairly , as that would be an irrational move .
",
12125,0,," so how would people in this hypothetical treat the decision whether to kill one to save five ?
",
12126,0,," rational actors would agree on the rule to kill the one and save the five .
",
12127,0,," after all , any given person is five times as likely to end up as a member of the five rather than as the one .
",
12128,0,," thus , behind the veil of ignorance , the rational human being would proudly prescribe `` save the five and kill the one . ''
",
12129,1,,"the events of september 11thresulted in governments all over the world taking extraordinary measures to enhance the security of their citizens.
",
12130,1,," whether this was justified or not is yet another flashpoint in the age old battle of liberty versus security.
",
12131,1,,"in the us, new security measures included unparalleled airport checkpoint procedures, face recognition devices in public places, tracking, monitoring and identification through thumb printing of certain categories of visitors, random searches of internet content by intelligence officers, the ability to demand records on somebody from any business or organisation, the use of wiretaps and the ability to intercept and read email, and eavesdropping on conversations between a lawyer and their client.
",
12132,1,," the possible use of racial profiling to target “suspicious individuals” for more thorough searches and questioning is also being seriously discussed, although allegedly not in operation.
",
12133,1,," most of these measures are associated with loss of privacy; liberty has also been directly infringed through the detention without charge or trial of non-citizens, on the grounds they do not enjoy the same rights as citizens, the designation of us citizens as enemy combatants and their indefinite detention, and by trying suspects through military tribunals rather than in a normal court with judge and jury.
",
12134,1,,"on the one hand, extraordinary security measures are required to counteract the imminent threats of terrorism that has become much more cunning and resourceful over the last decade.
",
12135,1,," on the other hand, the introduction of these measures comes at the expense of sacrificing some of our most cherished civil liberties and rights as citizens.
",
12136,0,," no doubt, there is a trade-off between security and liberty, but what is the ideal balance between them?
",
12137,0,,"terrorism is part of the modern world and is inextricably linked with the rise of modern communications , the internet , and a global community .
",
12138,0,," this is an age in which space and time are bending to the tune of new media -- information at your fingertips may sound nice , but for those who want to destroy , it only makes their object easier to attain .
",
12139,0,," and so more strict national security measures must be employed in order to keep up with the enemy .
",
12140,0,," escalation is the name of the game imposed on governments around the world by terrorists for example the mumbai terrorists used gps systems to guide them into mumbai , attacks were coordinated on cell and satellite phones and blackberrys were used to monitor the international reaction .
",
12141,0,," in order to keep up states need new powers to stop , deter , and prevent terrorism .
",
12142,0,," the government needs to secure state-security first ; only then can the debate on civil liberties begin , and only then .
",
12143,0,," negative cases of security abuse are few and have been greatly exaggerated by an emphatic civil rights lobby that has no empathy for the victims of terrorism .
",
12144,0,," of course , with any wide-scale attempt to fight terrorism there are bound to be a few cases of abuse of security measures .
",
12145,0,," for example in the uk terrorism suspects were originally detained without charge under the anti-terrorism , crime and security act however the detention was declared unlawful by the law lords inso the government introduced new scaled back policies such as ` control orders ' .
",
12146,0,," therefore government has always been willing to scale back its security legislation when the courts believe it goes too far .
",
12147,0,," nonetheless it is not a good idea to shut down all security measures under a pretext that they violate rights .
",
12148,0,," the majority of the measures are intended to safeguard those civil liberties instead of abusing them .
",
12149,0,," the usa is at present far better than most countries in their respect and regard for civil liberties .
",
12150,0,," new security measures do not greatly compromise this liberty , and the us measures are at the very least comparable with similar measures already in effect in other democratic developed countries , e.g. spain and the uk , which have had to cope with domestic terrorism for far longer than the usa .
",
12151,0,," the facts speak for themselves -- the usa enjoys a healthy western-liberalism the likes of which most of the world 's people can not even conceive of .
",
12152,0,," the issue of the erosion of a few minor liberties of , states like the us 's , citizens should be overlooked in favour of the much greater issue of protecting the very existence of that state .
",
12153,0,," let us not forget that is with the consent of the public that these security measures are taken , cctv for example was a populist measure that has often been considered a threat to civil liberties .
",
12154,0,," it is in line with democratic ideals ; the majority of the country wants greater security .
",
12155,0,," for example in59 % of americans wanted the patriot act extended .
",
12156,0,," and because democracy embodies all those values we are fighting for -- freedom and equality included - we must adhere to a democratic spirit when deciding on how to organise ourselves or else risk falling into the same mind-set as those terrorists themselves .
",
12157,0,," it would be incredibly disingenuous of the opposition if they did not concede that the dangers are great and that something must be done .
",
12158,0,," because , deep down , everyone knows that it is simply a balancing of risks -- in practice all the government is trying to do is save lives .
",
12159,0,," it is of course , the government 's primary duty to protect citizens but this can only be done with the loss of some civil liberties .
",
12160,0,," these liberties will of course still be completely protected by the courts .
",
12161,0,," when it comes to the issue of life and death , it is the proposition 's hope that a few civil liberties would be only willingly given up by any prudent citizen .
",
12162,1,,"war is always evil, but some thinkers have maintained that under limited circumstances it may be the lesser evil.
",
12163,1,," from cicero to st augustine, thomas aquinas to hugo grotius, philosophers and theologians have proposed numerous criteria for determining if a war is just.
",
12164,1,," according to contemporary just war theory, a war is just only if it meets the six conditions presented in the following debate.
",
12165,1,," the theory is underwritten by the dual assumptions that the moral reality of war is not fixed by the actual activities of soldiers but by the opinions of mankind and that the truth is we want, even in war, to act or to seem to act morally.
",
12166,1,," it has been formulated to prevent war, not justify it; a nation must satisfy all six conditions or the war is not just.
",
12167,0,," the theory is designed to show states the rigorous criteria they must meet to justify the use of violence and prompt them to find other ways of resolving conflicts.
",
12168,0,,"wars are just if the cause is just .
",
12169,0,," nations should be allowed to defend themselves from aggression , just as individuals are permitted to defend themselves against violence .
",
12170,0,," in the un charter , signed in the wake of world war ii , article, paragraphaltogether prohibits the use or threat of force with only self-defence , as stated in article, permitted as a justification to the resort to arms .
",
12171,0,," the intentions behind the war must be good .
",
12172,0,," states have the right to use war to restore a just peace , to help the innocent , or to right a wrong .
",
12173,0,," for example , the us and nato were justified in using force in bosnia and kosovo .
",
12174,0,," waging war was far more ethical than standing by and permitting genocide and `` ethnic cleansing '' .
",
12175,0,," the war must be lawfully declared by a lawful authority .
",
12176,0,," this prevents inappropriate , terrorist-style chaos , and ensures that other rules of war will be observed .
",
12177,0,," for example , when states declare war , they generally follow specific legislative procedures ; a guaranteed respect for such procedures is likely to ensure that the nation will respect international humanitarian law , formally codified in the geneva conventions ofand updated in the additional protocols of.
",
12178,0,," war must be a last resort .
",
12179,0,," the state is justified in using armed force only after it has tried all non-violent alternatives .
",
12180,0,," sometimes peaceful measures -- diplomacy , economic sanctions , international pressure , or condemnation from other nations -- simply do not work , but they must at least be tried in order to give every chance for a peaceful resolution to a crisis .
",
12181,0,," the goal of the war should be proportional to the offense , and the benefits proportional to the costs .
",
12182,0,," for example , when an attacker violates a nation 's border , a proportionate response might extend to restoring the border , not sacking the attackers ' capital .
",
12183,0,," a war must prevent more suffering than it causes .
",
12184,0,," the coalition that formed under the aegis of the united nations to repel the iraqi invasion of kuwait fought a proportional conflict to the extent that they did not march on baghdad after they had pushed the iraqi army out of the occupied territory .
",
12185,0,," the war must have a reasonable chance of success .
",
12186,0,," war always involves a loss of life , but expending life with no possibility of achieving a goal is unacceptable .
",
12187,0,," thus , if a fighting force can not achieve its goal , however just , it should not proceed .
",
12188,0,," charging an enemy 's cannons on horseback or throwing troops at a pointless occupation are clearly not just actions .
",
12189,1,,"the issue of when a child is mature enough to consent to various decisions is a complicated one and this debate focusses on just one part; those decisions that relate to their medical well-being.
",
12190,1,," there are a number of areas where the consent of parents is required – surgery, transplants, blood transfusion and others where the child is not able to give consent because they are too young; circumcision being one obvious example.
",
12191,1,," many jurisdictions stress that the child should be involved wherever possible but, the decision lies with the parents, or in their absence, a court.
",
12192,1,,"put simply, the doctor is free to use their medical judgement in an emergency situation – an arrival in an emergency room or accident and emergency department but where there is time available to ask for consent it must be sought from both the young person and their parents.
",
12193,1,,"for example the general medical council in the uk sets out;in many case, parents are happy to take the advice of doctors for their children, just as they would for themselves.
",
12194,1,," however, and this is the focus of this debate, there are occasions where there is a conflict between the values or beliefs of the parent(s) and the general consensus of medical opinion.
",
12195,1,," the contention of some doctors is that it is unfair for the parents to make a decision, that could cost the child her life, and that she may not have taken that decision later in life.
",
12196,1,,"this is further complicated by the fact that many children, especially younger children, share the views of their parents, somewhat uncritically.
",
12197,1,," therefore, the doctor and the courts face the question of whether the doctor is able to overrule the opinions of both, let us say, a teenager and their parents.
",
12198,1,," this will focus on the issue of blood transfusion for teenage children of parents who are members of the jehovah’s witnesses (jws).
",
12199,1,,"the issue of whether the rejection of transfused blood is in and of itself sensible is irrelevant both legally and in this debate.
",
12200,1,,".
",
12201,1,,"  nobody disputes that the lack of medical action is a risk in medical terms – and one that may lead to death.
",
12202,1,," the issue for debate is whether the religious views of the parents or the medical opinion of the doctors should have primacy in determining the correct course of action.
",
12203,1,," the debate is about who should have the right to decide, not what that decision should be.
",
12204,1,," this is considered as an issue of conscience, the implications for the soul of the patient are not considered here.
",
12205,1,,"although this debate relates to blood transfusion and jws – we will assume that proposition have defined it as such – it’s principles would apply to other, similar, disputes such as whether parents have the right to reject organs from a person of another race or reject drugs that have been tested on animals.
",
12206,0,," asking doctors to take other considerations into account is not only a breach of their professional integrity , it also poses grave risks for society .
",
12207,0,," they are being asked , in this situation , to allow the opinions of a third party take precedence over the wellbeing of their patient .
",
12208,0,," if this were a younger relative with their eye on an inheritance or a distant sibling seeking to settle an old score , the dangers would be all too apparent .
",
12209,0,," in this instance , the motivation may be well-intentioned but it is no more reasonable .
",
12210,0,," allowing relatives to say `` well , what i think you should do is x '' in defiance of medical opinion is fraught with dangers .
",
12211,0,," if a relative decided on behalf of a patient to reject chemotherapy in favour of prayer or expressed their preference for shamanic rituals rather than medication , why not let them .
",
12212,0,," after all their intent is just as compassionate and their reasoning as solid .
",
12213,0,," we expect the legal and medical professions to accord particular protection to children against the actions of others that could harm them including , in extremis , their parents .
",
12214,0,," it is difficult to see what could be a more flagrant example of possible harm than allowing your child to die when an available remedy could save their life .
",
12215,0,," the protection of children is treated differently from how we address the needs of adults .
",
12216,0,," the very fact that their parents ' consent for procedures is required acknowledges that fact .
",
12217,0,," we further accept that when that consent is questionable - when the parents may not be acting in the best interests of the child - that right may be revoked .
",
12218,0,," in most instances of such revocation , if the parent is an addict or mentally incapable of a particular decision , such a decision can be determined well in advance .
",
12219,0,," however , in this instance , the status of the parent has not previously been an issue .
",
12220,0,," however , the same principles should surely apply .
",
12221,0,," for example , if a parent has been denied access rights to their child by a court , they would have no standing in making any such decision .
",
12222,0,," if their child is a ward of the court , the same would apply .
",
12223,0,," society has a general duty to at least keep children alive until they reach the age of majority and remove all possible obstacles to that happening .
",
12224,0,," we do not allow parents to give their children the right to pursue other harmful activities or to take unnecessary risks with their safety ; the principle of a presumption of protection would also apply here .
",
12225,1,,"the ideal of participatory democracy is to give ordinary citizens the possibility of participating in the public decision-making.
",
12226,1,," the very idea of democracy has changed significantly from the ancient greek direct democracies to the dominant form of liberal representative democracy existing today in most of the modern nation-states.
",
12227,1,," while in the ancient greek laws and important decisions were debated and voted on by an assembly comprising of every single citizen, the modern liberal democracies are based on the political representation and elites' competition.
",
12228,1,,"  ancient democracies were little city-states like athens that allowed only a few thousand of their people to be “citizens”, making it possible for the entire voting population to be gathered in one place while leaving the labour in the hands of the slaves and women and even for representatives to be elected on the basis of a lottery.
",
12229,1,," for modern nation-states with universal suffrage this is impractical.
",
12230,1,," modern democracies with mass electorates are all representative democracies in which elected politicians make decisions on behalf of the people, rather than the people making decisions directly.
",
12231,1,," although purely direct democracy may be impractical, there are several ways in which representative democracies can become much more participative.
",
12232,1,," in other words, there are several ways in which a more participatory approach of democracy can allow citizens to become direct contributors to the public decisions and improve the political representation in our liberal institutions.
",
12233,1,," several political participatory formulas already exist today.
",
12234,1,," some of them are already consolidated in current democracies, for example primary elections in political parties, limitation of mandates and rotation of public positions.
",
12235,1,," other examples are less common but growing, for figure constitutional or legislative refrenda, popular legislative initiative, or participatory budgeting.
",
12236,1,," california, for example, allows its citizen-initiated referenda: anyone can propose a new law, and if they can get enough signatures on a petition in support of it, the law is put directly to the people in a public vote.
",
12237,1,," another example is the right of recall: allowing citizens to force early elections if enough of them sign a petition saying they are unhappy with the current government (used in california and british columbia).
",
12238,1,," there are significant examples regarding participatory budgeting, such as porto alegre (brasil), where citizens are involved directly in the configuration of the public investments throughout territorial and sectorial meetings with experts, politicians, civil society organisations and individual citizens.
",
12239,1,," much greater participation is also increasingly possible as a result of online voting and discussion that avoids the problem of bringing millions of people to one place to make decisions.
",
12240,1,,"then, if we imagine a continuum between a complete direct democracy, where all the citizens participate in all public decisions, and a pure representative one, where the government of public affairs lies solely in the hands of political or representative elites, we can see that some kind of intermediate formulas might be discussed and applied in the existing democratic political communities.
",
12241,1,," we should understand democracy as a gradual process instead of a binary concept.
",
12242,1,," this means thinking of government as a phenomena that can be more or less democratic rather than only democratic or nondemocratic.
",
12243,1,," as a result we will see that participatory forms of government can improve both, the efficiency and the sustainability of our political institutions in the era of technological and educational revolution we live today.
",
12244,0,," representative democracy is oppressive because it takes more power away from the people than is strictly necessary .
",
12245,0,," whilst a completely direct democracy is impractical , we should nevertheless recognise that there is no reason not to have as much direct democracy as possible .
",
12246,0,," in the words of herbert marcuse , `` free election of masters does not abolish the masters or the slaves '' .
",
12247,0,," the key point is that merely holding an election every four years does not fundamentally alter our state of subservience : at election time , we are given a choice of three or four manifesto programmes on an all-or-nothing basis , manifestos which may never be honoured .
",
12248,0,," the only power over our government we as citizens have is the power to punish politicians retrospectively , by voting them out after years of obeying them .
",
12249,0,," it is quite possible to create an authoritarian system that has regular representative elections , even with several competitive candidates and yet still not be giving power to the people , as is shown by iran .
",
12250,0,," this is wrong .
",
12251,0,," the presumption should always be that the people keep as much power over their own lives and hand as little to their masters as possible because they never get to consent to the powers that rule them .
",
12252,0,," given that we are born under governments which exist whether we like it or not , it as an offense to our natural liberty and equality that those governments should hold any more power over us than is absolutely necessary .
",
12253,0,," besides , when the interests of the state are not the interests of the people , we have the government of the few over the rest .
",
12254,0,," representative democracy is less legitimate because it empowers unelected elites .
",
12255,0,," representative democracy is systematically biased against ordinary people , particularly poor people .
",
12256,0,," unelected elites like wealthy businessmen , trade union leaders , civil servants , party officials and media proprietors are able to bypass the democratic process and exert direct pressure on elected politicians .
",
12257,0,," this happens because decisions are made behind closed doors by individual politicians who can be easily bullied or bought out .
",
12258,0,," this allows elites to effectively wield public power even when they are not elected themselves .
",
12259,0,," if decisions were made more directly by the people there would be less scope for elites to manipulate the process by simply appealing to a politician 's self-interest .
",
12260,0,," elite influence is a systematic problem because it is self-reinforcing : elites lobby for laws to preserve their own power and disempower the public .
",
12261,0,," a good example of this is rupert murdoch 's behind-the-scenes lobbying for the repeal of regulations preventing him from dominating the media market .
",
12262,0,," considering that at any past time in the human history the conditions of equality in labour division , education and technological tools were not as favourable as nowadays in terms of allowing citizen political involvement , a more participatory political decision-making must be now taken into account .
",
12263,0,," a clear example is the iceland 's `` wiki constitution ''  .
",
12264,0,," then , although the classic criticism against direct democracy formulas based on the premise that size creates problrms -- referring to the difficulties to shape participatory citizen deliberation in our enormous current nation-states -- may still be true , cultural , social and technological conditions for participation have become much more favourable .
",
12265,0,," representative systems struggle to sustain popular trust , which is bad for democracy .
",
12266,0,," public trust in politics always tends to be dented by three specific features of representative systems .
",
12267,0,," firstly , the perception of elite influence over the political process is a largely unavoidable feature of electoral democracy because such elites are easily placed to manipulate politics , even if they do not actually do so .
",
12268,0,," secondly , the spotlight in representative democracy is on individual politicians , rather than on policies , and consequently exposing scandals and smearing the characters of politicians is an essential part of the political game : media coverage of politicians is largely hostile , particularly problematic if it diverts discussion from the merits and demerits of particular policies .
",
12269,0,," a third feature of the system is that , since public opinion has no direct power , unpopular decisions do n't have to be properly justified .
",
12270,0,," governments often defy public opinion when they think a policy will pay off in the long run , and often they do n't really bother explaining why they are doing so , a good example of this is gordon brown 's signing of the lisbon treaty in.
",
12271,0,," these three factors all tend to undermine trust in politics in representative systems .
",
12272,0,," trust is essential for democracy because without it people will not bother following politics or voting , leaving the door open for elites and aggressive minorities to wield undue influence .
",
12273,0,," a clear example of this phenomenon is in the united states , where christian fundamentalists -- despite being a minority -- wield enormous power .
",
12274,0,," the reason for this is that turnout in american elections is very low , whilst fundamentalist christians are politically very active and organised , allowing them huge influence .
",
12275,0,," giving people more responsibility for making political decisions is itself a good thing .
",
12276,0,," participating in political decision-making allows citizens to achieve a higher state of intellectual and moral maturity , letting them lead better and wiser lives .
",
12277,0,," since the difficult business of government forces them to learn how to make tough choices and compromise they will quickly abandon their simplistic prejudices and assumptions .
",
12278,0,," representative democracy is the opposite : it treats the public as if they are incapable of making important choices themselves , and thus denies most citizens a chance to meaningfully participate .
",
12279,0,," representative democracy often implies a mercantile vision of the political performance , where the politicians play the role of the sellers and the voters act as a simple buyers of political options .
",
12280,0,," this means that the vast majority of voters remain ignorant at best , and apathetic at worst .
",
12281,0,," this leaves them vulnerable to manipulation by deceitful politicians and political commentators .
",
12282,0,," furthermore , since many government decisions involve major moral dilemmas , citizens who participate in such decision-making will develop a more nuanced moral understanding and more thoughtful personal conduct .
",
12283,0,," thus , all democratic participation is beneficial .
",
12284,0,," participatory forms of democracy allows people to participate more than they otherwise would .
",
12285,0,," evidence for the impact of democratic participation is that radical and intolerant views are frequently expressed in young democracies but fade away as participation in democratic politics implants in the people respect for due process and different points of view .
",
12286,0,," a good example of this is that intolerant far-right parties are much more successful in the young democracies of eastern europe than the old democracies of western europe .
",
12287,0,," participatory democracy will lead to better decisions because laws will only be passed if they can be justified to the people .
",
12288,0,," professional politicians are disproportionately drawn from the privileged classes and are often ignorant of the effects their policies will have on ordinary people -- as are the civil servants who advise them .
",
12289,0,," moreover , professional politicians are susceptible to corruption , lobbying or bullying by powerful vested interests seeking to direct government policy away from the general interest represented by the vast majority of the individual citizens , who generally lack such a determinant influence over the decision-making .
",
12290,0,," participatory democracy will therefore make sure that the legislation that is passed will help the people as much as possible ; for example they will limit unecessary bureaucracy and make sure that policies are fair .
",
12291,0,," thus for example switzerland has passed with% of the vote in a referendum a proposal that prevents big payouts for managers known as ` golden handshakes ' and ` golden parachutes ' and shareholders will have a veto over saleries .
",
12292,1,,"the issue of big versus small government is a significant in the election campaigns of many countries – and has recently been the subject of many hysterical pronouncements in the us.
",
12293,1,," in reality no incoming government does that much to change the overall size of government as there are, in practice, only so many savings that can be made or new initiatives that can be launched within the confines of acceptable levels of taxation.
",
12294,1,,"this argument is a particularly interesting one to study in the us as it is so ripe for the pricking of illusions on both sides of the political divide.
",
12295,1,,"even arriving at a definition of what is meant by ‘the size of government’ is problematic.
",
12296,1,," as this debate will focus on the united states, it may be worth dealing with a few popular misconceptions before they take hold, although there is plenty of room to work around these, as will be demonstrated in the substantive material itself.
",
12297,1,,"partisans on both sides would find explanations for these figures, which, in reality, would have little to do with reality.
",
12298,1,," instead it should be noting that this debate has more to do with (in addition to sophistic rhetoric) the attitudes and intentions of the two great tribal herds of us politics than it does with anything else.
",
12299,1,," it is, ultimately, a debate about political philosophy rather than political economy.
",
12300,1,," the fact that the cost of government has increased under every single successive president is one universally ignored.
",
12301,1,," such counter-intuitive realities can be observed in a huge number of political situations; it really say anything surprising about politics but is a good reason to double check the facts relied on by participants in a debate.
",
12302,1,,"essentially the philosophical differences are these: those in favor of small government believe that individuals, their families and communities are better placed than the state to help themselves and those around.
",
12303,1,," by doing so, individuals learn valuable skills of self-reliance and self-respect.
",
12304,1,," by contrast those who favor government-led action tend to believe that society as a whole should take responsibility for ensuring a certain quality of living for all its members and that by ensuring that there is a safety net people are better able to overcome transient crises or social inequalities in order to become helpful members of society.
",
12305,1,,"the other key aspect of the debate is the role of taxation in society.
",
12306,1,," those in favor of small government tend to believe that reducing the overall tax burden will stimulate the economy as a whole, by promoting enterprise, investment and entrepreneurialism.
",
12307,1,," they say that this, in turn creates jobs and “wealth”.
",
12308,1,," small government conservatives generally abide by the mantra that individuals know how to spend their money better than the federal government does.
",
12309,1,,"those associated with a big government approach tend to favor the use of tax as a redistributive system arguing that by taking a small amount from those who can afford it (obviously one person’s ‘small’ is not that of another) the government can use it to improve services such as education across the board, to everyone’s benefit.
",
12310,0,," government , especially in a developed nation and even more so in the wealthiest nation in the world , should be able to ensure that children are not hungry , the mentally ill are not living on the streets , borders are policed , veterans do n't live in squalor , the population can read , crime is controlled , the elderly do n't freeze to death and a million other markers of a civilized society .
",
12311,0,," this is particularly true of children but most people need a helping hand at one time or another in life .
",
12312,0,," however , the obscenity of children destined to fail before their lives have even started - condemned to schools that offer no hope and communities that offer no safety - would be disturbing anywhere in the world .
",
12313,0,," all of the indicators mentioned above have been adversely affect during the thirty year obsession with pushing the government back in the name of handing unfettered control over to big business and the vicissitudes of the market .
",
12314,0,," nobody would deny the role that remarkable individuals have played in the major social changes of history .
",
12315,0,," they have , however , ultimately required the actions of government .
",
12316,0,," many of these have been achieved despite , rather than because of , the interests of business .
",
12317,0,," critically they have tended to be to the benefit of the weak , the vulnerable and the neglected .
",
12318,0,," governments have been responsible for social reforms ranging from the abolition of slavery and child labor to the removal of conditions in factories and on farms that lead to injury and death , in addition to minimum wage regulations that meant that families could feed themselves .
",
12319,0,," by contrast , the market was quite happy with cheap cotton sown by nimble young fingers .
",
12320,0,," in turn profit was given preference over any notion of job security or the right to a family life , the market was quite happy to see water poisoned and the air polluted -- and in many cases is still happy with it .
",
12321,0,," the logic of the market panders to slave-labor wages to migrant workers or exporting jobs where migrants are not available .
",
12322,0,," either way it costs the jobs of american citizens , pandering to racism and impoverishing workers at home and abroad .
",
12323,0,," although the prophets of the market suggest that the only thing standing between the average american and a suburban home - with a pool , 4x4 and an overflowing college-fund is the government , the reality could not be further from the truth .
",
12324,0,," the simple reality of the market is this : the profit motive that drives the system is the difference between the price of labor , plant and materials on one hand and the price that can be charged on the other .
",
12325,0,," it makes sense to find the workers who demand the lowest wages , suppliers who can provide the cheapest materials and communities desperate enough to sell their air , water and family time .
",
12326,0,," whether those are at home or abroad .
",
12327,0,," the market , by its nature has no compassion , no patriotism and no loyalty .
",
12328,0,," the only organization that can act as a restraint on that is , in the final reckoning , government which has legislative power to ensure that standards are maintained .
",
12329,0,," it is easy to point to individual acts that have been beneficial but the reality is that the untrammeled market without government oversight has had a depressing tendency to chase the easiest buck , ditch the weakest , exploit where it can , pollute at will , corrupt where necessary and bend , break or ignore the rules .
",
12330,0,," it requires government as the agent of what the people consider acceptable to constrain the profit motive .
",
12331,0,," government expenditure is the single biggest tool in times of economic difficulty .
",
12332,0,," those that are the quickest to complain about taxation and regulation during the good times are also the fastest to rush for a bailout during the lean times .
",
12333,0,," likewise , those that call for tax cuts in a boom also tend to be the first to criticize a deficit or public expenditure during a recession .
",
12334,0,," there is in all of this one simple economic reality : the government acts as the banker of last resort .
",
12335,0,," this only works , as keynes understood , if the government holds on to reserves in the good years so that it can spend them in the tough ones to stimulate jobs and growth .
",
12336,0,," on the other hand , where surpluses are blown on tax cuts - or expensive wars for that matter - then will be nothing left in the bank and government can not fulfill its most useful role of using its own financial clout to balance the economy over the course of a financial cycle .
",
12337,0,," so-called small government conservatives have been consistently profligate in recent history and have tended to leave fiscally cautious liberals to pick up the pieces .
",
12338,0,," the party of small government never seems to find itself short of billions of dollars for expensive white elephants like the sdi missile shield or asserting american military power overseas in pursuit of yet another doomed cause -- whether that 's ' propping up latin american dictators or settling familial grudge matches in the middle east .
",
12339,0,," the military adventurism of the reagan presidency as well as those of both bush senior and junior were conducted not just at the cost of domestic social stability , but also fiscal security .
",
12340,0,," instead of preserving a budget surplus from the clinton presidency , the bush administration spent it recklessly -- not , as is widely declared , on the war against terror -- on tax cuts for the wealthiest in society .
",
12341,0,," as a result bush , his cabinet and his backers robbed the country of the possibility of reserves when the economy was in a less positive situation .
",
12342,0,," so called ` big government ' , withholding surpluses for a rainy day , provides financial security for american businesses and workers .
",
12343,0,," so-called ` small-government ' presidents spend trillions of dollars on free money to the super-rich and on military adventurism in other countries and , apparently , in space .
",
12344,1,,"even starting at the extreme of murder, it’s surprisingly difficult to demonstrate why it is immoral without coming to the conclusion that it’s mainly a crime because it denies the victim choice.
",
12345,1,," so where a person chooses to die is there even a moral issue at all, let alone a legal one?
",
12346,1,,"at one extreme, there’s the issue of turning off the life-support machine of a patient in a permanent vegetative state, at the other giving assistance to an otherwise healthy individual who simply no longer wants to live.
",
12347,1,," of course there’s then a step beyond that where no assistance is required and the individual commits suicide themselves, what should their family’s and wider society’s response to that be?
",
12348,1,,"the issue of the right to life is one that exercises many commentators and furious legislative debate.
",
12349,1,," the right to die – and our wider relationship to death – is one that has tended to receive less attention and, when it has done so, the debate has tended to be conducted in muted tones with very few hard and fast moral principles to cling onto.
",
12350,1,," in part, this is, perhaps, inevitable.
",
12351,1,," as a species the desire to live is hard wired into our dna and it is difficult to conceive that, for some, they may have reached an entirely rational and reasonable decision that they have finished with life.
",
12352,1,," it is much easier to conjure the image of a baby and make the case that it should not be denied its potential than it is to face a grown adult who is in obvious pain and tell them that they just have to put up with it.
",
12353,1,,"debaters’ noteclearly this debate covers an enormous number of topics; political, legal, philosophical, ethical, medical and others.
",
12354,1,," from the point of view of proposition, it is important to nail down a tight definition.
",
12355,1,," it’s important to give the parameters in which the right to die would apply otherwise opposition can easily portray the situation of people wandering into emergency rooms and asking to end it all because they’ve had a bad day.
",
12356,1,," does the right to die exist only in the case of a terminal medical condition?
",
12357,1,," is old age a sufficient justification?
",
12358,1,," are psychological and medical examinations of the individual required?
",
12359,1,," what protection is there from relatives killing off their relations and then insisting that it was suicide?
",
12360,1,," if ever there was a debate in which prop needs to give a clear overview of how the process would work, then this is it.
",
12361,1,," they should aim to set out a process in which it has been demonstrated that the potential suicide is in full control of her own mental faculties and has not been placed under pressure by others to end her life.
",
12362,1,," even with these secured opposition may argue, as some ethicists have, that the decision to commit suicide is, itself, prima fasciae evidence of a disturbed mind.
",
12363,1,," prop would also do well to place the debate over assisted suicide in countries where regular suicide is already legal – it’s simply an easier case to argue.
",
12364,0,," neither of these issues arise with either assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia .
",
12365,0,," proposition has no difficulty at all with the suggestion that both procedures should be regulated and take place in safe , medically supported , environments .
",
12366,0,," however , if an individual accepts that death is their preferred option in such a scenario , it is difficult to comprehend of reasons why they should not be allowed to proceed .
",
12367,0,," our social rejection of murder does not , ultimately relate to death itself but to the denial of choice .
",
12368,0,," with murder someone is denying that person all their future potential so denying their freedom of choice , and this remains the case even if the murder was completely painless .
",
12369,0,," here , reason tells us , the virtuous act is death and the reservation of that choice .
",
12370,0,," the determining element of humanity is that we are rational beings ; a blanket ban -- legal and social -- on choosing the time and manner of our deaths reflects our primeval fear of a death that comes , unwanted , in the dark of the night , not the mature judgement of modern , thinking , and long-lived , humans .
",
12371,0,," let us consider the example of the cancer patient who opts not to put herself through the agony and uncertainty of chemotherapy .
",
12372,0,," in such a circumstance , we accept that a person may accept the certainty of death with grace and reason rather than chasing after a slim probability of living longer but in pain .
",
12373,0,," all proposition is arguing is that this approach can also apply to other conditions , which may not be terminal in the strict sense of the world but certainly lead to the death of that person in any meaningful sense .
",
12374,0,," the application of medical science to extend a life , long after life is ` worth living ' or would be possible to live without these interventions can not be considered a moral good for its own sake .
",
12375,0,," many find that they are facing the prospect of living out the rest of their days in physical pain or are losing their memory .
",
12376,0,," as a result , some may see ` going out at the top of their game ' as the better , and more natural , option .
",
12377,0,," ultimately , the decision to die is a personal one , it may affect others but , clearly it has the greatest impact on the person who decides to die .
",
12378,0,," clearly those who remain behind will have to deal with the consequences of that death and the end of their relationship with that person but , one would hope , that would be the case if she had died of natural causes at a later date .
",
12379,0,," furthermore the experience of watching someone die can by as traumatic , or more so , for the carer or loved one than it is for the individual concerned .
",
12380,0,," what it clearly is not , is an issue for legislators and other strangers who have no connection to the person involved .
",
12381,0,," there are deeply personal issues such as love , death , sex , and reproduction where we accept the state may have a role in the formal sense of preventing their abuse but otherwise should not have an opinion either way .
",
12382,0,," with the right to die the state has maintained not only an opinion but a criminal sanction .
",
12383,0,," this is a clear example of where the role of the state is to respect the individual and step back ; legislation is far too cumbersome a tool with be used in circumstances as varied and complex as these .
",
12384,0,," dealing with the loss of a loved one , particularly in a situation such as assisted suicide , is painful and traumatic enough for all concerned without adding to that the additional stress of a threat of criminal sanction .
",
12385,1,,"tactical note: one of the difficulties with any debate relating to ideology is that, to put it mildly, they raise definitional problems.
",
12386,1,," capitalism is relatively easy although certainly smith would be unlikely to recognise the actions of the red in tooth and claw capitalists of modern banking.
",
12387,1,," however, that is beside the point.
",
12388,1,," socialism is even more difficult to define as it tends to be used in both positive and pejorative terms.
",
12389,1,," the added difficulty is that there is a world of difference between the steady social justice of scandinavia and the ramblings of the regime in north korea and yet both lay claim to the word.
",
12390,1,,"as a result it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate in to prop rambling on aboutand op extolling the virtues of paternity leave in sweden.
",
12391,1,," neither approach gets very far.
",
12392,1,," socialism is ultimately about economics, social justice and the distribution of wealth.
",
12393,1,,"the death of socialism has been declared in many ways and usually by people who don’t understand what it means.
",
12394,1,," however there is little doubt that the global left looks very different now from how it appeared in a pre-reagan/thatcher era, or for that matter pre-clinton.
",
12395,1,," certainly in the anglo-saxon world clinton and blair shifted massively on the issue of using taxation as a method of redistribution of wealth, and that is a trend that appears to be continuing under their successors.
",
12396,1,,"writers and intellectuals have spent much of the last two decades either bemoaning or relishing the demise of the organised left although they tend to overlook certain things.
",
12397,1,," primarily, if one were to sit down with morris or orwell and describe the world in 2012-especially the west-they would be staggered at the progress that had been made in terms of promoting the rights of the individual against those of a capitalist elite.
",
12398,1,," many of these battles were won directly because of the actions of socialists and others as a result of a changing dialectic they inspired.
",
12399,1,," since those results remain – universal suffrage, the abolition of child labour, the establishment of socialised medicine and universal education, in europe at least – does that mean that socialism is alive and well?
",
12400,1,,"alternatively, one can argue that for the most part the socialist parties of europe have hung up their red flags, gone back to their ideological drawing boards and returned with something that looks very much like market capitalism but with a few of the sharper edges smoothed off and painted a nicer colour.
",
12401,1,," increasingly, those who even use the word in european discourse tend to look either desperately out of date or terribly, terribly isolated.
",
12402,1,,"realistically this debate is not focussed anywhere near america, where (whatever newt gingrich may think) socialism never even got started.
",
12403,1,," it is also hard to set in asia where entirely different political traditions produced a range of comparable conclusions – but that confuses things.
",
12404,0,,"the “occupy” protests that came to prominence ingive an interesting perspective on proceedings and raises an interesting question: can any of the protests – be that the occupy movements or the more sporadic anti-austerity protests, be meaningfully described as socialist?
",
12405,0,,"there is clearly a difference between the general malaise of those protesting the result of the financial crisis and any form of coherent ideology or manifesto for government .
",
12406,0,," the only people pretending that protesters in athens or rome -- or the occupy movement worldwide -- are in some meaningful way socialists are aging class warriors from the seventies .
",
12407,0,," the world has moved on ; it is inconceivable that the protests of the seventies and eighties could be refought again .
",
12408,0,," this issue was settled at the end of the eighties .
",
12409,0,," it was n't just the collapse of the soviet union , although that no doubt played a major role in shaping the future of socialism in europe .
",
12410,0,," in a globalised world the traditional ideas about class and the nature of the labour market have moved on and politics moved on with it .
",
12411,0,," socialists may have won many of the arguments over social issues , but arguments on the advantages of free trade , deregulation , the role of the state , the relationship between government and industry all line up firmly in the capitalist column .
",
12412,0,," even the leaders of those european political parties that still call themselves socialist tend to avoid the word .
",
12413,0,," broadly speaking even the leaders of the left - outside cuba and colombia - accept the basic principles of market economics and recognise that high-tax , high-spend economics simply does not work .
",
12414,0,," like it or not borders are now open and the idea that the state can control the flow of capital is a thing of the past .
",
12415,0,," as a result people generally are richer and the idea that there a solid class block is simply no longer relevant to their lives .
",
12416,0,," global economic forces have rendered socialism powerless .
",
12417,0,," financial speculation , and investment flows can make or break economies , and the agents who channel these monies want to see countries liberalise , privatise and de-regulate more .
",
12418,0,," this is being shown by the speculative attacks on eurozone countries where the markets are showing they can force governments to implement tough austerity or even force changes in government without an election as has happened in greece and italy where technocrats have taken over as heads of government .
",
12419,0,," these more flexible markets generate higher levels of growth and prosperity , and provide higher returns on investment , encouraging more .
",
12420,0,," countries which try to resist globalisation and liberal economic markets , as in ` old europe ' , suffer stagnant growth and higher unemployment as a result .
",
12421,0,," old socialist-style economic models of tight economic regulation and central planning are unsustainable .
",
12422,0,," a planned economy requires that the planners have the information necessary to allocate resources in the right way .
",
12423,0,," this is a virtually impossible task .
",
12424,0,," the world contains trillions of different resources : my labour , iron ore , hong kong harbour , pine trees , satellites , car factories -- etc, the number of different ways to use , combine and recombine these resources is unimaginably vast .
",
12425,0,," and almost all of them are useless .
",
12426,0,," for example , it would be a mistake to combine arnold schwarzenegger with medical equipment and have him perform brain surgery .
",
12427,0,," centralised planning can not possibly sort through the myriad of way of arranging resources to arrive at the most efficient usage .
",
12428,0,," only a decentralised price system can achieve this via the institution of private property and associated duties and rights .
",
12429,1,,"freedom of speech is often considered to be one of the most basic tenets of democracy.
",
12430,1,," as a fundamental right it is enshrined in documents such as the bill of rights in the united states, the united nations declaration of human rights, and the european convention on human rights: congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
",
12431,1,," everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
",
12432,1,,"united nations general assembly resolutiona (iii) ofdecember 1948:article 19: everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
",
12433,1,,"this is expanded on in articleof the european convention on human rights(1.)
",
12434,1,," everyone has the right to freedom of expression.
",
12435,1,," this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.
",
12436,1,," this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
",
12437,1,,"(2.)
",
12438,1,," the exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or the rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
",
12439,1,,"freedom of speech and censorship are often phrased as opposite sides of a continuum that balance personal freedom with societal duty.
",
12440,1,," famous as a battle-ground between left and right in the united states, the united kingdom and elsewhere, issues of free speech are often championed by human rights organisations around the world seeking to support those fighting against repressive regimes (examples include aung san suu kyi, vaclav havel, and lech walesa).
",
12441,1,," the pentagon papers (1971) in the united states were the collected criticisms of the united states strategy during the vietnam war.
",
12442,1,," distributed widely to newspapers, they were published despite attempts by the government to suppress their publication.
",
12443,1,,"galileo's dialogue concerning the two chief world systems, ptolemaic & copernican was prohibited by the catholic church untilcontaining, as it did, the heretical doctrine that the earth rotated about the sun.
",
12444,1,," other books of note which have been banned include voltaire’s candide (us 1930), thomas paine’s rights of man (uk 1792), jack london’s call of the wild (italy 1929), anna sewell’s black beauty (south africa 1955), e for ecstasy (australia 1994), ernst zündel’s did six million really die?

12446,1,," inin the state of tennessee usa, john scopes was convicted for teaching darwin’s origin of species.
",
12447,1,,"  john locke's philosophical essay concerning human understanding was expressly forbidden to be taught at oxford university in 1701.
",
12448,1,,"the issue is one of much contemporary interest in the developed world, where new technologies have opened up unprecedented access to materials which governments could previously keep censored in a relatively efficient way – pornography, bomb manufacturing instructions etc. have become available on the world-wide web.
",
12449,1,," in general, however, the issue tends to fall into categories of book censorship, speech censorship, video censorship, newspaper censorship, and political expression of one description or another.
",
12450,0,," `` the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic . ''
",
12451,0,," shouting fire in a crowded cinema when there is no fire , and you know it , is wrong because doing so creates a clear and present danger of harm to others .
",
12452,0,," likewise , in the us , and many other countries , there is no protection for ` false commercial speech ' , i.e. misrepresentation , and the contents of adverts can be regulated in order to ensure that they are truthful and do not deceive consumers .
",
12453,0,," on that basis , restrictions can be placed on how tobacco products may be advertised , and people may be prevented from promoting illegal and fraudulent tax advice .
",
12454,0,," we need to protect minors , those under the age of majority , from exposure to obscene , offensive or potentially damaging materials .
",
12455,0,," while this would be a restriction on the freedom of speech it should be something that the government is responsible for and we would all agree needs some kind of restriction or regulation .
",
12456,0,," the government must protect its citizens from foreign enemies and internal enemies - thus freedom of speech can be acceptably curtailed during times of war in order to prevent propaganda and spying which might undermine the national interest .
",
12457,0,," this has happened in almost all states during times of war , during the second world war the united states even had a government department dedicated to it ; the office of censorship .
",
12458,0,," speech acts lead to physical acts .
",
12459,0,," thus pornography , hate speech and political polemic are causally linked to rape , hate crimes , and insurrection .
",
12460,0,," both scientific creationism and holocaust denial have serious , and dangerous , hidden agendas .
",
12461,0,," deniers of the nanjing massacre believe that the japanese did nothing wrong in the second world war and continue to claim that it was a war of liberation against western colonialism - feeding japanese militarism today .
",
12462,0,," holocaust deniers , in claiming that a jewish conspiracy is responsible for the widespread belief that six million jews were murdered by the nazis , are closely allied to anti-semitism and neo-nazism .
",
12463,0,," we should not allow such views the legitimacy which being debated gives them .
",
12464,1,,"the abolishment of nuclear weapons would constitute the complete and multi-lateral disarmament of all current nuclear weapons and material earmarked specifically for their development or production.
",
12465,1,,"nuclear weapons first dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945, forever changed the face of war, and the half-century of cold war which followed was dominated, above all, by the threat of nuclear destruction.
",
12466,1,," both superpowers raced to produce a greater arsenal than their opponents, leading to the point where they had the ability to destroy the world several times over.
",
12467,1,," added to the direct destructive power of the weapons was the consensus growing among scientists from 1970s onwards that a major war would plunge the world into a ‘nuclear winter’, destroying life even in places that had escaped attack.
",
12468,1,," this led to the concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’, a stalemate in which both sides knew that the use of their weapons would lead to their own destruction as well as their enemies.
",
12469,1,," the global situation has, however, changed substantially since the end of the cold war.
",
12470,1,," nuclear weapons have ceased to dominate world politics; however, the fear of proliferation – the spread of weapons of mass destruction to many more countries – is also on the rise.
",
12471,1,," india, pakistan, israel and north korea are all now believed to be nuclear powers, and many fear that iran will soon join them.
",
12472,1,," proponents focus on the total abolition of the world’s nuclear arsenals as a realistic and necessary goal to aim for.
",
12473,1,," it will take time, as president obama has recently argued “i'm not naive.
",
12474,1,," this goal will not be reached quickly –- perhaps not in my lifetime.”
",
12475,1,," the opposition is more pragmatic, not defending the weapons per se but insisting that they remain a necessary means to a peaceful end.
",
12476,1,,"president obama has moved the idea of nuclear disarmament up the international agenda.
",
12477,1,," in prague inhe stated “so today, i state clearly and with conviction america's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.”
",
12478,1,," obama followed up with a nuclear security summit which sought to safeguard nuclear materials but did not much advance any attempt to abolish nuclear weapons.
",
12479,0,," nuclear weapons are , by their very nature , indiscriminate and disproportional ; any weapon which could not possibly be used in a responsible manner should not be permitted .
",
12480,0,," over the past fifty years , we have seen a general tendency towards limited warfare and precision weapons , allowing military objectives to be achieved with minimal loss of civilian life .
",
12481,0,," the entire point of nuclear weapons , however , is their massive , indiscriminate destructive power .
",
12482,0,," their use could kill tens of thousands of civilians directly , and their catastrophic environmental after-effects would harm many more all around the world .
",
12483,0,," these effects could never be morally acceptable , particularly as the basis of one 's national security strategy .
",
12484,0,," they place ` humanity and most forms of life in jeopardy of annihilation ' , krieger  .
",
12485,0,," no state or leader can be entrusted , morally , with a power and responsibility that could come close to annihilating humanity .
",
12486,0,," by claiming the efficacy of nuclear weapons as a strategic deterrent , the current nuclear powers encourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , krieger  .
",
12487,0,," to be a part of the so-called ` nuclear club ' is seen as a matter of great prestige ; when india and pakistan recently declared their nuclear capability and held mutual tests in the 1990s , it was seen in both countries as increasing their international status .
",
12488,0,," nevertheless , tensions in the region have only increased since the mutual announcements , not least the kargil war ofthat almost precipitated a nuclear war .
",
12489,0,," nations opposed to a nuclear power therefore feel that they need to develop their own capability in order to protect themselves .
",
12490,0,," the declared nuclear powers must therefore take the lead in disarmament , as an example for the rest of the world .
",
12491,0,," while nuclear weapons exist , they can fall into the wrong hands .
",
12492,0,," this is particularly prevalent in an environment whereby there are extremist groups actively seeking to cause instant , egregious harm to their ideological and political enemies .
",
12493,0,," such groups do not lack for funding ; therefore the fear of weapons falling into the wrong hands has never been higher .
",
12494,0,," this is particularly true in russia , which now has control of all of the nuclear weapons which were distributed around the former soviet union .
",
12495,0,," in particular during the 1990s the military was disastrously underfunded ; technicians and officers who were used to a high standard of living found themselves without pay , sometimes for years .
",
12496,0,," at the same time , other states and extremist groups are willing to pay substantial sums for their services , and to gain access to nuclear weapons .
",
12497,0,," this same danger is now as much , if not more , of a problem in pakistan , ambinder  .
",
12498,0,," the danger of a weapon being stolen , or a nuclear base being taken over by disgruntled members of the military or other extremists , can only be ended by destroying the weapons , allison  .
",
12499,0,," the disproportionate and indiscriminate nature of nuclear weapons use renders their possession illegal under international humanitarian law .
",
12500,0,," the international court of justice in, asked to provide an advisory opinion , declared unanimously that any use or threat of nuclear weapons had to be compatible with existing international law relating to armed conflict , international court of justice  .
",
12501,0,," the principles of discrimination and proportionality inherent in the laws of wars are codified in the geneva conventions of, and are quite clearly violated by nuclear weapons .
",
12502,0,," as such , a majority of the judges present felt that any such use or threat would ` generally be contrary ' to those rules of international law and therefore , unanimously , ` there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control ' , international court of justice  .
",
12503,0,," the co-operation of the united states and russia , demonstrated in their regularly-renewed start treaties , confer the ability of nuclear powers to work towards a reduction in nuclear stockpiles .
",
12504,0,," a new campaigning body , global zero , has laid out the path to nuclear abolishment , concerning first bilateral accords to reduce stockpiles in the manner already occurring .
",
12505,0,," from there , they advocate the ` universal acceptance of a comprehensive verification and enforcement system accompanied by tighter controls on fissile materials produced by civil-nuclear programmes ' , the economist  .
",
12506,0,," the process will not be swift , but it is plausible and not a stretch considering the success of previous start treaties and the example of the international atomic energy agency as an independent body charged with verifying nuclear installations .
",
12507,1,,"cluster bombs are weapons that were first developed by the germans for use in world warand are weapons that have seen continued use in subsequent conflicts such as vietnam and the first gulf war.
",
12508,1,," cluster bombs are usually dropped from planes, when they hit the ground the impact causes the bomb to explode and release several smaller bombs (or “bomblets”) that then go on to explode as well, dealing damage in a much wider radius than an average bomb.
",
12509,1,," due to the large number of small bombs that are released on impact, cluster bombs are prone to causing significant collateral damage and often harm civilians, either on impact or because many of the smaller bombs fail to explode and do so later when uncovered by civilians who do not know about the dangers.
",
12510,1,,"while there have been no international trials specifically about the use of cluster munitions one of the crimes for which milan martic was convicted inby the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty) was the use of an m-87 orkan rocket which containspellets.
",
12511,1,," the icty considered this to be an “indiscriminate weapon” which was being used in “densely populated civilian areas, such as zagreb, will result in the infliction of sever casualties.”
",
12512,1,," so convicted martic for attacks on civilians and inhumane acts – both crimes against humanity.
",
12513,1,,"currently, eighty-four countries have ratified the convention on cluster munitions banning the use of cluster weaponry in warfare (as well as stockpiling, production and transfer of the munition), claiming their indiscriminate nature makes them similar to land mines in this regard.
",
12514,1,," a furtherhave signed the treaty but not ratified.
",
12515,1,," however, other nations such as the united states have failed to join this treaty, claiming that cluster bombs are needed for modern warfare strategies.
",
12516,1,,"the proponents of cluster bombs argue that the collateral damage they cause is outweighed by the lives that are saved because the side using them is able to bring a war to a speedy conclusion.
",
12517,1,,"from a debate perspective, the motion can be set in a general context, not specifying the u.s. however, without arguments based around opinions of the u.s. internationally the debate lacks the content to go down an eight speech table.
",
12518,0,," in a modern warfare scenario , the vast majority of combat takes place in civilian areas , such as cities .
",
12519,0,," whilst cluster bombs are obviously not used for peacekeeping purposes they are used in initial assaults on these areas , particularly against larger formations of enemy troops .
",
12520,0,," this means that due to the indiscriminate nature of cluster bombs , in the same way as with land mines , often both military and civilian targets are encompassed in the blast radius .
",
12521,0,," this is what happened in zagreb as martic was targeting croat forces but the attack due to the use of cluster weapons also killed civilians .
",
12522,0,," further , cluster bombs often have a few bomblets which are duds and do not go on initial impact .
",
12523,0,," the issue with bomblets is that they are often brightly coloured and when used in cities or populous areas they can often attract the attention of children who are very unlikely to know to be careful around them .
",
12524,0,," this can result in significant harm to civilian populations well after the attack has been carried out .
",
12525,0,," further , due to the sheer volume of duds that cluster bombs put out , attempts to demine cluster bomb bomblets is an incredibly dangerous process that in of itself costs lives .1,2,3 the international legal system is dependent on being robust and transparent in order for it to be respected by countries and states that accept it .
",
12526,0,," the refusal by the u.s. to ban cluster bombs prevents the international community from doing the same within international law as the u.s. has enough political power that should it choose to ignore the law , the law itself is considered to be irrelevant .
",
12527,0,," in failing to ban cluster bombs the u.s. maintains an inconsistency within international law .
",
12528,0,," since dud cluster bombs effectively act as land mines for all intents and purposes , they are well hidden and cause indiscriminate damage , the fact that they are n't banned is inconsistent with existing bans on land mines already .
",
12529,0,," this inconsistency within international law makes the international legal system seem less credible , owing to contradictions as well as illustrating its weakness to the influence of the u.s, this makes it more difficult for countries to enforce the rules of the international legal system , such as preventing human rights violations because fewer countries will accept international law as being legitimate and will not agree to subject themselves to those rules .5 the u.s. is one of the only remaining western liberal democracies to allow the u.s. of cluster bombs .
",
12530,0,," the continued refusal of the u.s. to tow the same line as fellow liberal democracies makes it look bad internationally ; especially considering that one of the main instigators behind the cluster bomb ban is the u.k. traditionally a great ally of the u.s. politically .
",
12531,0,," the u.s. is often seen as the greatest representative of western liberal democracy as it is the most economically powerful .
",
12532,0,," part of this political clout however , comes from the continued cooperation of other western liberal democracies with the u.s. in failing to the sign the cluster bomb treaty despite pressure from other countries , the u.s. fails in this capacity and loses the support of the countries that it relies on to maintain its political status .
",
12533,0,," moreover , given that the u.s. currently does not help with demining work , this further worsens relationships with other countries .6
",
12534,1,,"in recent years, there has been much discussion regarding the concept of a european defence force (sometimes referred to as the “euro corps” or edf).
",
12535,1,," such a standing armed force would be drawn from eu member-nations and operate under eu control, in contrast to the existing nato grouping which has the united states as a prominent and influential member.
",
12536,1,," as is often the case with matters of national and regional defence, there is much controversy as to whether the european defence force is a good idea.
",
12537,0,," debates on the euro corps can often revolve around the proposed role of nato in the post-cold war era, and it is important to realise that the significance of the edf may resonate beyond the borders of the european union.
",
12538,0,,"it is important for the eu to have a defence policy independent of nato .
",
12539,0,," with its origins in the cold war , and its preponderance of american influence , nato carries a great deal of historical and geopolitical baggage .
",
12540,0,," this means that nato can not easily intervene in eastern europe without incurring the displeasure of russia .
",
12541,0,," this was best proven during theconflict between russia and georgia , when georgia 's impending accession to nato was seen as part of the incentive for russian support to the ` break-away ' regions in georgia .
",
12542,0,," the european defence force will allow the eu to deal with crises in eastern and central europe more effectively , as they will not have to tiptoe around russia as much .
",
12543,0,," the european union has significant integration and convergence of the political and economic spheres .
",
12544,0,," integration of defence policy and the establishment of a european defence force should be the logical next step .
",
12545,0,," the african union took this step and has achieved success in combat missions defending the union .
",
12546,0,," nato has been crucial to maintaining the balance of power during the cold war .
",
12547,0,," although there have been some arguments amongst its member states , nato has shown us that a standing multinational defence force is possible and more importantly works well overall .
",
12548,0,," the recent nato deployment in libya is an example of its regional influence and military flexibility .
",
12549,0,," considering many members of nato are also members of the eu , the proposed european defence force could follow its example and complement it .
",
12550,0,," with the growing industrial and economic maturity of the european union and its members , it is now financially feasible for the eu to have its own standing defence force .
",
12551,0,," the proposed edf would also create a great many jobs as european defence contractors could be recruited into supplying equipment and weaponry .
",
12552,0,," constant political instability and war in and near the middle east call for a united single force charged with the defence of eu countries lying close to the volatile areas , turkey is a prime candidate for eu membership , and with its location on the border of both syria and iraq , will require support if its refugee problem is to remain manageable .
",
12553,0,," the revolutions in northern africa also call for a stabilising force in the region , particularly in italy where a ` refugee crisis ' has coincided with the attempts of anti-gaddafi libyans to flee the country .
",
12554,0,," if the eu is to take its growing role upon the world stage seriously , it needs a dedicated defence force to make an impact in the region .
",
12555,0,,"incumbency provides a huge election advantage .
",
12556,0,," politicians almost always win reelection .
",
12557,0,," the frequency with which they win varies over time and between states , but incumbency is always a powerful advantage .
",
12558,0,," this is seen most visibly in the united states congress of the pastyears , in which it has become virtually impossible to unseat an incumbent legislator .
",
12559,0,," legislators are reelected because they have better name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby groups .
",
12560,0,," people have a tendency to vote for whom they recognize , and firms tend to support past winners who will likely continue to benefit their interests .
",
12561,0,," term limits actually increase voter choice by making elections more competitive and encouraging more candidates to run .
",
12562,0,," in areas where term limits have been instituted there is far higher turnover amongst legislators , giving voters far more choice in who should represent them .
",
12563,0,," in california , the institution of term limits on state legislators caused a rush of retirements , which led topercent more candidates than would otherwise have been expected , as well as a marked increase in the diversity of the backgrounds of those elected .
",
12564,0,," ultimately , old legislators using election machines to retain power do their country and constituents a disservice .
",
12565,0,," power is best used when it changes hands over time in order to allow for dynamic new solutions to be mooted in a changing world .
",
12566,0,," power is highly intoxicating ; it can corrupt even the most scrupled individual given enough exposure over time .
",
12567,0,," for this reason , power should not be left in the hands of specific individuals for too long .
",
12568,0,," when a politician is firmly entrenched , he may seek to enrich himself at the expense of the public .
",
12569,0,," he may seek to shower benefices on family and allies in order to maintain and strengthen his powerful position .
",
12570,0,," without term limits legislators often become self-serving individuals , more interested in craving out personal power bases than with serving the people who elected them .
",
12571,0,," because legislators are so likely to be reelected , lobbyists and special interest groups find the lines of power in states ' capitals largely predictable , and are thus able to buy the influence of the permanent power nexuses in the legislature with relative ease1 .
",
12572,0,," term limits serve to limit the ability of individuals to put forward self-serving legislation and to retain power indefinitely.
",
12573,0,," instead , by maintaining term limits , legislators have only a limited time in power , which tends to shift their focus toward genuinely benefiting the public .
",
12574,0,," a major focus of a legislator hoping to serve another term is on the next election and on vote getting .
",
12575,0,," it is often the case that hard decisions need to be made by legislators , but it is difficult for them to do so when they are fixated on being reelected .
",
12576,0,," legislators have an incentive to put tough decisions off if they can retain power by doing so .
",
12577,0,," an example of such seemingly perpetual procrastination is observable in the united states congress 's attitude toward social security .
",
12578,0,," the fund is set to become insolvent , by some estimates , in less than two decades , yet congressmen and senators have chosen time and again to put off enacting painful , but necessary reform to the system .
",
12579,0,," they find it easier to delay a decision until the next congress , preferring their own reelection to the good of the nation .
",
12580,0,," when constrained by term limits , legislators must make the most of their limited time in office , resulting in greater prioritization of difficult decisions and reform1 .
",
12581,0,," furthermore , the need to constantly fight elections places politicians in the pocket of lobby-groups and election supporters to a greater degree , as they will always need to go back to them for support , and thus can not make decisions that are in the national interest alone .
",
12582,0,," while there will always be some of this behavior , it is curtailed by term limits , as legislators will , in their final term at the very least , not be beholden to as many special interests as they can not run again .
",
12583,0,," bolder legislative action is observed from retiring legislators in the united states congress , for example .
",
12584,0,," when a congressman or senator does not intend to seek reelection , his tendency to vote along strict party lines diminishes substantially .
",
12585,0,," term limits , just like voluntary retirement , leads legislators to vote more on the basis of principle than on party stance2 .
",
12586,0,," the result of this is a more independent legislature , with a greater interest in actually serving the people .
",
12587,1,,"a cyber attack is an attack on computer based systems to sabotage them or to spy on others, through such means as viruses, hacking, denial-of-service attacks (i.e. dos - making the network resource or machine unavailable for its intended users), and others [1][2].
",
12588,1,," large scale cyber attacks can be referred to as cyberterrorism, and if carried out by one state against the other in a politically-motivated attack – as cyberwarfare.
",
12589,1,," in this case the potential damage is substantially larger and can range from disabling websites, stealing classified data to disabling essential services such as power grids [3].
",
12590,1,,"due to its potentially huge impact on the state should a large scale cyber attack succeed, it has been questioned whether a definition of war and acts of war have to be expanded to non-traditional measures [4].
",
12591,1,," for instance, as ofusa considers cyber attacks as acts of war if they are sufficiently disruptive [5].
",
12592,1,," however such definition is not universally and internationally accepted as at the moment only an armed conflict is considered an act of war, as defined by the un charter [6].
",
12593,0,," the world has developed along with the new digital medium .
",
12594,0,," lots of crucial business and government services have moved online .
",
12595,0,," while the military modernised in relation to digital developments , a definition of an act of war has not caught up with it yet .
",
12596,0,," it is now being suggested that the digital domain is the new realm of warfare for the 21st century .
",
12597,0,," states have already been using cyber attacks in hostilities and as acts of aggression against each other .
",
12598,0,," for instance , usa and israel have released a virus stuxnet that sabotaged parts of iran 's nuclear programme in, followed by retaliatory cyber attacks by iran on usa  .
",
12599,0,," in thewar over kosovo the usa successfully hacked serbia 's air defence systems , which left serbia vulnerable to air attacks   .
",
12600,0,," cyber attacks are thus attacks that can be perpetrated by states against other states in an effort to weaken the other state , the same way armed attacks are used .
",
12601,0,," given these realities large scale cyber attacks should be considered acts of war .
",
12602,0,," large scale cyber attacks can result in substantial harms to the state equivalent to those of an armed attack .
",
12603,0,," many states are dependent on flawless functioning of government and financial services online , and attacking them would cause mass disruption .
",
12604,0,," for example , massive cyber attacks can cause serious disruption to economy by targeting financial , banking and commercial services ; they can target government websites and steal confidential information that would compromise country 's security , as was the case with usa in ; they could target power grids and shut down infrastructure on a massive scale across the country .
",
12605,0,," all these instances cause disruption and leave the targeted country vulnerable with the government unable to operate successfully .
",
12606,0,," this way , for instance , a large scale cyber attack from russia on georgiacaused massive disruption to government , banking services , and communication within and outside of the country  .
",
12607,0,," for these reasons usa 's pentagon decided to consider a cyber attack that ` produces the death , damage , destruction or high-level disruption that a traditional military attack would cause ' an act of war  .
",
12608,0,," given the damage of possible attacks to the state , large-scale cyber attacks should be considered an act of war .
",
12609,0,," currently international law on how a state can respond to cyber attacks by another state is lacking : it only covers cyber attacks during armed conflicts or those are tantamount to an armed conflict  .
",
12610,0,," an attacked state thus has no legitimate means to respond to cyber attacks .
",
12611,0,," this leaves them no option of self-defence , which is an important element in international law .
",
12612,0,," moreover , without international law regulating cyber warfare between states , there is no actual illegitimacy for cyber attacks .
",
12613,0,," despite their far-reaching and grave consequences , cyber attacks by other states do not feature heavily in the news .
",
12614,0,," few people actually know about cyber attacks between usa and iran , which would be an unimaginable situation should these states resorted to military attacks .
",
12615,0,," this apparent lack of condemnation and attention in the wider society to cyber attacks further decreases ability of the state to defend themselves or even call out an aggressor publically as there is little to fear from global opinion for such actions .
",
12616,1,,"labour, together with the conservatives one of the two parties that dominate uk politics, is traditionally a left of centre party but has, since the mid 1990s been a centrist party rebranded as ‘new labour’.
",
12617,1,," the labour party has however lost the last two elections; inunder gordon brown, and inwhen the leader was ed miliband.
",
12618,1,," with ed miliband having resigned after his party’s poor performance at the general election labour engaged in a leadership contest through the summer of 2015.
",
12619,1,," jeremy corbyn got onto the ballot with the help of labour mps who wanted to increase the bredth of the debate in the contest rather than leaving it between three centerists.
",
12620,1,," however benefitting from a change in the election rules that gives the membership much more say – limiting that of mps and unions – saw a surge in support for corbyn who eventually won with 59.5% of the vote.
",
12621,1,,"so what does being left wing actually mean anyway?
",
12622,1,," generally it means being radical, reforming and socialist.
",
12623,1,," it can be, and often is, progressive.
",
12624,1,," in economic terms it usually means more state control (on behalf of the people) of the economy with it traditionally meaning complete nationalisation.
",
12625,1,," and in social political terms it means more equality and power to the people rather than elites.
",
12626,1,,"since the consensus for the last couple of decades has been that more state control over the economy is a bad thing having someone who is in favour of it in charge of a major party is potentially a big change.
",
12627,1,," it leads to the question of whether moving to the left is good either for labour or for the country.
",
12628,0,," the original values of the labour party were `` the common ownership of the means of production , distribution , and exchange '' and even today the labour party aims to `` serve the public interest '' as well as to create `` a just society , which judges its strength by the condition of the weak as much as the strong '' , `` an open democracy , in which government is held to account by the people '' , and `` a healthy environment '' .
",
12629,0,," in the last parliament labour supported there being a cap on welfare spending .
",
12630,0,," more recently labour abstained on a conservative welfare bill that many felt was too harsh in its cuts .
",
12631,0,," corbyn , and a move to the left , will bring labour back to its core values rather than supporting conservative policies and austerity that harms individuals .
",
12632,0,," since the start of the 1990s labour has moved to the right to contest the ` centre ground ' of politics .
",
12633,0,," this worked inwhen the conservatives were a spent force afteryears in power .
",
12634,0,," tony blair successfully stole the conservatives moderate policies .
",
12635,0,," however this has resulted in the centre ground moving to the right with policies such as austerity and welfare cuts becoming a consensus .
",
12636,0,," labour needs to move left to fight on their own ground forcing other parties to match their more populist policies such as renationalising the railways .
",
12637,0,," corbyn in his last campaign rally argued `` fundamentally many people are turned off by a political process when the major parties are not saying anything different enough about how we run the economy '' .
",
12638,0,," this lack of choice has been a complaint by voters for years -- ever since tony blair made new labour electable by moving to the centre .
",
12639,0,," jeremy corbyn now gives the electorate a real choice compared to the conservative party ; tackling the deficit through tax rises , rather than cutting spending , nationalising the railways , peoples quantitaive easing , do n't replace trident , and rent controls .
",
12640,0,," the public `` are totally turned off by a style of politics which seems to rely on the levels of club house theatrical abuse that you can throw across at each other in parliament and across the airwaves . ''
",
12641,0,," this style is necessary to extentuate the small areas where there are differences between the parties .
",
12642,0,," introduce real differences on the big issues of government , particularly the economy and society , then such minor point scoring fades into insignificance .
",
12643,1,,"using the electoral system of proportional representation (pr) means that the percentage of the popular vote that a party wins becomes the percentage of the seats that party receives in parliament.
",
12644,1,," the person elected to sit in that parliament is usually decided by means of party lists, where the party lists its candidates in order; if it winsseats in parliament, the firstcandidates on its list are elected as members of that parliament.
",
12645,1,," many countries use it for national elections, though there are variations in how it is done.
",
12646,1,,"other countries do not operate pr in elections but use majoritarian systems instead, which give the majority of the seats to the party with a plurality of the vote.
",
12647,1,," under this system each constituency (a defined geographical area) elects its own representative(s) from among a group of rival candidates competing only for that constituency.
",
12648,1,," in the uk, elections are organised on a first past the post (fptp) basis, where the candidate with the highest number of votes is elected to represent that constituency; in an area where more than two parties attract significant support this usually means the winner has little more than 40% of the popular vote (a scottish mp was once elected with only 28% of the votes in a tight four-party contest).
",
12649,1,," in australia, the alternative vote (av) system is used, where voters list candidates in order of preference; candidates with the fewest votes are progressively eliminated from the count and their ballots are individually transferred to the voter's next preference until one candidate receives over 50% support and is duly elected.
",
12650,1,,"the above outline simplifies the situation in most countries, where varying forms of pr may be used, perhaps by having very large constituencies with multiple representatives elected by pr from party lists, or by using pr for some elections and a constituency system for others.
",
12651,0,," recently, italy has moved away from pr while the uk has begun to use it for elections to the european parliament and in the new scottish, welsh, northern ireland and london assemblies.
",
12652,0,,"adversarial democratic systems such as the united states , britain and australia have been becoming increasingly dysfunctional with politics simply being a shouting match .
",
12653,0,," coalition governments lead to cooperation and compromise between parties1 .
",
12654,0,," governments which are forced to acknowledge a wide range of public opinion are less likely to introduce policies which victimise minorities or ride roughshod over public opinion for ideological reasons ; for example , the poll tax in the uk , 1988-92 .
",
12655,0,," empirically , countries with pr systems , such as germany , show that great prosperity can result from the policies of such governments .
",
12656,0,," pr results in more engagement in politics as every vote counts1 .
",
12657,0,," political participation is good and we should care about the low voter turnout in elections that has been caused by first past the post .
",
12658,0,," surveys show that that those who vote are more engaged in the community in other ways and have better personal wellbeing .
",
12659,0,," research in switzerland has shown that voting does make people happier as well as being better informed citizens .
",
12660,0,," the higher the stake the person has , and the more likely their vote is to count the more effort they will make to find out the facts so as to make informed choices .2 2 marks et al.
",
12661,0,,"  p5-6 first past the post , fptp , often results in a party without majority support being able to dominate parliament .
",
12662,0,," minority parties , such as the green party and ukip , in the uk , which can win 5-10 % or so of the vote all over the country , can fail to win a single seat .
",
12663,0,," in the ukgeneral election , ukip received 919,546 votes across the country , but not a single seat1 .
",
12664,0,," parties with a uniform vote across the country are punished unfairly .
",
12665,0,," thus in singapore 's general election ofthe national solidarity party contestedseats and won 39.25 % of the valid votes across the wards it contested yet still failed to win any seats .2 theoretically parties could win huge numbers of votes , potentially up to% in every constituency , without ever getting any representation in parliament .
",
12666,0,," as such fptp favours parties that appeal to local issues or to particular segments of the population these parties that are losing out are likely to be those parties that either appeal to a broad segment of the population or whose support is based upon an issue that affects everyone .
",
12667,0,," furthermore , in the ukgeneral election , two thirds of mps were elected without receiving a majority of the votes in their constituency3 .
",
12668,0,," this suggests that most people are being represented by people they did n't vote for .
",
12669,0,," all political parties have seats that they consider safe and unlikely to lose .
",
12670,0,," if a person in an inner city constituency that has a strong labour history , wishes to vote for someone other than labour , then their vote is effectively null and void .
",
12671,0,," labour will win a majority however they vote .
",
12672,0,," the fact that the seat is so safe means that there is effectively very little effect people can have , resulting in thousands of people 's vote being wasted and having no effect when it comes to forming a government .
",
12673,0,," in theuk general election the result was decided by less than 460,000 voters in onlyconstituencies .
",
12674,0,," this gives an unfair amount of political influence to a tiny minority of the electorate while making the majority 's votes close to worthless .
",
12675,1,,"voter identification laws are controversial precisely because they touch on one of the most fundamental political rights—voting.
",
12676,1,," these laws concern a simple policy that revolves around difficult factual questions, over which there is much disagreement.
",
12677,1,," is voter fraud a real problem?
",
12678,1,," do voter id laws cause a downturn in voter turnout?
",
12679,1,," if so, does it prevent any particular demographic from voting more than others?
",
12680,1,," there have been many studies on these questions, often with contradictory conclusions.
",
12681,1,," the economist wrote of this debate, “neither side has much evidence.”
",
12682,1,," a more accurate assessment would be that neither side has much conclusive evidence.
",
12683,1,,"in the united states, thehelp america vote act (hava) required that all voters show identification, either when they register or the first time they vote, but not necessarily after that.
",
12684,1,," many states have already passed laws that go further, though, requiring identification each time voters go to the polls.
",
12685,1,," several challenges to these voter identification laws have been mounted in the united states.
",
12686,1,," famously in 1966, the supreme court struck down the poll tax in harper v. bd.
",
12687,1,," of elections of virginia, but upheld the lawfulness of voter identification requirements, as long as they are “even handed.”
",
12688,1,," most recently in 2008, in the indiana case of crawford v. marion county election board, the u.s. supreme court held that voter identification requirements are permissible and do not violate the u.s. constitution.
",
12689,1,,"most democracies around the world require a form of identification at the polling station.
",
12690,1,," most of them also, however, provide this identification as part of a system of “automatic and permanent” voter registration.
",
12691,1,," in the united states, this is not the case.
",
12692,1,," although a majority of u.s. states require some form of voter identification at the polling station, what is required varies widely.
",
12693,1,," some require a signature, some will accept any form of identification, such as an employee or student card, while some demand a photo id card issued by the state itself (such as a driving license).
",
12694,1,," debating the issue at a country or u.s.-state level will mean both sides have to be clear about the local rules or proposals.
",
12695,1,," for a broader  principle of the idea, it may be best for the proposition to simply advocate photo id cards as a standard requirement, while specifying whether the id must be issued by the state.
",
12696,1,," because this issue is most contentious in the united states, it is likely that many examples will come from there, but there is room for exploration into electoral systems where the issue is less publicized.
",
12697,0,," in the united states , there are currently very different identification requirements for voting from state to state , meaning that people often lose their vote when they change their place of residence .
",
12698,0,," all states could require a photo id , or the country could adopt a national voter identification standard , based on thefederal standards for american driving licenses , often called the `` real id card '' .
",
12699,0,," these actions would ensure against voter fraud and make it easier for people to maintain an active citizenship .
",
12700,0,," in addition to cutting down on lost votes , this system would make the electoral process more legitimate in the eyes of the public , a factor that could itself raise voter turnout .
",
12701,0,," people are already required to produce valid identification for a whole range of activities that are less important than casting a vote , such as going to the gym or buying a drink .
",
12702,0,," why is voting the only activity where we make it easy to cheat the system ?
",
12703,0,," the claims that voter identification laws are discriminatory , or that they would discourage people from voting are silly because so many aspects of everyday life require photo identification , that this would not realistically discourage people from voting .
",
12704,0,," studies have shown that nearlycountries around the world have photo identification requirements for voting , so the usa would not be unique in asking its citizens to provide proof of their identity at the polling station .
",
12705,0,," this also suggests that it is not too difficult to organise voting ids , as democracies much poorer than the united states succeed in doing so .
",
12706,0,," former u.s. president jimmy carter , who is currently co-chair of the commission on federal election reform , is a democrat who supports voter identification laws .
",
12707,0,," he points out , `` mexico and most poor democracies in the world have been able to register and give ids to almost all their citizens . ''
",
12708,0,," indeed , it is bizarre to many election experts around the world that the united kingdom and many parts of the united states do not require identification .
",
12709,0,," innocent chukwuma , an election monitor who has observed elections in nigeria and the uk said , of the uk system , `` if you had this system in nigeria , the outsiders would say the potential for abuse would be massive . ''
",
12710,0,," meanwhile voter identification has been a challenge worth meeting for most of the world .
",
12711,0,," even india -- by far the largest democracy in the world -- created inthe unique identification authority of india , uidai , which will provide a national identity card to all indians , which they can use at polling stations .
",
12712,0,," countries around the world have set the standard by proving that voter identification laws are practical ways of improving the integrity of elections .
",
12713,0,," those countries that have not yet adopted the system should do so .
",
12714,1,,"the comprehensive test ban treaty (ctbt) outlaws the testing of nuclear weapons (united nations, 1996).
",
12715,1,," so far,countries signed the treaty, but it cannot become a binding international law until it has been ratified by all states capable of developing nuclear weapons, of which there arespecified in the treaty.
",
12716,1,," of these states, three (india, pakistan and north korea) have not signed the treaty, and a further six (china, egypt, israel, iran, and the united states) are yet to ratify it (preparatory commission, 2010).
",
12717,1,," the united states signed the treaty in 1996, as soon as the language was agreed upon, but the senate rejected it by a tiny margin.
",
12718,1,," while the idea of the ctbt is quite simple, implementation is immensely complex.
",
12719,1,," one of the greatest concerns of the treaty, and of the international community, is with monitoring countries so as to verify their compliance with the ban.
",
12720,1,," to this end the treaty sets up the international monitoring system (ims), a network of hundreds of scientific facilities spread across the globe which monitor seismic activity, radioactive fallout, atmospheric noise and oceanic waves to pick up evidence of a nuclear explosion.
",
12721,1,," if the ims detects a suspected nuclear test then an on-site inspection can follow.
",
12722,1,," the treaty does not detail the action that would be taken against a state that has broken the treaty, but the charter of the united nations does empower the security council to take ""appropriate steps"".
",
12723,1,," although the treaty has not yet come into force, most of the ims is now in place and working.
",
12724,0,," debates about the ctbt revolve around the efficacy of the treaty to prevent nuclear testing, and whether it is in the interest of nuclear-capable, and would-be nuclear-capable, states to agree to it.
",
12725,0,,"nuclear weapons tests release vast quantities of radiation into the atmosphere , contaminating water supplies , soil , and harming human , plant , and animal health irreparably .
",
12726,0,," the bomb tests conducted by the united states betweenand, for example , releasedtimes the radioactivity of the chernobyl disaster1 .
",
12727,0,," radioactivity released by russian tests in the 1950s and 1960s are estimated to have released even greater amounts of radiation .
",
12728,0,," it is estimated that 2.4 million people currently living will die due to cancers caused by radioactivity generated by nuclear testing .
",
12729,0,," the genetic damage created by nuclear tests has killed , and will kill many innocent people .
",
12730,0,," accidents can also occur , as in the united states when an accident insaw inhabitants of towns near a test site blanketed in the radioactive plume .
",
12731,0,," such horrors can not be allowed to continue , but would be all the more likely in poorer countries trying to test weapons .
",
12732,0,," furthermore , nuclear testing has done untold damage to the environment and ecosystems around the world .
",
12733,0,," in the pacific , for example , hydrogen bomb testing destroyed whole ecologies .
",
12734,0,," even when tested underground nuclear weapons are dangerous to the environment , with radiation seeping out of test sites at half of all such tests2 .
",
12735,0,," it is imperative that the environmentally devastating effects of these weapons not be allowed to continue through testing .

",
12744,1,,"modern systems of government seek, through constitutions and legislation to divide the powers of the state between separate branches of government, so that power never rests in the hands of any one individual.
",
12745,1,," this is done with varying degrees of success in governments around the world; developed european and north american countries have constructed quite robust systems for the separation of powers, while in much of the developing world, particularly in africa, asia, and parts of south america power has settled in the hands of powerful individuals, both elected and dictatorial.
",
12746,1,," one of the major tools used to try to check executive power is the institution of term limits.
",
12747,1,," term limits seek to limit the extent to which single individuals can dominate the governments of countries, and have succeeded in being upheld to varying extents around the world.
",
12748,1,," the united states for example has a limit of two terms for the presidency which was changed from being an informal limit created by george washington when he refused a third term to being formal by the twenty second amendment infollowing franklin delano roosevelt’s four term presidency from 1933-45.
",
12749,1,," the united kingdom on the other hand has no term limits on its prime minister.
",
12750,1,," this should not be about individual office holders and whether they should have had a third term – or in roosevelt’s case not had one.
",
12751,1,," instead this debate should be about the principle of term limits for the highest executive office.
",
12752,1,,"possible mechanism:the executive is only one of the branches of government.
",
12753,1,," the legislature and the judiciary often have equally important roles to play and in the context of term limits it is up to them to set the limit.
",
12754,1,," the term limit will require a super majority of the legislature to pass as if it is to be effective it should become part of the constitution so that it cannot be easily changed by the executive and his supporters in the legislature.
",
12755,1,," the united states did this inwhen the twenty-second amendment of the united states constitution was passed by two thirds majority in both houses of congress and ratified by three quarters of the states.
",
12756,0,," term limits are a necessary check on executive power to prevent an over mighty executive .
",
12757,0,," whereas the legislature and judiciary are composed of many competing views , with members of various parties and outlooks represented , the executive of a country speaks with a single voice .
",
12758,0,," in legislatures , party leaders are not the sole sources of power , with factions and alternative nexuses of influence forming throughout that branch of government .
",
12759,0,," executive power , on the other hand , rests solely in the hands of the leader , usually a president .
",
12760,0,," the leader has full power over the policies of the executive branch of government .
",
12761,0,," cabinets , which form part of the executive in practice , are usually directly answerable to the leader , and ministers can be dismissed if they are uncooperative or dispute the leader 's policies .
",
12762,0,," even in parliamentary systems , leaders with a majority and a strong party whip can command the same powers as a strong president , if not more .
",
12763,0,," it is thus necessary to have a check on the highly individual power that is the executive .
",
12764,0,," term limits are the best such check .
",
12765,0,," term limits allow leaders to enact their policies over a set time period and then usher them out of office .
",
12766,0,," this is essential , because too much power in the hands of a single individual for too long can upset the balance of power in a country and shift power in favour of the executive , thus damaging the protections to society that checks provide .
",
12767,0,," this is exactly what happened in the united kingdom under tony blair where from the start cabinet government virtually disappeared former cabinet secretary lord butler said `` in the eight months i was cabinet secretary when tony blair was prime minister , the only decision the cabinet took was about the millennium dome , '' and power continued to be ever more centralized in response to terrorism .
",
12768,0,," power has a strong tendency to corrupt ; it is highly intoxicating .
",
12769,0,," for this reason , it should not be left in the hands of one person for too long .
",
12770,0,," when a leader is firmly entrenched , he may seek to enrich himself at the expense of the public .
",
12771,0,," he may seek to shower benefices on family and allies in order to maintain and strengthen his powerful position .
",
12772,0,," without term limits the executive runs the risk of becoming a personal fief , rather than the office of first servant of the people , as it should be .
",
12773,0,," this is seen particularly in parts of the developing world where leaders use state funds to generate electoral support from key groups and to maintain the loyalty of essential supporters .
",
12774,0,," a current example of this is in venezuela where hugo chavez has been able to monopolize power to the point where it is unclear who his successor would be should he die suddenly .
",
12775,0,," term limits serve to limit the ability of individuals to enact self-aggrandizing policies and to retain power indefinitely .
",
12776,0,," instead , by maintaining term limits , leaders have only a limited time in power , which tends to shift their focus toward genuinely benefiting the public .
",
12777,0,," incumbency provides a huge election advantage .
",
12778,0,," leaders and politicians generally , almost always win re-election .
",
12779,0,," such has been the case in the united states , for example , where presidents are almost always re-elected for a second term .
",
12780,0,," leaders are re-elected because they have better name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby groups .
",
12781,0,," people have a tendency to vote for those who they recognize , and firms tend to support past winners who will likely continue to benefit their interests .
",
12782,0,," this problem has become particularly serious in developing world in which revolutionary leaders from the original independence movements are still politically active .
",
12783,0,," these leaders often command huge followings and mass loyalty , which they use to maintain power in spite of poor decisions and corruption in many cases .
",
12784,0,," such has been the case in zimbabwe with robert mugabe winning presidential elections in spite of mass corruption and mismanagement .
",
12785,0,," only recently have the people finally voted against him , but it was too late , as his power had become too entrenched to unseat him .
",
12786,0,," the uphill battle that will always exist to unseat incumbents makes term limits necessary .
",
12787,0,," countries need new ideas and new leaders to enact them .
",
12788,0,," old leaders using election machines to retain power do their country a disservice .
",
12789,0,," power is best used when it changes hands over time in order allow for dynamic new solutions to be mooted in a changing world .
",
12790,0,," a focus of a leader who is looking toward the next election is on getting votes .
",
12791,0,," it is often the case that hard decisions need to be made by leaders , but it is difficult for them to do so when they are concerned with being re-elected .
",
12792,0,," a leader has an incentive to put tough decisions off if he can retain power by doing so .
",
12793,0,," when constrained by term limits , leaders must make the most of their limited time in office , resulting in greater prioritization of difficult decisions and reform .
",
12794,0,," furthermore , the need to constantly fight elections places leaders in the pocket of lobby-groups and election supporters to a greater degree , as they will always need to go back to them for support , and thus can not make decisions that are in the national interest alone .
",
12795,0,," while there will always be some of this behaviour , it is curtailed by term limits , as leaders in their final term will not be beholden to as many special interests as they can not run again .
",
12796,0,," furthermore , leaders who develop strong party structures can influence the choice of their successor , ensuring that they have a legacy .
",
12797,0,," in this way term limits encourage the development of party-based systems , rather than personality based systems of government .
",
12798,1,,"in october it was revealed that the united states’ national security agency had bugged german chancellor angela merkel’s telephone calls and had been spying on her since– long before she became chancellor in 2005.
",
12799,1,," although the suggestion was first reported in the newspaper der spiegel it was taken seriously enough that the bnd, germany’s federal intelligence service, investigated and they too came to the conclusion that the german chancellor had been bugged by the nsa.
",
12800,1,," merkel was not amused: “the federal chancellor spoke with president obama today by telephone.
",
12801,1,," she made it clear that, if the indications prove to be correct, she unequivocally disapproves of such practices, and considers them totally unacceptable.
",
12802,1,," among friends and partners, like the federal republic of germany and the us have been for decades, such surveillance of communication of heads of government should not take place.
",
12803,1,," this would be a grave breach of trust.
",
12804,1,," such practices must immediately be put to a stop.”
",
12805,1,,"merkel is not the only world leader that has been spied upon by the nsa; the agency spied on at leastleaders.
",
12806,1,," however she is the most prominent, as well as being an americophile and the head of a country that is a prominent us ally; it might be expected that the us would be attempting to bug the phone of a rival’s leader such as putin’s but not a close ally.
",
12807,1,,"despite the statements of outrage as the spying was revealed merkel would prefer to resolve the situation quietly through diplomacy but there has been little progress in talks and it may not be entirely here decision to make.
",
12808,1,," the german federal prosecutor, harald range, says that he has sufficient evidence to launch an investigation into the surveillance of the chancellor’s phone.
",
12809,1,," whether there is a prosecution is mostly up to the prosecutor; the justice minister can block an investigation but it is very rare, and in this case would be controversial.
",
12810,0,," monitoring communications in germany 's capital -- including the communications of government leaders like merkel would be illegal under german law .
",
12811,0,," numerous politicians , such as then interior minister hans-peter friedrich have stated that those `` responsible must be held accountable '' .
",
12812,0,," there are even those , such as gregor gysi from the far left left party who say `` the fact that the german government and the federal prosecutor is n't acting shows that their fear of the us government is greater than their respect for our legal system . ''
",
12813,0,," when an act is illegal the state has a moral responsibility to prosecute that act .
",
12814,0,," it should not be ok for another state to break the law simply because it is an ally and there is a desire to keep relations cordial .
",
12815,0,," the german government has been working towards a ` no-spy agreement ' with the united states .
",
12816,0,," it however looks unlikely that such a deal will every become a reality with officials saying `` we wo n't get anything '' and `` the americans lied to us '' about the chances of an agreement .
",
12817,0,," german officials have also been disparaging of obama 's new announcements on restrictions of the nsa ; roettgen , a member of merkel 's party says `` the fundamental question is , should security services be able to do everything they 're technically able to do , obama essentially said ` yes ''' .
",
12818,0,," if germany ca n't get an agreement then it has no choice but to act unilaterally .
",
12819,0,," politics is about action .
",
12820,0,," the german government has to take some action on the issue of nsa surveillance and german privacy or it will look weak .
",
12821,0,," interior minister hans-peter friedrich went to washington in july but was accused of `` returning empty-handed '' and having `` not moved a single step forward on any of the key points '' .
",
12822,0,," the stonewalling by the united states provides an opportunity for opponents to damage merkel 's new government as well as potentially to show gaps between the sdp and csu .
",
12823,0,," merkel has been invited to visit washington at some point inby president obama , merkel ca n't afford for her own diplomacy to have as little result as friedrich 's .
",
12824,1,,"on thursdayseptemberpeople in scotland will vote on the question 'should scotland be an independent country'.
",
12825,1,," what scotland's relationship with europe will be in one, five or ten years after the referendum is unclear.
",
12826,1,,"            a scot voting no (to remain in the uk) could not be sure that scotland will be in the eu in a decade because of the possibility of a uk referendum on leaving the eu.
",
12827,1,," in januarythe coalition government passed a bill that implemented a 'referendum lock' which would require a uk referendum on the eu if there were any major treaty changes.
",
12828,1,," this lock is currently the only legislation for a referendum.
",
12829,1,," however, in januarydavid cameron promised an in/out eu referendum by the end ofif he won the next general election.
",
12830,1,," despite this commitment tory eurosceptics regretted the lack of an eu referendum in the queen's speech and so put forward their own referendum bill which is going through the commons to guarantee a vote, at the time of writing it looks likely to pass (and then get savaged in the house of lords which however cant stop the commons passing it).
",
12831,1,," therefore a referendum on staying in or leaving the eu looks likely within the next five years or so.
",
12832,1,,"            a scot voting yes (to create an independent scotland) would be equally unsure of the implications of their choice.
",
12833,1,," scotland's relationship with the eu in the event of independence is a hotly contested issue which the subject of the debate, the eu itself, has done little to clarify.
",
12834,1,," nothing in the eu treaties deals with what would happen should a region within the eu become independent.
",
12835,1,," whether scotland is regarded as a continuing state or a new state affects whether it would remain in the eu or would have to apply for membership.
",
12836,1,," the commission has implied it would have to apply for membership and this raises the possibility that scotland would at least temporarily leave the eu following independence.
",
12837,1,,"            certainly there would be much more clarity to a vote on scottish independence if scottish voters knew whether they were voting to remain part of a uk within the eu or one that would not be, rather than voting not knowing if they would be ejected from the eu against their will a few years down the line.
",
12838,1,," this argument has been made by those in favour of an early eu referendum but is now certain not to happen.
",
12839,0,," the scottish national party , snp , has said that they would not hold an eu referendum in an independent scotland .
",
12840,0,," scotland is interestingly should scotland become independent and accede to the eu there would have to be a treaty change to provide for scottish representation in eu institutions .
",
12841,0,," this could well trigger an eu referendum in the remainder of the uk , ruk , under the ` referendum lock ' .
",
12842,0,," according to a februaryipsos-mori poll scots want an eu referendum but% would vote to stay in the eu and only% would vote to leave .
",
12843,0,," indeed if scotland became independent those who wanted it to be in the eu rose to% and the number who wanted out fell to% .
",
12844,0,," in england% would vote to leave , as of november, and% would vote to stay in .
",
12845,0,," the uk independence party whose principal policy platform is a desire to leave the eu has performed considerably worse in scotland than in england .
",
12846,0,," in thegeneral election ukip received 3.1 % of the vote whereas in the scottish election the next year they only received 0.9 % of the vote .
",
12847,0,," similarly in theeuropean parliament elections ukip came second nationally receiving almost 2.5 million votes , 16.5 % of all votes cast but in scotland it came 6th , beaten by all four main parties and the greens receiving only 5.2 % of the vote .
",
12848,0,," scots clearly believe their interests lie with europe and it would be better for scotland not to be tied to a country where sentiment is considerably more negative towards the eu .
",
12849,0,," states are often seen as having one single unitary interest , however this is not the case the interests of different regions can be very different .
",
12850,0,," it should therefore not be surprising that scotland and ruk have different interests with relation to the eu .
",
12851,0,," for example on climate change scotland has the greatest potential for the generation of renewable energy in europe with% of europe 's tidal potential and% of wave potential yet the uk is in favour of scrapping european targets for the generation of renewable energy .
",
12852,0,," uk ministers have also been accused of `` working against scotland '' on agriculture being willing to accept reductions in farm support meaning that scotland receives the lowest level in europe .
",
12853,0,," scotland 's own interests would therefore be better represented by having its own government at the negotiating table than a uk government .
",
12854,1,,"terrorism, according to wikipedia, is, broadly speaking, “those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for a religious, political or ideological goal, and deliberately target or disregard the safety of civilians or non-combatants”.
",
12855,1,," there is some debate as to whether or not we can distinguish between terrorism and freedom fighters but for the purposes of this debate when we refer to terrorists we refer to groups such as al-qaeda, al-shabaab, hamas, hezbollah, the irish republican army, taliban and other such organisations that are generally recognised as terrorist.
",
12856,1,," compensation refers to a monetary payment given to the individual who are wither direct victims of a terrorist attacks or else to family members who suffer as a result of the death of a loved one.
",
12857,1,," it would be wise as a proposition to begin the debate by stipulating that this would only be possible where it is clear who the perpetrators were and what their nationality was.
",
12858,1,,"there are two possible scenarios.
",
12859,1,," either the terrorists have committed the atrocities in their own nation in which case there is less debate as we are far more inclined to believe that governments have certain duties towards their own citizens, or terrorists commit atrocities in countries other than their own, in which case there is a greater burden on the proposition to show why the state ought to be held responsible.
",
12860,1,,"so the questions to be answered in this debate are: are we justified in holding a state responsible for terrorist acts committed by its citizens?
",
12861,1,," what will the consequences of this policy be?
",
12862,1,,"the un suggests: the more viable alternative [to the motion under debate] is to create an international fund for victims of terrorism.
",
12863,1,," terrorism is a global phenomenon and we need a global solution to this menace so that the damage is mitigated to a certain extent.
",
12864,1,," this view of setting up an international fund was even backed by the un since the government can’t pay every time.
",
12865,1,," this fund was originally suggested to be providing financial support rather than compensation but could be easily adapted will serve better is a more viable alternative instead of calling on the government to pay up for acts of terror.
",
12866,1,,"this is one possible line that an opposition can take.
",
12867,1,," it is also possible for the opposition to argue that the government of the victims should pay the compensation or that there should be no compensation at all.
",
12868,1,," i will run the opposition line that the victim government should be paying compensation.
",
12869,0,," the state must pay compensation for the terrorist attacks because they are indirectly responsible for them .
",
12870,0,," it is the state 's duty to ensure that its citizens act within the law by providing deterrents , education and by preventing crimes through the use of intelligence .
",
12871,0,," even if the terrorist atrocities do not take place within the state , they were most probably planned within the state or initiated by someone who lives in the state .
",
12872,0,," this means that it was within the state 's power to have prevented the attack from taking place .
",
12873,0,," just as we would expect a state to investigate and track down a drug syndicate , we expect the state to track down terrorist organisations and prevent their activities .
",
12874,0,," in many cases , states are not only responsible in this manner but also in a more direct manner .
",
12875,0,," this may involve a paramilitary group -- a group that acts like a military but whose affiliation with the state or whose existence is kept secret .
",
12876,0,," it may involve the state supplying the terrorist group with weaponry , money or intelligence .
",
12877,0,," in these cases the state should clearly be held liable for the atrocities committed .
",
12878,0,," for example , iran supports hamas financially and also claims that it shares identical views on palestine with hamas .
",
12879,0,," iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to keep supporting hamas until the collapse of israel .
",
12880,0,," syrian president bashar assad as another example provides both funds and weaponry for hezbollah .
",
12881,0,," making the state pay for the wrongs of its citizens is therefore not only just but sends the message that the international community recognises the states involvement and duty in this regard .
",
12882,0,," this means that the state becomes responsible in the sense that it takes the blame .
",
12883,0,," if states are expected to pay compensation in this way then they are incentivised to take action against terrorist organisations to prevent incurring this massive cost .
",
12884,0,," they are more likely to put resources into investigating leads and to take a hard stance on terrorist activity .
",
12885,0,," this will decrease the prevalence of terrorism or at least make more intelligence available .
",
12886,0,," why would the expectations that a country should pay compensation be a strong enough motive to force nations to pay up ?
",
12887,0,," if it becomes commonplace and therefore expected , nations who do not pay compensation will be viewed as supporting terrorism or perhaps be suspected of being in cahoots with the terrorists .
",
12888,0,," this would be very harmful to the nation .
",
12889,0,," for example , in the case of the lockerbie bombing , suspicion of libya 's involvement lead to sanctions and poor international relations for many years .
",
12890,0,," libya ultimately felt it was better to pay $ 2.7 billion , $ 10million per person killed , than continue to face un sanctions .
",
12891,0,," compensation can prevent more violence because the victims are less likely to seek revenge if they feel that a , they have been recognised as victims b , the perpetrators , at least someone representing the perpetrators , has suffered financially and so some justice has been done c , they are more satisfied with the outcome of events because they have received money .
",
12892,0,," this is less important in scenarios such as the london train bombings and 9/11 where there is little chance of victims retaliating but it is important in conflicts that have revenge as a common theme .
",
12893,0,," for example , the israel-palestine conflict involves a lot of retaliation resembling age-old family feuds .
",
12894,0,," feuds are often prevented through the payment of blood money , in saudi arabia blood money rates are 100,000 riyals to compensate for the death of a muslim man .
",
12895,0,," perhaps we could use similar compensation to prevent some of this retaliation by compensating victims in the case of terrorism victims .
",
12896,0,," often when a terrorist attack occurs the victims feel anger not only towards the individual perpetrators or the terrorist organisation but towards the entire national , political , cultural or religious group they belong to .
",
12897,0,," an example of this is the flood of anti-muslim , anti-arab sentiment that arose after the 9/11 attacks .
",
12898,0,," this has a lot of negative consequences because it means that perfectly innocent people will suffer hate crimes and ostracization which in turns is likely to turn those people against the victims of the terrorist attack .
",
12899,0,," this kind of disharmony lays the foundation for poor international relations , discrimination and particularly make it difficult for integration to occur such a when a muslim family moves to the us .
",
12900,0,," when the state pays compensation for the terrorist attacks they are making a statement that they recognise terrorism to be wrong .
",
12901,0,," when this happens victims begin to distinguish from the terrorist organisation and the rest of the people in their cultural or national group .
",
12902,0,," this allows for greater cultural reconciliation .
",
12903,0,," the times when reparations tend to be suggested are when there is a wound of sorts between two groups of people that needs to be healed in order for there to be closure and reconciliation .
",
12904,0,," an example of this is after the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa when compensation was given to victims of apartheid .
",
12905,0,," we would argue that terrorist attacks fit perfectly into this frame because terrorist attacks tend to be committed by one group with a particular political , religious or national identity against another group with a different political , religious or national identity .
",
12906,0,," compensation plays a role in reconciling these two groups .
",
12907,0,," this compensation is not purely to provide the victims with things they have lost e.g. if they have lost the breadwinner of their family money will help them and if their home was burnt down again money will help .
",
12908,0,," compensation from one 's own government can fulfil this need .
",
12909,0,," but compensation from another government acts not only to fill financial needs but to provide reconciliation and closure .
",
12910,1,,"some modern states grant politicians outright immunity from prosecution.
",
12911,1,,"  in such countries, including albania, brazil and to a lesser degree france, politicians may not be subjected to criminal prosecution while they hold office.
",
12912,1,,"  other nations, such as the united states, have mechanisms of de facto immunity for politicians, by granting the head of the executive the uncontrolled power to issue pardons, effectively making any member of their cabinet immune.
",
12913,1,,"  many other nations give no such protections to the holders of political office, beyond protection from civil claims for remarks made while in parliament.
",
12914,1,,"the resolution is that politicians be granted a full and inviolate immunity from prosecution while serving.
",
12915,0,,"  the premier reason that most states , even those that allow for the prosecution of politicians , abstain from prosecuting them while they hold office is that being a politician is a job that requires one 's undivided attention .
",
12916,0,," especially for the holders of prominent national-level offices , writing legislation , responding to crises under one 's purview , consulting one 's constituents , and engaging in campaign work often lead to politicians working an upwards ofhour day , every day .
",
12917,0,," to expect politicians cope with all of these concerns will simultaneously constructing a defense against pending charges would be to abandon all hope of them serving their constituents effectively .
",
12918,0,," we are rightly aggravated when politicians take extensive vacations or other extracurricular forays .
",
12919,0,," being under indictment not only consumes even more of a politician 's time ; the stress it causes will inevitably seep into what remaining time they do allocating to fulfilling their duties , further hindering their performance .
",
12920,0,," the impeachment proceedings for bill clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice were so intensive that they took tremendous resources away from not only the president himself , but all branches of the federal government for several months , amidst serious domestic and foreign policy concerns such as the ongoing war in kosovo .
",
12921,0,," by the most popular definition , a state is the entity with the monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a defined territory .
",
12922,0,," politicians , as the government of that state , necessarily wield the institutions of that state force .
",
12923,0,," this results in the tremendous responsibility of deciding when the overwhelming power of the state is exercised .
",
12924,0,," this pertains to a variety of areas , such as police action against civil unrest , the interrogation of both alleged and convicted terrorists , and economic policies that subsidize industries with state resources .
",
12925,0,," while it is certainly possible to brazenly abuse this power , in many cases politicians are presented with options which are , if at all illegal , marginally so , and made with the good faith interest of the nation at heart .
",
12926,0,," there are even conceivable situations in which a politician may exercise options that are clearly illegal but serve an overwhelming state interest ; consider an illegal raid on a private building in order to prevent a nuclear bomb from going off .
",
12927,0,," while documented instances of policy-makers choosing not to act for a particular reason are rare , several senior cia officials stated that they had become risk averse merely because the idea of prosecuting officials who made security policy had entered the public discourse .
",
12928,0,," we ought to place politicians in a situation where the only factor in their decision-making process is what serves the public interest , rather than having to weigh what they consider to be the right action against the chance it will lead to their incarceration .
",
12929,0,," attempting to avoid this through a limited system which allowed for the prosecution of apolitical crimes but immunity for political decisions would fail to accomplish the goals of prosecution of politicians , which is primarily to protect against political abuses of state power which threaten the rights of the citizenry .
",
12930,0,," the obvious benefit to prosecuting politicians is that it punishes -- and thereby deters -- corruption by politicians .
",
12931,0,," however , this benefit can be achieved through other means .
",
12932,0,," firstly , many western liberal democracies have one form or another of removing a politician from office in the midst of their term , such as impeachment in the american system or a vote of no confidence against the government in the westminster system .
",
12933,0,," while defenders of immunity oppose impeachment as contrary to the principles outlined above , because of the effect that it may have on political duties , this is an option that remains in cases of gross misconduct .
",
12934,0,," if the political will can not be mobilized to remove a sitting politician , they are held accountable by the electorate to whom they must answer in the next election , and who will likely punish blatant misuse of political power .
",
12935,0,," even if the individual politician has reached a limit on their term of office , or does not seek reelection , they are still held in check by the damage that will be done to their party in the event of major misconduct on their part .
",
12936,0,," finally , most politicians are significantly concerned about their legacy , which is tarnished significantly by corruption even if they are never held legally accountable for it .
",
12937,0,," while nixon received a full pardon from his success , his name has become synonymous with criminality and scandal : a fate most politicians wish to avoid .
",
12938,0,," it does tremendous damage to the public perception of a given political position to see the holder of that position on trial for criminal acts .
",
12939,0,," politicians are important role models for the populace at large , and shining light on everyone one of their misdeeds is not conducive to them playing such a role .
",
12940,0,," this hurts the ability of their successors who , though completely innocent , are stepping into an institution now tainted with the image of corruption or scandal .
",
12941,0,," finally , the very process of prosecution can be damaging to the country , as citizens on opposing sides of the political spectrum disagree over the legitimacy of charges .
",
12942,0,," these effects all deal real damage to the political institutions necessary for the functioning of the state .
",
12943,0,," as noted above , the political life is steeped in difficult decisions , and some of these are bound to result in choices that are at least potentially illegal .
",
12944,0,," the ability to prosecute politicians incentivizes political opponents to search out past actions by said politicians so as to immobilize them politically .
",
12945,0,," such prosecutions are therefore not motivated by concern for justice , nor are they conducive to a well-functioning , multipartisan political system wherein representatives seek to work together to achieve their political ends .
",
12946,0,," in the most extreme cases , powerful politicians use prosecutions to immobilize their political opponents .
",
12947,1,,"in the united states, divided government describes a situation in which one party controls the white house and another party controls one or both houses of the united states congress.
",
12948,1,," divided government is suggested by some to be an undesirable product of the separation of powers in the united states' political system, resulting in political gridlock and little progress.
",
12949,1,," by others, it is considered a desirable outcome that helps maintain checks on the excesses of opposing political parties.
",
12950,1,," in theus presidential election, the topic received attention because the prospect of one-party rule loomed and subsequently became a reality with the election of democrat barack obama and further additions to the democratic majorities in the senate and house of representatives in the united states congress.
",
12951,1,," john mccain argued, in the last days of his presidential campaign, that electing barack obama would be a bad idea because it would lead to one-party rule and that this would be harmful.
",
12952,1,,"  with the republicans having regained control of the senate inthe question has arisen again in respect of thepresidential election.
",
12953,1,," the debate regarding divided government vs. one-party rule is framed by some of the following questions.
",
12954,1,," does divided government create a necessary check on government and the excesses of one political party or another?
",
12955,1,," can presidents of one political party more effectively constrain the actions of their own party?
",
12956,1,," does the supreme court provide a sufficient check on one-party rule?
",
12957,1,," is divided government more stable?
",
12958,1,," can one-party rule be important in passing legislation quickly and solving crises?
",
12959,1,," does divided government lift up more centrist, and perhaps more long-lasting ideas and reforms?
",
12960,1,," does divided government constrain corruption?
",
12961,1,," what does history demonstrate?
",
12962,1,," have divided or one-party governments been more successful?
",
12963,0,," what do voters prefer?
",
12964,0,,"by having both parties in charge of different parts of the government , there can be a greater degree of scrutiny over policy as the opposition party will force the president to justify his policies .
",
12965,0,," under single-party rule , there is a risk of a president being able to push through his/her agenda with little oversight from a legislative branch that is largely in agreement with the policy .
",
12966,0,," one need only look to authoritarian governments the world over to see that governments with too much power are likely to abuse that power .
",
12967,0,," divided government provides a check on the executive , preventing agendas to be pushed through , allowing for compromise to be made between the two major parties , ensuring that the best possible policy for americans is enacted .
",
12968,0,," as benjamin franklin wrote `` it is not enough that your legislature should be numerous ; it should also be divided . ''
",
12969,0,," the constitution of the united states is designed to prevent power from being concentrated in one place , with each of the three branches , executive , legislative and judicial , placing checks and balances upon each other .
",
12970,0,," as james madison wrote `` it is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers , but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part . ''
",
12971,0,," this principle ensures that power is divided , facilitating greater dialogue between the branches and between the two houses of congress which seeks to compromise with each other to provide the best possible expression of congress ' will .
",
12972,0,," such a need for compromise between the branches lends itself to having control of the two elected branches being spilt between two parties necessitating compromise as opposed to single party control of both houses , where compromise can be pre-arranged to fit the aims of the executive .
",
12973,0,," therefore , divided government is an extra requirement to government , ensuring that powers are not concentrated to the detriment of americans .
",
12974,0,," congress is a bicameral body , with its constituent parts , the house of representatives and senate , working largely independent of each other to create bills .
",
12975,0,," however necessary for both the house and senate to pass laws in identical form in order for it to become law .
",
12976,0,," a period of ` reconciliation ' is usually required to find a compromise between two different versions of the same bill in order to maintain and improve what is best about proposed reforms and eliminate flaws before it becomes law .
",
12977,0,," this independence between the two chambers , with reconciliation being one of the few areas where the two meet can allow for division in congress between the two major parties .
",
12978,0,," indeed this can be seen as beneficial , as the broadest ideological range will be considered when making a policy work by reconciling two bills , making sure that centrist policy is enacted , preventing an ideological swing against the wishes of the people .
",
12979,0,," divided government creates an imperative for compromise , encouraging the parties to work together for the best outcomes .
",
12980,0,," this can help to undermine the more visceral aspects of debate , with the contest for election being left behind in order to focus on governing for the good of all americans .
",
12981,0,," as a result the greatest american achievements have come when there has been broad bipartisan consensus .
",
12982,0,," there is also a partisan consideration to seeking divided government .
",
12983,0,," the more successful two-term presidents of recent times , ronald reagan and bill clinton , governed with congress partly or completely controlled by the opposition party .
",
12984,0,," they were able to work with the opposition to pursue the best policy , aiding their re-election hopes by pitching themselves as seeking to compromise , in line with the aspirations of voters , who on the whole prefer divided government in order to promote mature co-operation between the parties .
",
12985,1,,"nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever developed.
",
12986,1,," the right to possess these weapons is an issue of serious contention in the international community.
",
12987,1,," non-proliferation treaties exist within the united nations, and between countries, such as between the united states and russia.
",
12988,1,," the most comprehensive, thenuclear non-proliferation treaty (npt), consists of a pledge by current nuclear weapon states to reduce their nuclear stockpiles and achieve nuclear disarmament in return for non-nuclear weapon states not developing such weapons.
",
12989,1,," while some countries and institutions are eager to see a reduction in nuclear weapon stockpiles, others are eagerly seeking to obtain them.
",
12990,1,," north korea recently developed their first functional nuclear weapon, and iran is often accused of attempting to develop their own.
",
12991,1,," such countries have met with international condemnation.
",
12992,1,," so far, despite the npt, those who were recognized as nuclear powers have not upheld there side of the bargain and disarmed.
",
12993,1,," this has led to the question of whether other countries should also have a right to nuclear armament.
",
12994,1,," those that are trying to prevent these regimes gaining nuclear weapons counter that despite slow progress the npt still applies.
",
12995,0,," they are worried that weapons developed by less wealthy states are more likely to fall into the hands of terrorists, either through a lack of secure facilities or through being sold.
",
12996,0,,"the nation-state is the fundamental building block of the international system , and is recognized as such in all international treaties and organizations .
",
12997,0,," states are recognized as having the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of nuclear deterrence .
",
12998,0,," often states lack the capacity to defend themselves with conventional weapons .
",
12999,0,," this is particularly true of poor and small states .
",
13000,0,," even wealthy , small states are susceptible to foreign attack , since their wealth can not make up for their lack of manpower .
",
13001,0,," with a nuclear deterrent , all states become equal in terms of ability to do harm to one another .
",
13002,0,," if a large state attempts to intimidate , or even invade a smaller neighbour , it will be unable to effectively cow it , since the small state will have the power to grievously wound , or even destroy , the would-be invader with a few well-placed nuclear missiles .
",
13003,0,," for example , the russian invasion of georgia inwould likely never have occurred , as russia would have thought twice when considering the potential loss of several of its cities it would need to exchange for a small piece of georgian territory .
",
13004,0,," clearly , nuclear weapons serve in many ways to equalize states irrespective of size , allowing them to more effectively defend themselves .
",
13005,0,," furthermore , countries will only use nuclear weapons in the vent of existential threat .
",
13006,0,," this is why , for example , north korea has not used nuclear weapons ; for it , like all other states , survival is the order of the day , and using nuclear weapons aggressively would spell its certain destruction .
",
13007,0,," countries will behave rationally with regard to the use of nuclear weapons , as they have done since their invention and initial proliferation .
",
13008,0,," weapons in the hands of more people will thus not result in the greater risk of their use .
",
13009,0,," the issues discussed in international forums are largely set by nuclear powers .
",
13010,0,," the permanent membership of the united nations security council , for example , is composed only of nuclear powers , the same states that had nuclear weapons at the end of world war ii .
",
13011,0,," if all countries possess nuclear weapons , they redress the imbalance with regard to international clout , at least to the extent to which military capacity shapes states ' interactions with each other .
",
13012,0,," furthermore , the current world order is grossly unfair , based on the historical anachronism of the post-world war ii era .
",
13013,0,," the nuclear powers , wanting to retain their position of dominance in the wake of the post-war chaos , sought to entrench their position , convincing smaller nations to sign up to non-proliferation agreements and trying to keep the nuclear club exclusive .
",
13014,0,," it is only right , in terms of fairness that states not allow themselves the ability to possess certain arms while denying that right to others .
",
13015,0,," likewise , it is unfair in that it denies states , particularly those incapable of building large conventional militaries , the ability to defend themselves , relegating them to an inferior status on the world stage .
",
13016,0,," to finally level the international playing field and allow equal treatment to all members of the congress of nations , states must have the right to develop nuclear weapons .
",
13017,0,," nuclear weapons create stability , described in the doctrine of mutually assured destruction , mad .
",
13018,0,," countries with nuclear weapons have no incentive to engage in open military conflict with one another ; all recognize that they will suffer destruction if they choose the path of war .
",
13019,0,," if countries have nuclear weapons , fighting simply becomes too costly .
",
13020,0,," this serves to defuse conflicts , and reduce the likelihood of the outbreak of war .
",
13021,0,," for example , the conflict between india and pakistan was defused by the acquisition of nuclear weapons by both sides .
",
13022,0,," before they obtained nuclear weapons , they fought three wars that claimed millions of lives .
",
13023,0,," relations between the two states , while still far from cordial , have never descended into open war .
",
13024,0,," the defusing of the immediate tension of war , has given the chance for potential dialogue .
",
13025,0,," a similar dynamic has been played out a number of times in the past , and as of yet there has never been a war between two nuclear powers .
",
13026,0,," when states have nuclear weapons they can not fight , making the world a more peaceful place .
",
13027,0,," when nuclear deterrence is an acknowledged right of states , they will necessarily be less concealing of their capability , as the deterrent effect works only because it is visible and widely known .
",
13028,0,," knowledge of states ' nuclear capability allows greater regulation and cooperation in development of nuclear programs from developed countries with more advanced nuclear programs .
",
13029,0,," developed countries can help construct and maintain the nuclear weapons of other countries , helping to guarantee the safety protocols of countries ' programs are suitably robust .
",
13030,0,," this will cause a diminution in clandestine nuclear weapons programs , and will reduce the chances of weapons-grade material falling into the hands of terrorists .
",
13031,0,," thus , greater openness and freedom in the development of nuclear weapons will increase the security of nuclear stockpiles .
",
13032,1,,"the relationship between the media and democracy is controversial.
",
13033,1,," the media always claim they just “inform the public” whilst critics claim they actually shape public opinion, thereby “controlling” democracy.
",
13034,1,," one possible way in which this happens is through opinion polls.
",
13035,1,," in an opinion poll, an organization, such as a political party, a research company or a media company, questions a representative panel of citizens (usually about 1000) about their opinions on a political subject or about candidates.
",
13036,1,," very often polls ask people how they would vote if there were an election today, and the media uses the results to project the share of the national vote that different parties would achieve.
",
13037,1,," such polls are very common in the period of an election campaign, when five or more different surveys may be published in a week, and the results are picked over in detail by political commentators.
",
13038,1,,"different countries take different attitudes to the role of opinion polls in a democracy.
",
13039,1,," many impose no limitations on the publication of polls in the media, but some, including france, south korea, mexico and taiwan, ban the publication of opinion polls in the days running up to a national election.
",
13040,1,," in france, for example, the media cannot publish opinion polls of voting intention in the week before each round of national voting.
",
13041,1,," the issue of opinion polls is particularly controversial in india where the election commission used to ban the publication of opinion polls in the days before and during national elections which are conducted over a period of some twenty days in five regional days of voting.
",
13042,1,," in 1999, the indian supreme court overturned this rule following a challenge brought by a newspaper.
",
13043,1,," however, today the main political parties have joined with the election commission in an attempt to reintroduce the ban.
",
13044,1,," a similar situation exists in canada where restrictions on the publication of opinion polls were overturned in its supreme court in 1998.
",
13045,1,,"it might be useful to focus the debate by determining what type of opinion polls are harming the democratic process: opinion polls about general subjects, polls projecting the outcome of elections before election-day, or exit-polls (which ask actual voters how they have cast their ballot) on election-day.
",
13046,1,," there could be a variety of choices for a particular plan and the debate which follows only offers one possible method.
",
13047,1,,"   likewise, the debate could occur primarily at the value level addressing the general influence of opinion polls on the democratic process.
",
13048,1,,"   the democratic process could include a variety of ways that citizens participate or are informed prior to the selection of policies and candidates.
",
13049,1,,"  in particular, harm to the democratic process should be addressed with some specificity if it is argued that harm occurs.
",
13050,1,,"  with the proliferation of public messages and the increased use of various media to carry those messages, the relationship of public opinion polls to democratic dialogue challenges the exploration of voter choices and the information on which those choices are made.
",
13051,0,," in democratic nations public opinion matters as it is the public who ultimately decides who wins office and opinion polls measure that opinion .
",
13052,0,," as a result politicians have become obsessed with the shifting whims of public opinion upon which the media focuses forcing politicians also focus on popular opinion even between elections .
",
13053,0,," since the media carries the news , the active use of opinion polls by the media drives the policy agenda .
",
13054,0,," lack of information on critical issues is likely to result as politicians focus only on areas where the opinion polls highlight .
",
13055,0,," democracy is also harmed by the publication of opinion polls as subsequent citizen voter behaviour can be influenced .
",
13056,0,," when , for example , an opinion poll portrays a huge majority for a certain subject , or for a particular party , its opponents might be less vocal since they feel `` outnumbered '' or that decisions have already been made thus diminishing democratic dialogue .
",
13057,0,," undecided voters may be apathetic toward the election process since they appear to be a foregone conclusion .
",
13058,0,," the potential influence on voters choices is the reason the france forbids opinion polls shortly before an election .
",
13059,0,," since opinion polls are the products of research , they can also be heavily manipulated by the organization performing or commissioning the poll in question .
",
13060,0,," a bias can easily be created by selecting a certain target group , such as aap opinion poll which asked more democrats than republicans , or more usually through asking certain questions or phrasing them in a particular way .
",
13061,0,," for example it has been found that americans are more likely to support spending for the ` poor ' than for ` welfare ' .
",
13062,0,," this information can generate false information and untrue or exaggerated claims .
",
13063,0,," even if the research is done with an objective mindset , the research technique or reporting method can skew the results .
",
13064,0,," for example , the opinion polls seldom report the measure of uncertainty of the conclusions , by for example reporting standards deviations from means , sample size , etc, these measures are usually not published .
",
13065,0,," reporting the results of opinion polls without further statistical information leads to more misinformation .
",
13066,0,," one such example comes from the exit polls of theu.
",
13067,0,,"s. presidential election .
",
13068,0,," many of the election polls predicted a win for kerry , but did n't consider the fact that republicans were less likely to respond to an exit poll leading to inaccurate conclusions about what would occur .
",
13069,0,," thus , opinion polls are not necessarily trustworthy sources of information on which voters can make good decisions .
",
13070,0,," tactical voting is the purposeful casting of votes to sway an outcome .
",
13071,0,," when the outcome is predicted in an opinion poll , it can influence voters to possibly cast a ballot differently than had that poll information not existed .
",
13072,0,," this means that the votes are being cast based upon inaccurate assumptions .
",
13073,0,," for instance , in theu.
",
13074,0,,"k. elections all polls predicted a labour victory .
",
13075,0,," however , against all expectations , the conservatives won .
",
13076,0,," it is wholly possible that many people , ensured of a seeming labour victory , then decided to vote for the conservatives tactically to ensure that there would be a balance in the house of commons -- or even out of sympathy , the ` underdog effect ' .
",
13077,0,," or decided to vote for their first preference minor party , such as the liberal democrats , because they believed the conservatives would be voted out without their needing to cast their votes tactically for labour .
",
13078,0,," thus , it is possible that the voters did n't accomplish the government they actually wanted , as they cast votes based on opinion polls .
",
13079,0,," the unintended outcomes are a result of these opinion polls and tactical voting .
",
13080,0,," this would ensure a more democratic discussion immediately prior to the decision making process of voting .
",
13081,0,," this does not harm free expression because it is serving a specific purpose at a specific time .
",
13082,0,," for instance , during times of national security or disaster certain citizen behaviour is restricted .
",
13083,0,," since there is information on public opinion in all of the other weeks of the year , this two week moratorium would solve some of the harms of published opinion polls .
",
13084,0,," there would be less stifling of discussion , voters would not be subjected to possibly biased information or misused statistics at this critical time of thinking and making a wise choice .
",
13085,0,," tactical voting is likely to be used less , and minority voices are not as likely to be overshadowed by popularly `` claimed '' opinions .
",
13086,0,," therefore , we propose that opinion polls not be publishedweeks prior to an election .
",
13087,0,," when opinion polls become the constant focus of the media , politicians are forced to pander to an ever-changing public marketplace instead of developing a consistent party or personal philosophy .
",
13088,0,," candidates become overly involved in defending and explaining poll data .
",
13089,0,," voters become the consumers of political marketing .
",
13090,0,," the democratic process is diminished when changing opinion polls interrupts substantive dialogue .
",
13091,0,," without the excessive use of poll data , a candidate 's message can be more than an advertisement .
",
13092,0,," rather than the marketing of a person , important political ideas and public policy discussion occur .
",
13093,0,," even though poll data would be available during the earlier election season , a plan to control opinion polls would begin to diminish such a focus .
",
13094,0,," the advantage would be less political marketing and room for better democratic discussion .
",
13095,1,,"“we do not negotiate with terrorists.”
",
13096,1,," this is something we regularly hear, both in movies, and from governments.
",
13097,1,," in the hostage situation the gas field at amenas in january 2013, algeria communication minister mohamed said repeated algeria’s determination “we say that in the face of terrorism, yesterday as today as tomorrow, there will be no negotiation, no blackmail, no respite in the struggle against terrorism”.
",
13098,1,," algeria’s determination was in part due to its long history of terrorism in the country including a civil war fromtoin which up to 200,000 died against islamist groups such as the islamic salvation front (who had won an election).
",
13099,1,," the war was a guerrilla campaign and there were numerous massacres on both sides, not something that encourages a moderate attitude.
",
13100,1,," yet part of the reasoning may also have been that the terrorists in question were only threatening western hostages, they had said they only wanted the christians and infidels so the algerians in the gas complex were safe – possibly not the best way to coerce the algerian government.
",
13101,1,,"so what is a terrorist?
",
13102,1,," while there is no comprehensive definition that is recognised by everyone the united states defines international terrorism as activities that“(a) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the united states or of any state;(b) appear to be intended—(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and(c) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum;”c can be ignored as the question of whether to negotiate applies equally to domestic as international terrorism.
",
13103,1,," from the definition however the size of the attack does not matter, it can range from a stabbing in woolwich to the attack on the two towers or bigger.
",
13104,1,,"the key point of the definition is that the terrorists want something from the government and are using violent means to get it.
",
13105,1,," this means that there is clearly something that could be the subject of negotiation.
",
13106,1,," often the demands are not proportionate or the government is not in a position to answer the demands.
",
13107,1,," in the algerian example mentioned above the demands included an end to the french action in mali, something that the algerian government has no power over and would an immense demand if negotiating with the french government.
",
13108,1,," the other demands by the hostage takers was the release of islamists from algerian prisons and a safe corridor to the malian border, both are much more achievable by the algerians even if unpalatable.
",
13109,1,," this then could have been the basis of a negotiation.
",
13110,0,," almost all terrorist groups kill people , whether innocents or members of the military .
",
13111,0,," even those who limit casualties by giving warnings of their atrocities are unperturbed when they do end up taking lives .
",
13112,0,," negotiation can then be the best way to save lives both in the short and long term .
",
13113,0,," in the short term negotiating can mean a cease fire , and if there are hostages their release .
",
13114,0,," over the long term negotiation is necessary if there is to be any peaceful conclusion to the conflict .
",
13115,0,," as the right to life is the most fundamental right , and the duty of the states to protect its citizens is primary role of the state it is clear that the protection of these lives should be the main consideration for the state .
",
13116,0,," when fighting terrorists the state either needs to answer some of the terrorists demands or fight back .
",
13117,0,," when the state fights back the by the terrorists response is almost always more bloodshed using more and more extreme methods for example the first intifada was fought using sticks and stones , but when this , and the peace process that followed it failed , or rather did not show the results that was hoped for , the second was a major step up to suicide bombing .
",
13118,0,," this is because when the terrorists fail they are unlikely to pack up ; instead they will try to find a bigger lever to course the state into making the move they want .
",
13119,0,," in this case arafat hoped a round of violence would bring about concessions .
",
13120,0,," the best way to prevent this cycle of violence is to negotiate , even if this is mostly to buy time .
",
13121,0,," even when there is no cease fire there will be no reason for the terrorists to escalate if their demands are being taken seriously .
",
13122,0,," in every terrorist movement there are different factions and disagreements about how best to achieve their collective aims , and often terrorist groups have either direct or indirect ties with political parties with whom they share the same goals .
",
13123,0,," it is clearly then in the interest of the state to strengthen the more acceptable parts of the movement whether can seriously talk to .
",
13124,0,," the only way to strengthen the moderates is to negotiate .
",
13125,0,," this then makes their path to a solution the more credible course for the movement as a whole to take .
",
13126,0,," to demonstrate a negative example the united states and israel were unwilling to negotiate with moderates within the plo for fifteen years during which time not only was there a lot more bloodshed but much more radical groups formed on the palestinian side making negotiations much more complicated in the long run as there would be multiple groups who would need to sign up to a final peace treaty .
",
13127,0,," un secretary general kofi annan stated in`` terrorism will only be defeated if we act to solve the political disputes and long-standing conflicts which generate support for it .
",
13128,0,," if we do not , we shall find ourselves acting as a recruiting sergeant for the very terrorists we seek to suppress . ''
",
13129,0,," terrorist campaigns do n't just come out of nowhere , with the exception of some single individual acts , there is a grievance behind the acts .
",
13130,0,," the terrorist is trying to have this grievance dealt with and believes the best way to this end is through violence .
",
13131,0,," it is clear that the easiest way to end the conflict is simply to resolve the grievance .
",
13132,0,," even when there are no negotiations the state will usually attempt to resolve some of these grievances , however doing so unilaterally will simply show that the terrorist 's violence is working without getting any guarantees of an end to the violence in return .
",
13133,0,," negotiation therefore benefits both sides .
",
13134,0,," it is notable that% of terrorist groups that have ended sincehave done so as a result of negotiations compared to only% being defeated militarily .
",
13135,0,," just as negotiations strengthen the moderates they isolate those who are most radical and interested in a violent solution .
",
13136,0,," this isolation is key to actually winning a fight against groups using terrorist methods because terrorists are almost always hiding within the community .
",
13137,0,," the only way to prevent these acts is therefore to encourage their community to persuade the terrorists to reject violence , or if they are not willing to change to aid the state .
",
13138,0,," the need for help from the community is recognised in almost all conflicts against terrorist groups and insurgencies .
",
13139,0,," the state succeeds when it gets the moderates on board , this is shown by the conflict in iraq where the united states turned the tide against al qaeda in the al-anbar awakening .
",
13140,0,," this victory was only made possible through the engagement and cooperation with local leaders who wanted an end to violence so were willing to talk to , and join with the us military if the result was likely to be security .
",
13141,1,,"the united states initiated military operations in libya in early march of 2011, with a broad international coalition under nato command, in order to defend civilians engaging in a popular revolution against muammar gadaffi.
",
13142,1,," the brutal suppression and murder of these civilians by gadaffi's regime led to calls by the arab league for nato action as well as un resolution 1973, which authorized the limited mission of protecting libyan civilians with a no-fly zone.
",
13143,1,," the us and nato attempted to execute this mandate by bombing select pro-qaddafi forces and munitions and maintaining air superiority over the country.
",
13144,1,," the us formally transferred command of these operations to nato on april 1st.
",
13145,1,," the conflict continued apace through june.
",
13146,1,," during this period, it became clear that the us and nato mission had extended beyond simply protecting civilians to regime change.
",
13147,1,," this has included the active military support of anti-gadaffi forces as well as targeted bombing campaigns.
",
13148,1,," an international debate has followed these events.
",
13149,1,," many in the us have claimed that president obama needed congressional approval afterdays of the conflict, in accordance with the war powers act.
",
13150,1,," but the president has argued that this law, passed in the wake of the vietnam war, does not apply because us engagement does not rise to the level of ""hostilities"" contemplated by the law.
",
13151,1,," other questions concern whether the war has extended beyond the un mandate and whether the engagement is even worthwhile for nato, the us, and the wider world.
",
13152,0,," the pros and cons in this contentious debate are considered below.
",
13153,0,,"there are multiple arguments indicating why the u.s. might be engaged in hostilities under the war powers act , enough so that this single argument could make an entire two person case .
",
13154,0,," the u.s. has engaged in sustained hostilities in libya which have resulted in regime change within the country .
",
13155,0,," the president himself admits that causing regime change would be unjustifiable in his speech justifying the war by pledging that `` broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake . ''
",
13156,0,," 2 however , regime change was the result of the mission and nato and u.s. played a significant role in facilitating that change .
",
13157,0,," secondly , the war powers act covers the u.s. fighting in a supportive role in wars .
",
13158,0,," `` for purposes of this chapter , the term ` introduction of united states armed forces ' includes the assignment of members of such armed forces to command , coordinate , participate in the movement of , or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged , or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will become engaged , in hostilities . ''
",
13159,0,," 3 hence the u.s. is acting in violation of this condition .
",
13160,0,," further , troops do not need to be on the ground to call the libyan engagement hostilities .
",
13161,0,," u.s. men and women have firstly died in the conflict , but secondly if troops were needed on the ground for a war , a u.s. president could potentially fire a thousand missiles at a country without the engagement being considered a war .
",
13162,0,," further , even though the u.s. gave powers to nato , it maintained a lead role in this coalition force .
",
13163,0,," as such , the engagement should still be subject to u.s. laws and rules .
",
13164,0,," finally , the sheer cost of the engagement to the u.s. taxpayer implies that it should be considered a war .
",
13165,0,," the cost of the war has been more than $million per day .1 firstly , libya did not attack us soldiers and did not harm us citizens .
",
13166,0,," given that this is true , then engagement with libya to begin with goes against the spirit of us law .
",
13167,0,," given that the situation is not an emergency for the u.s. circumventing congress in order to prosecute the war is incredibly harmful as it undermines one of the core institutions in u.s. democracy .
",
13168,0,," further , the use of international organisations such as the un and nato to circumvent congress has bad ramifications for the future as in doing this the u.s. government has significantly lowered the burden required to go to war should it wish to do so in the future .
",
13169,0,," this is problematic because the decision to go to war should never be one that is taken lightly .
",
13170,0,," should the u.s. wish to go to war again then it might end up in a situation such as vietnam , the conflict that inspired the creation of the war powers act .1 firstly , the un intervention in libya wrongly rests on nato authority .
",
13171,0,," the use of nato to circumvent congressional approval in this situation violates the initial agreement regarding the participation of the u.s. in nato that was ratified by congress .
",
13172,0,," as such , even if the u.s. is legitimate in going to war and the circumvention of war powers can be justified , the circumvention using nato can not .
",
13173,0,," secondly , the use of un approval to circumvent congress means that the un charter and the ideals of the un have been placed by the government at a higher level of value than of the us constitution .
",
13174,0,," if this is the case then the government has undermined the validity of the us constitution and through doing that has undermined all laws within the u.s. which is harmful should the u.s. wish to project power in a way that is contrary to the un 's wishes .1
",
13175,1,,"the european parliament is a directly elected body that covers all european union members.
",
13176,1,," it hasmembers who are elected once every five years.
",
13177,1,," unusually for a parliament the system for the election of meps is not uniform across the union because this, within guidelines such as all using proportional representation, is left up to the member states to decide.
",
13178,1,," the biggest difference is that some countries have the whole country as one large constituency, such as germany or austria, while others split themselves into constituencies each with several mep’s, ireland for example has four constituencies with three meps representing each.
",
13179,1,," but there are many smaller differences too; some countries vote for individuals and others for party lists, some require a gender balance, some use electronic voting, and even the day on which voting takes place is not uniform.
",
13180,1,," of greater importance for the voter there are large differences in the number of citizens who are represented by each mep; from theelections germany will havemeps and maltasince germany has a population ofmillion against malta’s 400,000 it has one for every 854,000 inhabitants against malta’s one mep per 66,000.
",
13181,1,,"elections for the european parliament historically have low turnouts and it has been declining; inturnout was 61.99% but this had fallen to 43% in 2009.
",
13182,1,," as the legitimacy of a parliament is based on a democratic mandate low turnouts damage the legitimacy of the european parliament.
",
13183,1,," it is therefore right to explore possible ways of raising the turnout, both in terms of the number of registered electors voting and in terms of the total electorate.
",
13184,1,," the main response from the parliament is to provide better information about what it does to voters and how it affects voters’ lives; something that is made possible by the increasing powers the parliament has.
",
13185,1,," however the european parliament could think bigger and as such there have been calls for the eu to lower the voting age toin order to increase turnout as well as “improve intergenerational dialogue” and allow “young europeans… to have rights matching their duties”.
",
13186,0,,"   it is ridiculous and clearly unfair that some sixteen year olds should get to vote in an election while most are barred from participating .
",
13187,0,," this is the case in european parliament elections at the moment ; young people in austria are able to vote in elections atwhile everyone else has to wait until they are eighteen .
",
13188,0,," this means that a tiny minority of the youth in the european union get to vote before the rest something which is clearly discrimination against the majority of the european union 'sandyear olds ; ` universal suffrage ' should be universal for the european parliament across the whole of the union .
",
13189,0,," the age should therefore be lowered to sixteen so that voting age is universally recognised with no one group receiving the right to vote before the others .
",
13190,0,," the number of different elections can be confusing ; almost everyone has three , european , national , and local , and some have others added in such as mayoral , or regional elections .
",
13191,0,," as such there is much to be gained from helping to differentiate elections by not being concerned about being allowed to vote for them all at the same age .
",
13192,0,," having elections for the european parliament at the age ofwould clearly distinguish the elections from all the other elections within the country , with the exception of austria .
",
13193,0,," for the european union this would be an opportunity to show that it cares for the youth vote and has their issues at heart as it is a chance to get teenagers involved in europe before they can be involved in their own national elections .
",
13194,0,," for the teenagers it provides a chance to engage with one election , and one electoral system , before all the others helping to keep things simple .
",
13195,0,," young people are not well represented in european national parliaments either in terms of the membership of those parliaments or the policies they produce .
",
13196,0,," the average age in the bundestag isand it is similar in most parliaments .
",
13197,0,," youth unemployment in europe for the fourth quarter ofwas 23.2 % , almost twice the unemployment rate as a whole .
",
13198,0,," this is because many countries do not implement youth friendly policies ; northern countries like germany are determined to impose austerity which increases unemployment , while southern countries when implementing reforms are not implementing labour reforms that would loosen the security of permanent workers in return for reducing unemployment .
",
13199,0,," this may in part be a result of demographics in europe .
",
13200,0,," europe is aging ; in19.3 % of the eu's population was underwhile 13.9 % over, bythis had changed to 15.6 % underand 17.5 % over.
",
13201,0,," with an increasing contingent of elderly , who are anyway more likely to vote , the influence of young voters is declining .
",
13202,0,," reducing the voting age will help to redress this imbalance .
",
13203,0,," there would be clear advantages in having elections while young people are still in school as school could help prepare them for the elections .
",
13204,0,," schools would be able to teach their students in advance what the ballot is like , about the process of voting , and most importantly about the european union and the function of the european parliament .
",
13205,0,," one of the biggest problems with the european parliament is that voters do n't understand what it does .
",
13206,0,," to take a couple of basics from a eurobarometer poll in,% of european citizens did not know meps were directly elected and% did not know that they sit in the parliament according to ideology not nationality .
",
13207,0,," this shows how necessary education about the european parliament is .
",
13208,0,," having elections atprovides an ideal opportunity as it means that most will participate in a european election while they are at school .
",
13209,0,," teaching about why voting matters would also help to improve turnout .
",
13210,0,," when austria reduced its voting age toit was found that turnout from 16-17 year olds was significantly higher than turnout for 18-19 year olds when both groups are first time voters .
",
13211,0,," this suggests thatmay simply be the wrong time to introduce people to voting for the first time .
",
13212,0,," since voting or not voting tends to be habit forming lowering the voting age could slowly increase turnout across the board .
",
13213,0,," throughout the european union in the parliament elections there is a problem with protest voting .
",
13214,0,," indeed studies have found that almost% of votes in european parliament elections are protest votes ; this is clearly bad for the european parliament as these are not the parties that the electorate really want when it comes to creating policy .
",
13215,0,," it reflects the fact that voters do n't believe that their vote for the european parliament matters .
",
13216,0,," yet because voting atis two years earlier than voting in most national elections voting for the european parliament will beandyear olds first experience of voting ; as they did not vote for the government they are much less likely to be using their vote simply as a protest against the national government .
",
13217,0,," this is because it will be clear that they are not voting on the basis of national issues because they ca n't vote at that level .
",
13218,0,," this then represents a good chance for parties to get their european policies across to the youngest voters so that they know what their vote at the european level means .
",
13219,1,,"think tanks are a modern phenomenon, where high profiling intellectuals are given a free role to discover, investigate and solve important issues in order to affect public policy.
",
13220,1,," the purpose of a think tank is to provide expert advice and ideas on economic or political problems; usually a think tank has a particular area of expertise and focuses their study on that area.
",
13221,1,," their purpose is then not to propagate a political agenda but to look at facts, ideas, and possible new policies.
",
13222,1,," in practice however this results in particular think tanks promoting policies that have a particular political orientation.
",
13223,1,,"despite the political leanings of some think tanks are often elevated to a status of impartial enlightenment and their voice has great impact on the paradigm and on public discourse.
",
13224,1,," they publish academic material, hold seminars, and appear as authorities on particular areas in the media.
",
13225,1,," however, lately, voices are being raised calling for their increased transparency on their sources of funding.
",
13226,1,," of particular note the eu administration and anti-fraud commissioner siim kallas argued that as think tanks play a clear role in eu policymaking they should sign up to the european commission's voluntary lobbyists register.
",
13227,1,," this would not require complete details of their funding but would require they “declare the interests, objectives or aims promoted and, where applicable, specify the clients or members whom they represent”.
",
13228,1,,"the model for think tanks disclosing their funders would require organisations to make public all contributions that constitute a significant portion of the organisations’ budget.
",
13229,1,," this can take the form of a percentage, e.g. 1% of their budget.
",
13230,1,," this would make them unable to receive anonymous donations over this sum.
",
13231,1,," the major funders would then have to be disclosed along with any research they funded and would be on the think tank’s website.
",
13232,0,," democracies rely on transparency .
",
13233,0,," our commitment to transparency means surrendering part of our autonomy for the collective .
",
13234,0,," this does not mean that our autonomy does not still belong to us ; the institutions that affect our lives are under a constant obligation to justify their decisions and existence in relation to us .
",
13235,0,," i do not have a right to know everything about the local football club , if i do n't play football and they are not a public company their decisions do n't affect me .
",
13236,0,," think tanks , however , are highly influential , and directly affect the society in which we live : some have , for example , lobbied successfully against action to prevent global warming .
",
13237,0,," therefore they are to be considered a power in society , and the principle of transparency must be extended to them .
",
13238,0,," think tanks are considered more credible than corporate marketing .
",
13239,0,," in the case of corporate marketing the recipient is aware that he is being sold a product .
",
13240,0,," in the case of think tanks , the recipient believes he is being given unbiased information .
",
13241,0,," therefore , it is tempting for corporations to finance think tanks and encourage them to reach the conclusions that they otherwise would promote through marketing .
",
13242,0,," this way , think tanks can be powerful tools for promoting a biased agenda : if done successfully the same message is communicated but in the form of credible information rather than manipulative marketing .
",
13243,0,," in fact , it is common practice for journalists to quote think tanks without labelling their political bias .
",
13244,0,," and they most certainly do n't say if there is funding from a particular interest for example with the supposedly free market institute of public affairs in australia that somehow ends up arguing for government investment and intervention in northern australia -- a position suspiciously close to several big mining companies .
",
13245,0,," this violates people 's freedom to make an informed decision , and can give biased views disproportionate and undue influence .
",
13246,0,," by forcing them to disclose , any corruption or bias will become obvious to all .
",
13247,0,," non-disclosure can be perceived as objectivity .
",
13248,0,," it is easier for the public to criticise a think tank that is openly associated with a particular funder .
",
13249,0,," that kind of prejudice is stronger than the more general the prejudice against non-disclosure .
",
13250,0,," a person might distrust a non-transparent think tank , but dislike a think tank that is funded by an organisation they are already prejudiced towards .
",
13251,0,," in any comparison between two such organisations the distrusted organisation will have greater impact than the disliked organisation .
",
13252,0,," this gives non-transparent think tanks an advantage over transparent and honest ones .
",
13253,0,," billionaires are then able to buy influence by secretly funding organisations such as the global warming policy foundation or the institute of economic affairs that is then listened to , by the media and therefore the public , when their own views would simply be dismissed due to the personal motivations of the backers .
",
13254,0,," by forcing all think tanks to reveal their funding , we level the playing field .
",
13255,0,," even think tanks benefit from the introduction of this policy .
",
13256,0,," the status quo leaves disclosure as a strategic device : think tanks are unwilling to disclose more than their competition for fear of being unfavourably portrayed .
",
13257,0,," such negative competition , i.e. competition in factors that do not improve the products of the market , makes them unable to make rational decisions about their funding if , for instance , potential funders want to contribute only on the condition that this funding be made public .
",
13258,0,," as a consequence , the advent of organisations who call for transparency has been praised by prominent think tanks like the new economics foundation .
",
13259,0,," by depriving everybody of the strategic tool of revealing none or only a part of their funding , think tanks can not be pressured into hiding or providing certain information about their funders , and they can thus act more independently .
",
13260,0,," in the status quo , the ability of think tanks to be non-transparent potentially provides a framework for criminal groups , or in extreme cases organisations , to handle large amounts of money without revealing where their money comes from or goes .
",
13261,0,," we are allowing extremist groups to be exempt from answering to the government or shareholders in their management of money or information .
",
13262,0,," in the us and canada , think tanks are also exempt from tax .
",
13263,0,," by this mechanism , false think tanks can be used , for example , to channel money from openly extremist groups that could otherwise not access those parts of the world .
",
13264,1,,"elections are the lifeblood of all democracies; they are where the people have the chance to make their choice of government, often after years where their only real influence has been through protest and the media.
",
13265,1,," yet not all countries that have elections are really democratic.
",
13266,1,," elections have become close to universal with many countries that are ‘autocratic’ also having elections just like any democracy.
",
13267,1,," these elections are often a sham in the sense that there is no real chance of there being a change in government as a result of the vote.
",
13268,1,," thus we might consider there to be another criteria beyond simply holding elections that determines if a country is truly democratic; whether the elections they hold are ‘free and fair’.
",
13269,1,,"in the declaration on free and fair elections the inter-parliamentary council set out numerous conditions for elections qualifying as free and fair including:“voting rightsparty rightsresponsibilities of states… to guarantee the rights and institutional framework for periodic and genuine, free and fair elections”there are many ways in which there may be elections within an autocratic setting.
",
13270,1,," in a few cases the ‘democratic element’ is purely for show; qatar is from this year (2013) holding elections (currently suspended due to a handover of power) for its advisory council but as an advisory body it is clear the real power will remain with the emir.
",
13271,1,," it is much more usual that the ruling party simply ensures that the opposition can never get enough seats to form a majority.
",
13272,1,," this may be done in several different ways.
",
13273,1,," in burma (myanmar) for example the national league for democracy faces a parliament where many of the seats are not contested in elections, in the house of representatives the ruling union solidarity and development party hasseats, of whichwere directly appointed.
",
13274,1,," the main opposition the national league for democracy wonout of theseats it contested in byelections showing that it would likely win if there were an election without restrictions.
",
13275,1,," alternatively as in zimbabwe there may be intimidation and violence in the elections themselves.
",
13276,1,," or the results may be determined in advance through ballot stuffing, vote rigging, and bussing in supporters so they vote several times as occurs in russia.
",
13277,1,," the methods may be different but the outcome is the same; certain victory for the ruling party.
",
13278,0,," holding sham elections is fundamentally dishonest as it is asking the people to choose a government and then ignoring their choice .
",
13279,0,," not holding elections is at least honestly telling the people that they get no say in who is in power .
",
13280,0,," holding a sham election inevitably means having to lie to the people somewhere along the line ; whether it is in preventing people registering , or voting , or in manipulating the results .
",
13281,0,," the people usually know the result is a sham or at least are suspicious -- in the latest zimbabwean election the headlines in the newspapers included `` zanu-pf gloats over victory '' .
",
13282,0,," without a sham election the government can at least be honest with their people so enabling a level of trust or even a kind of contract between the two -- the government and the people each lets the other get on with it .
",
13283,0,," thus for example in china trust in government inwas% against the world average of% .
",
13284,0,," it is hard to see what the benefit of an election that can change nothing is , but there are certainly all the costs associated with a normal election .
",
13285,0,," elections can be costly in financial terms , the united states elections cost several billion dollars but even much smaller and less extravagant elections need financing .
",
13286,0,," zimbabwe 's elections inforced the government to ask its neighbours for $million to carry out the polls , for a nation that is essentially bankrupt this is a lot of money .
",
13287,0,," another cost is uncertainty .
",
13288,0,," in fully democratic elections the uncertainty is with what the policies will be when the government changes .
",
13289,0,," with sham elections the uncertainty is whether the elections will be a focus for violence .
",
13290,0,," sometimes this is during campaigning itself as with zimbabwe inwhere up topeople were killed .
",
13291,0,," otherwise violence occurs when there is a perception that an election has been stolen so the green movement in iran took to the streets and was met with a violent crackdown in.
",
13292,0,," democracy and elections are about popularity but popular decisions are not always the right ones .
",
13293,0,," even mature democracies have sometimes seen their government 's make use of the levers of government to boost their electoral chances ; for example margaret thatcher 's government stoked the economy in the lawson boom inwhich just happened to be an election year .
",
13294,0,," governments without elections can engage in long term planning and make unpopular decisions without fear of the consequences .
",
13295,0,," thus for example saudi arabia is willing to pump less oil , and so get less money in the short term at least , in order to create stability in the oil market by having enough excess capacity to prevent price spikes .
",
13296,0,," not having any elections -- or only elections for a powerless advisory parliament -- may actually have a benefit in putting responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the rulers .
",
13297,0,," only a country that is comparatively well governed , or successful , can manage without a democratic safety valve .
",
13298,0,," it is notable that the remaining absolute monarchies or those where the king rules as well as reigns are mostly very wealthy petro states .
",
13299,0,," several of the remaining communist regimes , china and vietnam , rely on rapid economic growth to cement their legitimacy combined with meritocracy in their selection of leaders .
",
13300,0,," in both cases there is an incentive for good governance by those in power as they are in for the long term .
",
13301,0,," the leaders know they are not going to be elected out of office so have the motivation to reduce corruption and create long term growth through investment in infrastructure because this will benefit them in the future .
",
13302,1,,"conscription refers to the compulsory enrolment of citizens to national service.
",
13303,1,," national service does not always include military service but traditionally revolves around the prospect or existence of a state of war.
",
13304,1,," the object of conscription is to permit the mass recruitment of young men and women, in times of need, to come to the aid of the state.
",
13305,1,," of the contemporary examples of conscription being used, the vietnam is perhaps most infamous for its popular images of american conscientious objectors burning their draft cards in objection to the war's justifications.
",
13306,1,," conscription was subsequently abolished in the united states in 1973, but it remains in many states, such as finland and austria in the developed world and mexico and thailand in the developing world, as a bulwark against potential aggression.
",
13307,1,," proponents also argue that conscription benefits the citizens enlisted, encouraging their patriotism and teaching them invaluable life skills.
",
13308,0,," opponents respond that the lives of one's citizens cannot be used as property to use in times of war and that regardless, there are economic disincentives to conscription.
",
13309,0,,"national service helps to promote patriotism and a sense of nationhood .
",
13310,0,," in many countries national pride is at an all-time low in the wake of recent the financial crash and resulting austerity budgets and this gives us the chance to rally around a shared cause , no matter what race or culture you come from .
",
13311,0,," the individual has a duty to put something back into society and national service allows this .
",
13312,0,," whether it be through protecting the country or helping with social or environmental projects , this encourages the idea of working as a community instead of merely for selfish ends .
",
13313,0,," even when not in active service , the mere knowledge that one is trained and , at a moment 's notice , deployable to the front line in the protection of one 's society and way of life promotes a wonderful togetherness .
",
13314,0,," an example of this is the irish in world war i. although they were only recruited as volunteers even nationalists signed up .
",
13315,0,," a nationalist mp john redmond described it as ' a distinctively irish army , composed of irishmen , led by irishmen and trained at home in ireland ' ` the achievements of that irish army have covered ireland with glory before the world ' , this was in stark contrast to the disillusionment and risings nationalists back in ireland were participating in .
",
13316,0,,"  a volunteer army , often separated from society at large and operating as a ` state within a state ' , does not serve such purposes so easily .
",
13317,0,," in the military , young men acquire many skills for everyday life .
",
13318,0,," these include personality traits like self-discipline , teamwork and leadership and practical skills like first aid , driving an ambulance , extra practice for surgeons , swimming , etc. that might be beneficial either to their own careers or , in cases of emergency , to everyone as these skills are transferable .
",
13319,0,," as william james once wrote about national service , ` our gilded youths would be drafted off to get the childishness knocked out of them , and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas ' .
",
13320,0,,"  furthermore it acts as a test of manhood .
",
13321,0,," as ann marlowe points out , ` if we showed all of our young people a closer look at danger , if we forced them into some form of self-testing , perhaps we would not only give them a sense of greater purpose , but also strip the false glamour from depictions of cruelty and destructruction .
",
13322,0,,"  we accept the need for national service in wartime and this is just an extension of this .
",
13323,0,," conscription during peacetime would mean that the country was prepared for emergencies when they happened , rather than having to prepare after the fact .
",
13324,0,," as us congressman charles rangel has argued , the fairest way of ensuring that all share in the sacrifice is a military draft , poutvaara & wagener  p..
",
13325,0,,"  it would ensure that at the time of a military conflict the state has enough trained troops , therefore the security of that state is enhanced - a benefit every citizen can enjoy .
",
13326,0,," the philosopher john rawls believed similarly , arguing ` conscription is permissible only if it is demanded for the defence of liberty itself ' , carter  p..
",
13327,0,,"  furthermore , it also acts as a potential deterrent against aggressive action , for the existence of a large pool of well-trained reserves is in principle little different to the existence of a large , well-trained standing army .
",
13328,0,," the cause of peace is well-served by a policy of conscription .
",
13329,0,,"  carter , a.  .
",
13330,0,," liberalism and the obligation to military service .
",
13331,0,," political studies , 68-81 .
",
13332,0,," conscription permits the state to raise , both cheaply and quickly , a large , able-bodied force ready for combat .
",
13333,0,," states with conscription-based armed services are able to prepare for combat without the expense of housing a large volunteer force .
",
13334,0,," furthermore , in the context of surprise attacks , conscription permits the instantaneous raising of a large , competent army .
",
13335,0,," a volunteer force faced with a sudden and extreme threat would not be able to raise , equip and prepare a sufficiently-powerful force within a similar time .
",
13336,0,," in, when faced with the threat of an arab alliance led by general nasser , israel was reliant on the swift mobilization of its conscripts in order to first deter and then repel the arab forces .
",
13337,0,," a volunteer force would likely have been slower to respond , less able to deter and incapable of repelling .
",
13338,0,," without conscription , a state leaves itself at the mercy of an enemy able to conceal its intentions and strike rapidly .
",
13339,1,,"the united states initiated operation enduring freedom on the 7th octoberless than a month after the attack on the world trade center and pentagon.
",
13340,1,," the taliban had been sheltering osama bin laden, the mastermind of those attacks, and refused to extradite him.
",
13341,1,," the conflict was swift with kabul falling on the 13th november to the northern alliance, a group who had been fighting the taliban and had us help.
",
13342,1,," bin laden however evaded the united states and escaped to pakistan but has since been killed.
",
13343,1,,"there was however a need to keep the peace and the international security assistance force was established in kabul ondecember 2001.
",
13344,1,," nato took over command of isaf onaugustand its mission was expanded to include the whole country.
",
13345,1,," unfortunately the united states and nato did not succeed in destroying the taliban who managed to regroup in pakistan and begin fighting again in afghanistan in 2003.
",
13346,1,," losses for nato and us forces in afghanistan reached a peak ofinand so far there have been a total offatalities.
",
13347,1,," casualty rates for civilians are of course many times higher with at leastsince 2005.
",
13348,1,," nato however is now getting out; on the 18th june the control over military operations in afghanistan was handed over to the afghanis and on the same day the taliban indicated a willingness to negotiate indicating that perhaps an end is in sight.
",
13349,1,," regardless of whether these negotiations go ahead nato intends to have mostly left the country by the end of 2014.
",
13350,1,," so it is a good time to consider if nato has been successful.
",
13351,1,,"what constitutes success for nato in afghanistan?
",
13352,1,," there are several different threads to what might be considered a success.
",
13353,1,," the most obvious are whether there has been success in the objectives set by the united states at the outset of the conflict and whether nato has succeeded in the remit of its mission in afghanistan.
",
13354,1,,"george bush initially stated that us actions were “designed to disrupt the use of afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the taleban regime.”
",
13355,1,," this is a very limited objective that could be said to have been rapidly met but it is not really the objective for having nato forces in afghanistan.
",
13356,1,,"annex i of the bonn agreement inthat established the international force in afghanistan recognised that “the responsibility for providing security and law and order throughout the country resides with the afghans themselves”.
",
13357,1,," the nato force was to “assist in the maintenance of security for kabul and its surrounding areas” and was later expanded to the rest of the country through un security council resolutionin 2003.
",
13358,1,," the only non-security element mentioned for the force was at the end “it would also be desirable if such a force were to assist in the rehabilitation of afghanistan’s infrastructure.”
",
13359,1,,"but while it is clearly the most important element just limiting the question to security does ignore other justifications for nato’s mission that have at various times been given; to ensure human rights, to enable the growth of democracy, and rebuilding the country all of which should be at least considered.
",
13360,0,," `` nato 's primary objective in afghanistan is to enable the afghan authorities to provide effective security across the country and ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists . ''
",
13361,0,," the invasion of afghanistan was initially about destroying al-qaeda and with the killing of osama bin laden inin pakistan this objective has been met .
",
13362,0,," there are still efforts to destroy al qaeda but these have mostly moved out of afghanistan and into pakistan and other countries such as yemen .
",
13363,0,," nato has also brought afghanistan to the point where the afghani 's can look after themselves and exercise their own security .
",
13364,0,," on 18th june afghanistan took over the lead from nato on security nationwide having previously been taking control district by district .
",
13365,0,," handing over security also itself improves security with afghanis in kandahar saying `` now that the foreigners are gone , the security situation in the city and in the districts is much better '' .
",
13366,0,," nato is also ensuring that peace and security remain in afghanistan as they draw down by opening up negotiations with the taliban .
",
13367,0,," peace can only be assured by bringing together the sides so that almost everyone accepts the status quo and does not want to destroy that status quo through force .
",
13368,0,," united states officials say `` we have long said this conflict wo n't be won on the battlefield '' with the deputy national security advisor , ben rhodes , adding `` the united states will be supporting a process that is fundamentally afghan-led '' meaning that nato is no longer key to the process .
",
13369,0,," nato handing over control to the afghans and eventually withdrawing entirely will make peace more likely to succeed as the taliban `` considerers it its religious and national duty to gain independence from the occupation '' with this goal it wants `` to support a political and peaceful solution '' .
",
13370,0,," lasting peace is then only possible when nato leaves .
",
13371,0,," some of the biggest benefits of the nato occupation have been through the increase in democracy and human rights .
",
13372,0,," while these were not specific aims of the nato mission they were among the goals set out by the united nations .
",
13373,0,," there have been two presidential elections , one inthe other in, and two parliamentary elections ,andnone have been perfect but it is a clear advance from no elections at all .
",
13374,0,," the most notable human rights increase has been in women 's rights .
",
13375,0,," under the taliban afghanistan strictly limited the activities of women but today 27.3 % of the representatives in the parliament are women , better than in the uk or us , and the first female governor is in office .
",
13376,0,," the literacy rate is still low but they now make up 36.6 % of those in primary school up from almost nothing .
",
13377,0,," there have been similar gains in other human rights such as a reduction in the use of corporal punishments such as amputating hands for theft .
",
13378,0,," the ` rehabilitation ' of afghanistan 's infrastructure has not been an immense success due to the continuing bombing campaign which inevitably damages infrastructure but there have been big economic benefits from the nato presence .
",
13379,0,," there have been more than 4,000 schools built and 175,000 teachers trained , although more is needed this is an immense boost to education in afghanistan .
",
13380,0,," another benefit of increased stability is a renewal of outside investment , from china in particular .
",
13381,0,," china has been investing billions , several mining firms have made a $ 4.4 billion investment in one project ; an immense undeveloped copper reserve in aynak .
",
13382,0,," in total there is more than $billion being invested in infrastructure by afghanistan 's asian neighbours , as these investments are looking for profit they are clearly believed to be sustainable , by comparison the united states has only funded $ 1.6 billion since.
",
13383,1,,"turkey is a democracy, or at least it is usually considered as such.
",
13384,1,," it is the only middle eastern, and only country with a muslim majority, in nato, and it is a long term applicant to the european union.
",
13385,1,," however its slow progress in that regard is perhaps an indication that its democracy is not quite as entrenched as many would like.
",
13386,1,," turkey is a democratic, secular, and constitutional republic, but there are republicans who believe that all of these are threatened by the prime minister recep tayyip erdoğan and his justice and development party (akp) which have been in power for a decade.
",
13387,1,," until now however concern has not turned into outright protest, and while other areas of the middle east underwent revolutionary convulsions turkey has remained high and dry often being seen, not least by turkey’s leaders, as a model for the new emerging democracies in other parts of the middle east.
",
13388,1,,"on the 28th maya small group of activists attempted to stop the clearance of trees for the redevelopment of a park in istanbul.
",
13389,1,," the police response was heavy handed using tear gas resulting in growing protests around the park.
",
13390,1,," attempts a few days later to evict these protestors resulted in injuries to several people; again the result is a surge in the protests rather than the unrest dying down.
",
13391,1,," over the weekend the protests became much larger in scale centered on taksim square from which after a battle with demonstrators the police retreated.
",
13392,1,," the protests spread across much of the country and according to the turkish doctors’ association the clashes with police have left 1,000 people injured in istanbul andin ankara.
",
13393,1,,"although the protests were sparked by development of a green space the driving force behind the protest is democracy and fears about the authoritarianism of the ruling party.
",
13394,1,," protesters argue “he's [erdoğan] a dictator.
",
13395,1,," whenever we want to say our beliefs he always says: 'no you can't speak.
",
13396,1,," you are lying and you are very little.'”
",
13397,1,," they link the destruction of the park with taking away public spaces and observers contend that ""erdogan does not listen to anyone any more, not even to members of his own party.”
",
13398,1,," they believe the protests will force the prime minister to listen, others however say they won’t go away until he resigns.
",
13399,1,,"erdoğan’s response has perhaps been predictable, heaping blame on the opposition and social media; “there is now a menace which is called twitter… the best examples of lies can be found there.
",
13400,1,," to me, social media is the worst menace to society.”
",
13401,1,," a clear parallel to the ‘arab spring’ in tunisia which some called a ‘twitter revolution’.
",
13402,1,," however of course there are immense differences; even if it has its faults turkey is a democracy.
",
13403,1,," erdoğan has won three terms as prime minister which shows his popularity.
",
13404,1,," moreover the akp stays in power not because of the army – which is generally linked to the idea of a secular turkish state that erdoğan has undermined – as was the case in egypt but because of his popular support.
",
13405,1,," attempts to get him to stand down as a result of protests, demonstrations, and violence might very well be considered to be anti-democratic.
",
13406,1,,"there is then a question about whether turkey is a democracy and perhaps about democracy itself.
",
13407,1,," democracy can clearly be many different things.
",
13408,1,," at its most basic it is rule by the majority of the people but we usually consider it to be broader.
",
13409,1,," instead of just rule by the majority we consider democracy to be ‘liberal democracy’ which claus offe considers to have four basic elements; statehood – it must be within a defined territory with a functioning government in this case an effective and legitimate government, rule of law which limits the exercise of state power and provides personal rights to the people, political competition between contending parties that contest elections, and the rulers must be accountable not just through elections but also the media and other methods of removing the elite.
",
13410,1,,"  as the first definition is easily met even by a mob we will look at the second.
",
13411,0,," the rule of law , limits on the power of the state , and the provision of personal rights are key to any country being considered to be a liberal democracy but these are being undermined in turkey .
",
13412,0,," this is most noticeable when it comes to freedom of the press .
",
13413,0,," turkey 's press freedoms have been in decline .
",
13414,0,," it is a dismal 154th on the press freedom index and most notable is that it is the country with the most imprisoned journalists with at leastimprisoned , mostly without having been convicted and as a result of their work .
",
13415,0,," the lack of freedom of the press and how cowed the press is has been shown in the recent rioting ; cnn covered the protests live , at the same time its turkish language subsidiary cnn turk was broadcasting a cooking show .
",
13416,0,," turkey has been heading towards being a one party , even a one person , state .
",
13417,0,," erdoğan is intending to change the constitution is an attempt to institutionalise this .
",
13418,0,," his new presidency would have the power to issue decrees with force of law , dissolve parliament and call elections , and to command the military .
",
13419,0,," the attempt to change to a presidential system is clearly a move to enable erdoğan to avoid the limit of three terms in much the same way as vladimir putin did by switching jobs .
",
13420,0,," a presidential system is not bad in principle but it should not be simply used as a vehicle for a particular politician .
",
13421,0,," moreover any change of such a magnitude in a democratic country should be done only with popular consent -- something that this change does not have .
",
13422,0,," in a februarypoll 65.8 % of turks favoured keeping the parliamentary system and only 21.2 % were in favour of a change to a presidential system .
",
13423,0,," under the akp turkey has effectively become a one party state ; this means that there is not the competition necessary to make turkey a genuine liberal democracy .
",
13424,0,," yes alternative parties exist but this does not mean they are going to get any power any time soon if the government can help it .
",
13425,0,," the akp has been able to get twice as many votes as its nearest rival making it by far the dominant party .
",
13426,0,," the party consolidates power and there are signs that competition in the party is more important than with other parties .
",
13427,0,," the rioting across the country has shown this in several ways .
",
13428,0,," first the resort to violent and street protest shows the opposition do n't think they can oust the akp at the ballot box .
",
13429,0,," secondly the response from the leaders of the akp have been mixed .
",
13430,0,," while erdoğan has vehemently condemned the protests while president abdullah gül has taken a more nuanced line saying `` democracy is not just about elections '' and that `` if there are objections , there is nothing more natural than voicing them '' effectively endorsing some protest .
",
13431,0,," the trigger for the rioting ; construction projects building over a park and a square are a good analogy for the government as a whole .
",
13432,0,," the akp government does not care for public opinion and is happy to push through projects without reference to it .
",
13433,0,," in the case of taksim square the government did not consult about plans to bulldoze the park despite it being the site of a massacre inmaking it a place of historical significance .
",
13434,0,," a court ruling to stop construction was also ignored .
",
13435,0,," it is the same with legislation , the controversial changes to alcohol laws were only proposed a month before they were passed and debate was limited to two days , while some important business particularly involving day to day running of foreign and defence has very little oversight .
",
13436,0,," the akp is not just making turkey authoritarian it is making it an islamic authoritarian state .
",
13437,0,," since aamendment to the constitution turkey has been a secular state .
",
13438,0,," recently turkey rushed through restrictions on the sale of alcohol prohibiting sale overnight .
",
13439,0,," more worryingly than minor restrictions is a decline in gender equality and respect for religious minorities ; in, the year the akp came to power turkey was ranked 63rd in the un 's gender empowerment measure , byit had dropped to 101st out ofcountries .
",
13440,0,," without respect for these groups it is difficult to see how turkey can be considered a liberal democracy that provides for equal and personal rights .
",
13441,1,,"should women be allowed to serve in combat roles in the armed forces?
",
13442,1,," combat roles are usually defined as “roles whose primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy”.
",
13443,1,,"  examples are infantryman, tank crew member and combat pilot.
",
13444,1,,"the military roles open to women vary around the world.
",
13445,1,," legislative changes in the past few decades have allowed women to serve in all military roles in many western countries (such as canada, new zealand, sweden, norway, ireland, denmark, germany, finland and the netherlands).
",
13446,1,," most other western countries allow women to serve in a variety of roles but not in combat.
",
13447,1,," examples are the u.s. (united states) and u.k. (united kingdom).
",
13448,1,," nevertheless, the roles of women in the british and american militaries have been gradually increased.
",
13449,1,," the rand corporation studied increased deployment of women in all three branches of the united states military throughout the 1990s.
",
13450,1,," they wholeheartedly endorsed further integration, having found no great ill effects from expanding the roles of women in the different services over that period.
",
13451,1,," in 2002, the british ministry of defense reviewed whether to open combat roles to women and decided against it, while the service of american women in iraq and afghanistan wars has led to a renewed debate about opening combat roles to women in the u.s. military.
",
13452,1,,"during the twentieth century, equal opportunity laws have made it possible for women to work in many fields which were once exclusively male.
",
13453,1,," in many western countries, the military is now one of the very few parts of society to formally discriminate against women.
",
13454,1,," meanwhile, the number and nature of conflicts in the world have changed over the past century.
",
13455,1,,"since the end of the cold war, wars have become “less frequent and less deadly”.
",
13456,1,," in the past, wars were often fought between large armies with heavy weaponry, but many modern conflicts are l.i.c.s (low intensity conflicts), involving terrorist groups with guerilla tactics.
",
13457,1,," l.i.c. has been defined by the u.s. military as “... a political-military confrontation between contending states or groups below conventional war and above the routine, peaceful competition among states.
",
13458,1,," it frequently involves protracted struggles of competing principles and ideologies... it is waged by a combination of means, employing political, economic, informational, and military instruments.”
",
13459,1,," modern war has gained an intensity and geopolitical significance.
",
13460,1,," terrorists’ threats prompt the invasion of countries, while struggles for democracy often attract allied intervention.
",
13461,1,," an example is the n.a.t.o. (north atlantic treaty organization) involvement in the libyan civil war of 2011.
",
13462,1,,"interventions by western allied groups have increased, while young people in these countries are used to educational and economic opportunities that have largely removed their incentives to enlist.
",
13463,1,," since the cold war, most of these countries have ended conscription (with exceptions such as israel and russia), relying instead on a.v.f.s (all volunteer forces).
",
13464,1,," both these developments place pressure on recruitment.
",
13465,0,," militaries can use ` gender-blind ' recruitment and training processes , treating all candidates the same regardless of gender .
",
13466,0,," this is% fair and some women will certainly succeed in entering combatant roles and will prove themselves the equal or better than the men .
",
13467,0,," for example , several soviet women have distinguished themselves as snipers and combat aviators .
",
13468,0,," alternatively , militaries can calibrate recruitment and training to suit female candidates .
",
13469,0,," there is a precedent for this in the u.s. military 's a.p.f.t. , army physical fitness test , which has variations for age .
",
13470,0,," if the test standards can be lowered for older men , they can also be lowered for women .
",
13471,0,," in the modern high technology battlefield , technical expertise and decision-making skills are often more valuable than physical strength .
",
13472,0,," for example , in the american army , performance targets are regularly calibrated for age and position .
",
13473,0,," a forty year-old senior n.c.o. , non-commissioned officer , faces a much easier set of targets than hisyear-old subordinate , yet both are deployed in an active combat role .
",
13474,0,," modern warfare involves many l.i.c.s , where the battleground is as much `` hearts and minds '' as it is physical combat .
",
13475,0,," in a conflict where hearts and minds are important delicate handling of local people is required in order gain their support .
",
13476,0,," in l.i.c.s , women are often better suited to intelligence gathering , medical assistance , policing and mediation than men .
",
13477,0,," they are often perceived as less threatening and more understanding .
",
13478,0,," in addition , they would be better placed to deal with women in the local population .
",
13479,0,," for example , the job of many of the female u.s. marines killed and injured in junein iraq was to search women for explosives at checkpoints to avoid the near-universal sense of humiliation engendered by a member of the opposite sex conducting an intimate bodily search .
",
13480,0,," volunteer military forces face low recruitment and retention rates as a result of it being a tough and stressful job where workers can not work for as long as they do in many civilian jobs .
",
13481,0,," injuries and trauma caused by fighting also add to the turnover rate of soldiers .
",
13482,0,," as a result it is necessary to widen the applicant pool in order to be able to ensure there are more candidates for the army .
",
13483,0,," allowing women to serve in combat effectively doubles the possible talent pool available for the military to recruit for delicate and sensitive jobs which require interpersonal skills that not every soldier possesses .
",
13484,0,," the result will be better and more diplomatic soldiers who will be particularly useful in l.i.c.s. many modern conflicts are l.i.c.s which involve terrorist groups using guerilla tactics .
",
13485,0,," in these situations , there are no clear ` front-lines ' , and no clear difference between combatant and non-combatant roles .
",
13486,0,," all women serving in the military are exposed to `` front-line risks '' .
",
13487,0,," attacks on soldiers are as likely to occur on the military 's bases themselves as they are when the soldiers are out on patrol .
",
13488,0,," for example , in late june ofin iraq , two women marines were killed and about a dozen injured in a pair of suicide attacks .
",
13489,0,," that frontline combat operations are not always much more dangerous than other roles can be shown by the casualties in iraq comparing the initial invasion and reconstruction phases .
",
13490,0,," the united states lost very few casualties in the invasion phase of the war up to president bush 's declaration of victory onmaywith onlydead , compared to an overall death toll of.
",
13491,0,," if men and women are already in practice facing the same risks and as women and men are equal , there should be equality when it comes to being considered being in frontline combat service .
",
13492,0,," there is a fundamental principle that men and women should be considered equal in all walks of life ; and as such should both have an equal role in the military , including being in combat .
",
13493,0,," not allowing combat roles for women has an unfortunate side effect of increasing inequality in terms of ranks .
",
13494,0,," combat duty is necessary or highly beneficial for promotion to senior officer positions in many armies .
",
13495,0,," if women can not serve in combat , very few will ever reach the highest ranks of the military ; this creates a glass ceiling that will be very hard to break without this change to allowing women to serve in combat .
",
13496,0,," women have to be given the same opportunities as men , in the army in order to have the same opportunities they have to be exposed to the same risks .
",
13497,1,,"women are vastly underrepresented in democratic legislatures across the world.
",
13498,1,," untilyears ago women had never been more than 5% of mps in uk parliament1.
",
13499,1,," even today women hold barely 20% of parliamentary positions1.
",
13500,1,," governments and all the major political parties have been accused of merely 'window dressing' in their attitudes to female participation in politics.
",
13501,1,," a survey by the centre for women and democracy survey in mayshows that the green party is the most progressive party in encouraging women, with 33% of its candidates being female.
",
13502,1,," labour comes second with 30%, closely followed by the scottish national party with 29% and the conservatives trail with 24%.
",
13503,1,," perhaps surprisingly, the liberal democrats have the lowest proportion of women candidates of any of the larger parties at 21%2.
",
13504,1,,"internationally the uk currently ranks 47th in the world in terms of women's representation in national parliaments, behind rwanda, afghanistan and iraq; this is also behind the welsh assembly, where 50% of members are women, and the scottish parliament where the figure is 40%3.
",
13505,1,," out of theeu member states the uk currently ranks 15th1.
",
13506,1,," in addition, just 33% of the uk's meps are women, below the 36% average for meps from the othereu members states1.
",
13507,1,,"inlabour was elected with a record number of female mps through the use of all-female candidate lists.
",
13508,1,," many people argue for a similar form of 'affirmative action' or 'positive discrimination' to boost female candidacy and attempt to ensure parliaments will reflect the gender balance of their electorate.
",
13509,1,," this may be done either via targets (aiming to get a certain percentage of female candidates) or by quotas (requiring a certain number of women politicians), which are legally enforceable but inflexible.
",
13510,1,," other alternatives are all women shortlists from which parties select their candidate for constituencies.
",
13511,1,," an innovative proposal in nunavat, canada, suggested two-member constituencies (one male representative, one female), but this was defeated in a referendum in 19974.
",
13512,1,,"david cameron has said that his party will impose all-women shortlists; he said he 'desperately' wanted to address the 'failure' of parliament and the conservative party to reflect society5.
",
13513,1,," the underlying prejudice against women in parliament and government is undisputed; what is in dispute is the best way to address it.
",
13514,0,," essentially, what the proposition is arguing for is equality of outcome; the opposition counters with equality of opportunity.
",
13515,0,,"at present there is a vicious circle whereby women see no point in standing for politics because it is viewed as a male-dominated institution .
",
13516,0,," positive discrimination is the only way to encourage women to stand .
",
13517,0,," only if one generation is pushed towards politics can there be role models for potential future women mps to follow ; for that reason it need not be a permanent measure , just one that gets the ball rolling1 .
",
13518,0,," it has been proven by a study at the university of toronto , canada , that women need inspirational female role models more than men ; they need it to be demonstrated that it is possible to overcome barrier2 .
",
13519,0,," positive discrimination would provide this evidence and support .
",
13520,0,," this measure would simply allow women to overcome the institutional sexism in the selection committees of the established political parties , which has for so long prevented a representative number of women from becoming candidates , and would encourage other women to try and emulate that .
",
13521,0,," it 's about changing stereotypes and perception , particularly of the concept ` leadership ' , which we automatically think of as a male trait1 .
",
13522,0,," this will help achieve true progress in the future .
",
13523,0,," whilst is it possible for men to speak on women 's issues , some topics of debate , e.g. on family issues or equality in the workplace , are still seen as less important than economics or foreign policy .
",
13524,0,," creating more female mps would encourage more debates about social policy , and so do more to produce constructive legislation of relevance to real people 's lives .
",
13525,0,," for example , harriet harman is the first mp to seriously confront the gaps in the treatment of women and other minorities in the workplace1 .
",
13526,0,," this was previously seen as a ` soft ' issue unworthy of parliamentary attention ; she was more in touch with women 's , and , of course , many men 's , priorities and acted upon them .
",
13527,0,," if we want our political system to be in touch with the priorities of everyone , we must to act to increase women 's representation .
",
13528,0,," in a ` representative ' democracy it is vital that every part of the population be accurately and proportionately represented .
",
13529,0,," the present lack of female voices in parliaments across the world symbolises the continuing patriarchal societal bias .
",
13530,0,," women are over half of the population , yet less than% of the house of commons is made up of women .
",
13531,0,," as of, there are onlywomen , constituting 16.6 % of all representatives , serving in the house of representatives in the us .
",
13532,0,," in order to truly have a representative government , numbers must be increased to fairly mirror numbers in society .
",
13533,0,," all women shortlists and other artificial means are a quick and effective way of doing this .
",
13534,0,," even david cameron , a traditional opponent to positive discrimination for women , when asked whether a meritocracy was more desirable , said `` it does n't work '' ; `` we tried that for years and the rate of change was too slow .
",
13535,0,," if you just open the door and say ` you 're welcome , come in , ' and all they see is a wave of white , male , faces , it 's not very welcoming ``.
",
13536,0,," indeed , a recent report by the hansard society2 said that the numbers of women in uk parliament could fall unless positive action is taken3 .
",
13537,0,," sarah childs , launching the report , said that `` unless all parties use equality guarantees , such as all-women shortlists , it is most unlikely that they will select women in vacant seats ''.
",
13538,0,," compulsion is necessary to begin to achieve parity of representation4 .
",
13539,0,," the labour party used all-women shortlists in the's and many well-known female mps were elected this way .
",
13540,0,," positive action is vital for reasons of justice and fairness .
",
13541,1,,"campaign finance has always been a point of contention in american politics and the subject of a great deal of media attention every election cycle, because american political campaigns are particularly long and incredibly expensive.
",
13542,1,,"  money is needed to pay staff, buy media advertisement, and even raise more money.
",
13543,1,," presidential campaigns often cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
",
13544,1,," senate and congressional campaigns can cost several million dollars.
",
13545,1,," in parliamentary democracies with smaller districts and shorter election cycles (or more irregular election cycles), the costs could be different and less significant.
",
13546,1,,"campaign finance reform (cfr) began in earnest in the post-watergate era in the united states with the passage of the federal election campaign act which created the federal election commission (fec), implemented disclosure requirements, donation limits, and federal financing of presidential elections.
",
13547,1,," the landmark supreme court decision of buckley v. valeo (1976) struck down the controversial provision of spending limits, as well as a provision of the law that limited the amount of personal money someone could spend on their own campaign.
",
13548,1,," eventually, this system of laws unraveled as the supreme court affirmed that political parties, labor unions, and political action committees(pacs) could spend unlimited amounts of “soft money” - spending not directly associated with a candidate’s campaign, such as broad issue advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and party building strategies.
",
13549,1,," pacs are types of organisations that campaign for or against candidates and are allowed to receive limited contributions from individuals but not from corporations and unions.
",
13550,1,,"however, ina landmark case came before the supreme court, citizens united v fec, which overturned a provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act that prohibited corporations and labor unions from airing issue advocacy advertisements during the weeks immediately preceding an election.
",
13551,1,,"  furthermore, it overturned a prior supreme court decision that prohibited corporations and unions from engaging in direct advocacy – that is, advertisements that directly encourage citizens to vote for or against a candidate.
",
13552,1,," along with other related court decision, this decision is connected to the formation of super pacs.
",
13553,1,,"  super pacs, in turn, are organizations that can receive unlimited individual, corporate, and labor union contributions to influence elections but may not co-ordinate with their chosen candidate’s campaign.
",
13554,1,,"  total super pacs spending onelections reached $567,498,628 which invokes doubts over the integrity, corruption, and accountability of candidates to their constituency in comparison to their contributors.
",
13555,1,," super pacs are required by law to disclose the names of their donors and the amounts that people have donated.
",
13556,1,," there have been other recent setbacks in bringing transparency to us politics, the disclose act for example was blocked by the republicans, but there has been legislation requiring on air identification of all advertisers.
",
13557,1,,"bearing these events in mind, this debate will be looking at a campaign finance reform on whether corporations and individuals should be permitted to make unlimited contributions; whether corporations deserve the same political and/or speech rights as individuals; and whether those who engage in issuing advertisements should disclose their donors in the advertisements.
",
13558,0,,"   currently , super pacs are organizations that can receive unlimited contributions , which encourages the belief that the amount of money contributed is directly correlated to the amount of influence the donor could have .
",
13559,0,," by permitting individuals or corporations to make unlimited contributions , the current legislation undermines the democratic character of the elective process .
",
13560,0,," political figures related to the sponsored super pacs have an incentive to satisfy the needs of those who contribute huge amounts of funding towards their campaign rather than meet the needs of the average citizen .
",
13561,0,," this is not the way that democracy should be ; it must represent the viewpoint and needs of the majority of the population , not just the small fraction of it that is wealthy enough to effectively pay for policies they want .
",
13562,0,," furthermore , caps on contributions to super pacs will bring competition in elections back into the mainstream and when more citizens contribute to politicians , they will be more engaged in politics .
",
13563,0,," for example , the pass of the bipartisan campaign reform act , bcra , eliminated soft money for parties and attempted to handle the elections contributions through pacs .
",
13564,0,," with the elimination of soft money for parties , the role of interest groups investment decreased in the 1990s .
",
13565,0,," obama 's campaign inraised 114.1 million or% of his general election fund from small contributions .
",
13566,0,," his unprecedented small donor fundraising success can be interpreted as increased credibility and public visibility for obama and through this the benefit of mobilizing lots of small donations .
",
13567,0,," in, obama used online communications and social networking tools to reach and mobilise more people .
",
13568,0,," in effect of this approach , he not only inspired an unprecedented number of young and retired people to get involved in the campaign , but also achieved the highest rate of small contributions .
",
13569,0,," when a corporation and an individual are both trying to achieve the same goal , they should be able to do so in the same way .
",
13570,0,," it would be unfair if the campaign finance reform limits the amount that an individual could contribute , but not that of a corporation when it is apparent that corporations are contributing considerably larger amounts than individuals as seen in the case of the pharmaceutical industry .
",
13571,0,," corporations need to have the same rights and limitations on campaign contributions and economic freedom .
",
13572,0,," this was why the us supreme court ruled that the federal ban on spending by corporations was unconstitutional under the first amendment act in.
",
13573,0,," this led to the super pacs because they represent an association of people and have the right to freedom of speech and political preference .
",
13574,0,," reforms , such as bipartisan campaign reform act , bcra , may have been successful in curtailing interest groups role as investors in campaigns , they failed when it comes to candidate advocacy as a result of super pacs .
",
13575,0,," such regulations that limit large-scale political spending from interest groups serves to limit speech crucial to political groups without a broad base of support or political entrepreneurs like swift boat veterans for truth that got its message aired when the national media was ignoring the issue .
",
13576,0,," moreover , bans on corporate contributions did not prevent alternative ways for candidate advocacy , such as the private satellite radio station of the national rifle association or the movies made by the citizens united these alternative ways could undermine the principle of fair and transparent campaigns more than the lack of such limit on spending from individuals and corporations and their political expression .
",
13577,0,," a further reform limiting super pacs would have the effect of leveling the playing field for candidates .
",
13578,0,," candidates with enormous leadership potential but small wallets have failed due to the lack of resources .
",
13579,0,," under a reformed campaign finance system , it will be more difficult for well-financed candidates to win purely because of the money they have .
",
13580,0,," incumbent candidates have a unique advantage over challengers in the present system because of their direct connections to important sources of money .
",
13581,0,," campaign finance reform will make elections more competitive and thus enhance higher turnover or `` fresh blood '' in politics .
",
13582,0,," this is essential for challenging old orthodoxies and bringing in new ideas .
",
13583,0,," it will also make it easier for members of ethnic minorities and the working class to seek office - such groups are disproportionately deterred from candidacy by the current need to raise large sums of money .
",
13584,0,," quantitative analysis of elections involving incumbents from twenty-five states across three election cycles indicate that more stringent campaign finance laws increase the likelihood of new challengers to the current incumbent .
",
13585,0,," financing laws limiting fundraising increase the likelihood of minority-party and independent challengers and produce higher rate of election competition .
",
13586,0,," as a result challengers feel they have better chances against the incumbents .
",
13587,0,," campaign finance reform gives the individual donor a voice more comparable to other donors ' interests .
",
13588,0,," at present , the enormous amount of money channeled into campaigns by large corporations , unions , and special interest groups through pacs overwhelm the smaller , limited contributions of individual donors .
",
13589,0,," reforming the super pacs and limiting these large group donations would increase the significance of donations by individual voters , likely increasing the responsiveness of candidates to voters/donors and so increasing their accountability to their electorate .
",
13590,0,," additionally , the increased significance of individual contributions encourages voter participation and activism .
",
13591,0,," allowing anonymity of contribution to `` issue ads '' and to super pacs only amplifies the corrosive effect money has on american politics .
",
13592,0,," without knowing where the funding for particular `` issue ads '' come from , the intentions of contributors can be obfuscated and issues can be easily branded into political palatable campaigns by allowing contributors to keep themselves and their agendas hidden .
",
13593,0,," using names such as the `` america future fund '' and the `` coalition of american seniors '' political allegiances and agendas are hidden from view , removing a much needed critical evaluation of those who contribute and what their ends are .
",
13594,0,," further to this , the anonymity of super pacs make it easy for foreign contributors , who are banned by us law from contributing to campaigns , to secretly contribute to campaigns , helping to skew american democracy by giving undue political influence to foreign corporations and their interests .
",
13595,0,," anonymity of super pacs allows people to obfuscate their intentions and turn campaigns into opaque propaganda , removing the capacity for proper democracy and political debate .
",
13596,1,,"this first of all makes the assumption that a strike against terrorists is going to be made.
",
13597,1,," the debate is therefore not focused on whether there should be military action to strike at terrorists but whether we should be using unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs), sometimes called drones, in order to strike at these targets.
",
13598,1,," uav’s have a wide variety of uses and capabilities ranging from reconnaissance to research and development but are best known for their use by the united states in attacking suspected terrorist targets.
",
13599,1,," the uavs used primarily for this purpose are the mq1 predators and the mq9 reapers.
",
13600,1,," the more advanced reaper has a payload of 3,000 pounds allowing it to carry up tohellfire missiles and it can stay airborne forhours giving its operators plenty of time to confirm the target and choose the ideal time to attack.
",
13601,1,,"  on 3rd novemberthe first uav attack outside a theatre of war took place to kill suspected al qaeda terrorists in yemen.
",
13602,1,," strikes by uavs in pakistan, where they have been most controversial, started on 17th junein an attack that killed a local taliban commander nek mohammed and up to four other alleged taliban however it also resulted in the deaths of two children.
",
13603,1,," since then there have been aboutstrikes by uavs in pakistan, yemen, and somalia.
",
13604,0,," there are only two things that really matter when targeting terrorists ; is the terrorist eliminated , and is collateral damage kept to a minimum ?
",
13605,0,," in pakistan there have been a total ofstrikes by uavs betweenand junewith the total reported killed at 2496-3202 of which only 482-832 were civilians according to the bureau of investigative journalism .
",
13606,0,," moreover the number of civilians killed in strikes is falling ;percent of casualties inwere civilians but bythis had fallen topercent and this is a figure that is likely to continue falling as drones improve technologically making identification easier and making strikes more precise .
",
13607,0,," these figures show that the united states in its use of drones is not only hitting a lot of terrorist targets and eliminating them but is causing very little collateral damage in comparison to the number of strikes made .
",
13608,0,," we need to eliminate terrorists somehow and uavs are the best possible equipment with which to carry out this mission .
",
13609,0,," all the other options either would result in significantly more casualties or would have other problems that would likely allow terrorists to escape .
",
13610,0,," first there is the collateral damage that would be caused by using other alternatives to striking terrorists .
",
13611,0,," professor plaw of the university of massachusetts says that when terrorists were being confronted by the pakistani army , who were attacking at the behest of the united states ,% of casualties were collateral damage .
",
13612,0,," a similar number of% was the figure when israel was targeting hamas .
",
13613,0,," when compared to theor% collateral damage figures for uavs the choice should be easy .
",
13614,0,," moreover other options have other disadvantages .
",
13615,0,," sending a hit squad in to eliminate terrorists may mean little collateral damage but would cause a diplomatic crisis as it would be tantamount to invading another country .
",
13616,0,," using a missile or local support on the other hand significantly increases the chances of the target escaping .
",
13617,0,," pakistan 's isi , military intelligence , has for example been accused of helping the taliban -- they could hardly be trusted to kill them .
",
13618,0,," when engaging in covert operations it is essential that the right target is identified so that the correct target is eliminated .
",
13619,0,," this is something that using uavs allows as they are able to track their target , sometimes for days , before attacking .
",
13620,0,," this means there is much more time for scrutiny of targets and possible collateral damage .
",
13621,0,," this also means that there is plenty of room for the decisions to be made right at the top .
",
13622,0,," every person on the kill list gets discussed at a weekly meeting of more thanmembers of the us government 's security apparatus .
",
13623,0,," president obama himself signs off on strikes and can change the decision if the situation on the ground changes .
",
13624,0,," former national security advisor jones says `` many times ... at the 11th hour we waved off a mission simply because the target had people around them and we were able to loiter on station until they did n't . ''
",
13625,0,," while uavs may be ` unmanned ' they are certainly heavily monitored as each drone hasmilitary personnel rotating in three shifts .
",
13626,0,," they include seven joystick pilots , seven system operators , and five mission coordinators , there is also from the ciapeople , includingvideo crew members , andintelligence analysts .
",
13627,0,," this means that there are a large number of eyeballs to make sure that the right person is being targeted , to check he is with as few others as possible before the strike .
",
13628,0,," none of this would be possible with other forms of attack where the emphasis has to be on the speed of the operation .
",
13629,0,," to put it bluntly any military or intelligence service wants to keep its own men safe while carrying out its missions ; unmanned aerial vehicles are the ultimate capability with which to manage this .
",
13630,0,," no military or civilian personnel are going to be killed if the delivery vehicle is controlled from the united states .
",
13631,0,," this means that unlike in other methods of attack the uav can take its time even if it is at risk .
",
13632,0,," in the war in kosovo nato air forces had to launch their attacks from 15,000 feet due to worries they would be shot down .
",
13633,0,," attacking from such a height from a fast moving aeroplane makes missing the target much more likely .
",
13634,1,,"inthe united kingdom became the third country to test and independently developed nuclear weapon.
",
13635,1,," the country continues to have nuclear weapons in its arsenal and is one of the five nuclear weapons states set out in the nuclear non proliferation treaty of 1968.
",
13636,1,," however despite having independently developed nuclear weapons the united kingdom now cooperates with the united states in developing its nuclear weapons.
",
13637,1,," britain’s current nuclear deterrent is maintained by four vanguard submarines with the first having been commissioned in 1993.
",
13638,1,," these submarines each carry sixteen trident missiles which were designed by the united states and are provided to the uk by a modification of the previous the polaris sales agreement.
",
13639,1,," the submarines are expected to remain in service until the 2020s.
",
13640,1,," inthe white paper ‘the future of the united kingdom’s nuclear deterrent’ argued that britain needs to retain a nuclear deterrent but did not take the final decision on the replacement of trident or if it is retained how much of a deterrent is needed.
",
13641,1,," but because of the long lead time necessary for designing and building replacements work has already started on some of the components which would be necessary for new submarines such as the reactor cores.
",
13642,1,," despite this the government maintains the final decision on trident has not yet been made and is expected in 2016.
",
13643,0,," the trident weapons system while it may be a `` horrific part of our system '' is still necessary even in today 's post-cold war world .
",
13644,0,," firstly through deterrence it protects us from being blackmailed by any other states , and in particular so called `` rogue states '' like north korea and potentially in the future iran who could threaten our vital interests -- such as closing the straits of hormuz .
",
13645,0,," moreover having a second strike capability , the ability for nuclear weapons to survive a nuclear assault by an opponent so allowing retaliation , is also still necessary .
",
13646,0,," it may currently seem unlikely that any of the major nuclear armed states will threaten the united kingdom however we do not know what may happen in the future and by the time a threat appears it would be too late to build a new nuclear second strike capability .
",
13647,0,," currently the uk is recognised as a nuclear power by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty along with the usa , china , france and russia .
",
13648,0,," all of whom are either modernising or maintaining their current nuclear arsenals .
",
13649,0,," this means to not replace trident would mean that we 'd suffer a severe loss of status in relation to the other permanent members of the un security council .
",
13650,0,," this would also raise questions of whether the uk even deserves its place as a member there as it would show the uk 's declining global role and military power .
",
13651,0,," other countries that can be considered `` more representative '' such as india , the world 's largest democracy , now would be an obvious replacement at the top table .
",
13652,0,," churchill said that the h bomb that it was `` our badge to the royal enclosure , at ascot , '' and today trident remains one of our master keys to the britain 's status at organisations such as the united nations security council .
",
13653,0,," there are already plenty of reasons why other countries might be more deserving of a security council place than the uk ; we do n't need to add another .
",
13654,0,," the uk nuclear weapons programme was first created in latea time when people were concerned about the us commitment to europe which was uncertain as the rise of the iron curtain had not been yet apparent .
",
13655,0,," currently if we did n't replace trident and disarmed more likely than not we would fall under the american strategic nuclear umbrella which would be fair enough in the short term and medium term as the relationship is currently strong despite certain cobblestones .
",
13656,0,," a similar thing also applies with the french but can we really rely on the americans to keep that umbrella extended over the long term when their interests and emphasis may shift , regardless of cultural or ideological links ?
",
13657,0,," relying on someone else 's deterrent will always be risky as the us or france would not want to put themselves at risk of being attacked in order to deter an attack on us .
",
13658,0,," an independent deterrence arsenal is necessary to maintain deterrence .
",
13659,1,,"an open primary is a primary election that does not require voters to be affiliated with a political party in order to vote for partisan candidates.
",
13660,1,," in a traditional open primary, voters may select one party's ballot and vote for that party's nomination without being a member of that party.
",
13661,1,," as in a closed primary, the highest voted candidate in each party then proceeds to the runoff election.
",
13662,1,," in a nonpartisan blanket primary, all candidates appear on the same ballot and the two highest voted candidates proceed to the runoff, regardless of party affiliation.
",
13663,1,," the constitutionality of this system was affirmed by the supreme court of the united states in 2008, whereas a partisan blanket primary was previously ruled to be unconstitutional in 2000.
",
13664,1,," in the united states, alabama, arizona, arkansas, california, georgia, hawaii, idaho, indiana, michigan, minnesota, mississippi, missouri, north dakota, south carolina, tennessee, texas, vermont, virginia, wisconsin.
",
13665,1,," california's decision to adopt an open primary system was particularly controversial in june ofthrough proposition 14th.
",
13666,1,," as the country's most populous state, its overwhelming voter approval of the proposition widened many eyes about the potential of open primaries across the country and around the world, enlivening the  topic to a new level.
",
13667,0,," a major problem with politics in western liberal democracies is that electorates feel disengaged from the political process as they are generally presented with a choice between parties at irregular intervals without much oversight over the calibre of candidate presented to them by each party .
",
13668,0,," this issue would be countered by introducing open primaries for candidates to elections .
",
13669,0,," by making candidates from the same party compete for a party candidacy by appealing to the same group that will choose between all parties in general elections , voters will have a chance to greater examine each prospective candidate at greater detail , allowing for a more considered choice of candidate than the binary choice made at elections .
",
13670,0,," by giving more time to voters , this will increase interest in what candidates have to say , and allow those of all political persuasions to contribute to the debate , turning contests away from ideology and towards representation .
",
13671,0,," by creating a situation whereby all voters have a potential say in selecting candidates , it can prevent overweening control by party grass roots who may vote for overtly ideological candidates who turn off the moderate voters needed to win elections .
",
13672,0,," an open primary is more likely to choose more centrist candidates for the general election , providing a degree of moderation to the process of election and politics in general .
",
13673,0,," this in turn can help foster a consensual atmosphere in political discourse with general agreed points , focusing the debate on more core issues between the main parties .
",
13674,0,," this then means that much more is likely to get done .
",
13675,0,," at the moment american politics is plagued by gridlock both in the states and in congress .
",
13676,0,," individuals elected under open primaries are much more likely to be willing to compromise across the aisle .
",
13677,0,," as a result government will begin moving again .
",
13678,0,," a major problem with general elections , specifically in countries such as the united states , united kingdom and canada which use majoritarian simple plurality electoral systems , is that only two major parties , e.g. democrats and republicans , are in contention for power or in some cases representation , leaving those that have loyalties elsewhere feeling disenfranchised from a political system that does not take into account of their point of view .
",
13679,0,," open primaries counters this by allowing these voters a chance to vote for candidates of a major party that are closer to their own political persuasion , thus giving as many people as possible the opportunity to register their opinion on who will be their representative for the next term , ending disillusionment with predictable election results .
",
13680,0,," this means that third party candidates may become serious candidates in elections when they pass the primary test .
",
13681,0,," political parties are able to wield considerable power , controlling their party members and representatives , particularly in parliamentary political systems .
",
13682,0,," through use of patronage and the threat of sanctions such as deselection , party leaders are able to manipulate representatives to fulfil their own aims rather than those of constituents .
",
13683,0,," by instituting open primaries , the focus of representatives shifts from the party leadership to the constituents whom prospective candidates hope to represent .
",
13684,0,," scrutiny over the representative 's conduct would be in the hands of the voters , with reselection in an open primary being contingent upon the member looking after the interests of their constituents , rather than the interest of the party as is the case in many countries that do not have open primary systems .
",
13685,0,," by using open primaries , elections once again becomes about representing the people as opposed to being a means to power as is the case under the status quo in countries that do not use it .
",
13686,0,," open primaries allows for the electorate to make a considered choice between candidate and party , with other considerations beyond the partisan being up for consideration .
",
13687,0,," in safe districts , voters are given a choice between members of the same party , allowing for voters to effectively choose the next member based upon past record and views on big issues , allowing for the ideological cleavages within parties to brought under closer examination , with voters in the safe seat choosing the type of conservatism/liberalism/socialism they prefer .
",
13688,0,," this can help to provide choice even when one party is already assured of winning the seat , thus providing a degree of competition in the district , engaging voters in the electoral process .
",
13689,1,,"it’s difficult to see the party uniting behind any of the candidates and it appears to be suffering from symptoms similar to their fellow conservatives in their crushing defeat at the hands of tony blair in 1997.
",
13690,1,," with the tea party movement demanding ideological purity from candidates but with little evidence that candidates would be likely to garner widespread support in the electorate as a whole.
",
13691,1,,"by contrast the socially conservative and evangelical christian components of the party have not only become the leading voice in the party but have consistently spoken to and delivered states, such as kansas, which demographically should be blue.
",
13692,1,," with such clout it seems only sensible that candidates should focus on their concerns and speak on their behalf.
",
13693,1,," all candidates, in both parties, address their base during the primaries before returning to a broader, more consensual approach.
",
13694,1,," many supporters of the party believe that the socially conservative approach  - opposing the liberal consensus of much of the media – is not only morally correct but makes good political sense in a nation with genuine social difficulties and all too few solutions to them.
",
13695,0,," it 's difficult for a predominantly working class party to get all that excited about the choice between a range of millionaires .
",
13696,0,," the bush presidency made it all too clear that the interests of the rich are the primary interest of the party and that it fails to deliver on areas such as a commitment to smaller government .
",
13697,0,," as party activists becomes ever more obsessed with issues such as gay marriage or the flag-burning amendment , it simply fails to address the concerns of most americans to whom it has little to say .
",
13698,0,," until it has a clearer and reasonable economic message , there is little it has to say and less worth listening to .
",
13699,0,," both the labour and conservative parties in the uk , the conservatives in canada , the socialists in france and many others all over the world have gone through periods of regrouping following extended periods in office .
",
13700,0,," the tea party movement has hijacked the republican party , bullying elected representatives to pursue a very narrow political agenda that has more to do with their moral outlook than the traditional role of politics .
",
13701,0,," the tea party has little in the way of a political programme and nothing in the way of understanding the nuances of local politics or the realities of electoral politics .
",
13702,0,," while the party remains in thrall to this vociferous but unrepresentative minority , it has little to offer the wider party and les to offer the wider american public .
",
13703,0,," although they are strident in terms of what they are against , they have little to offer by way of a substantive contribution to the national debate .
",
13704,1,,"nato is an alliance ofstates from europe and north america.
",
13705,1,," it was founded inat the start of the cold war to provide for the collective defense of its members, and for much of its history was focused on the military threat posed by the forces of the soviet union and the warsaw pact.
",
13706,1,," since the end of the cold war in 1989, the direct military threat to nato’s european member states has substantially diminished and nato has transformed itself to additionally include crisis management beyond its borders and collective security amongst its tasks.
",
13707,1,," this requires substantial investment by its member states to modernize their armed forces to be deployable and sustainable overseas.
",
13708,1,," more recently, the long term effects of the global financial crisis have underlined the strain that defense expenditure puts on the governments of the member states.
",
13709,1,," and, under the terms of nato’s treaty, its european member states should still be able to expect military assistance from the united states and canada in the event of an attack.
",
13710,1,,"  should nato’s european members reduce their armed forces?
",
13711,0,," the threat of a direct military attack on the european member states is very remote .
",
13712,0,," as nato 's new strategic concept acknowledges : `` today , the euro-atlantic area is at peace and the threat of a conventional attack against nato territory is low . ''
",
13713,0,," nato troops are involved only in crises abroad , such as the war in afghanistan and nato 's intervention in libya .
",
13714,0,," these operations do not affect the security of the member states -- they have no need to maintain expensive armed forces to fight such ` wars of choice ' or to help others when there are problems at home .
",
13715,0,," further , the money that the member states spend participating in such operations could be better spent on things that would really help in these regions -- such as development aid .
",
13716,0,," the commitment to collective defense remains a core purpose of the alliance .
",
13717,0,," articleof the nato treaty specifically states : `` the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . ''
",
13718,0,," the treaty goes on to state that nato states will use the full force necessary to defend against such an attack .
",
13719,0,," this commitment was recently reaffirmed in nato 's new strategic concept : `` nato members will always assist each other against attack , in accordance with articleof the washington treaty .
",
13720,0,," that commitment remains firm and binding . ''
",
13721,0,," furthermore , nato has already backed up its words with actions : when articlewas invoked on september following the attacks on new york and washington , nato agreed on , and delivered , a package of measures to support the united states .
",
13722,0,," and the united states , which has the largest armed forces among the allies is also firm in its commitment to defending other nato allies .
",
13723,0,," for example , rose gottemoeller , u.s. assistant secretary of state for verification , stated on a visit to lithuania : `` the point that i can most clearly repeat and underscore today for you is that nato will protect nato ... i know that is a view that is shared by all nato allies that nato will protect nato '' .
",
13724,0,," so , it seems clear that nato would defend its european member states if they were attacked , allowing them an opportunity to reduce their armed forces .
",
13725,0,," if nato needed to step in to defend europe , it would be able to call on substantial armed forces .
",
13726,0,," according to gareth evans , chancellor of the australian national university , nato has `` a formidable war-fighting and peace enforcement capacity , in terms not only of the raw numbers of both personnel , some 2.5 million in uniform , and equipment , over 5,000 helicopters for a start , but also their interoperability , highly professional and integrated military command structure . ''
",
13727,0,," indeed , nato has shown itself to be effective in the past .
",
13728,0,," evans again argues , `` nato has demonstrated in more recent years considerable competence in the actual conduct of military operations , '' citing the operations in kosovo in, bosnia fromto, and afghanistan since.
",
13729,0,," given this substantial capability , there can be little justification for continued high levels of defense spending in europe .
",
13730,0,," given that nato members will defend one another , and that `` three nato members -- the united states , britain and france - between them deploy more than 10,000 nuclear weapons , '' conventional wars are extremely unlikely .
",
13731,0,," as professor kenneth waltz argues , `` wars can be fought in the face of deterrent threats , but the higher the stakes and the closer a country moves toward winning them , the more surely that country invites retaliation and risks its own destruction .
",
13732,0,," states are not likely to run major risks for minor gains . ''
",
13733,0,," no likely aggressor is likely to be able to make such gains against europe as to make the risk of nuclear war worth the risk .
",
13734,0,," given that most nato members have been in a deep recession , and direct military threats to their territories are unlikely , it only makes sense to cut defense expenditure .
",
13735,0,," in the uk , for example , gaby hinsliff noted , `` as a result of the costs of borrowing through a recession , in five years ' time the national debt is forecast to reach # 1.3 trillion '' -- clearly , nato members have more pressing concerns than keeping up superfluous armies .
",
13736,0,," currently , britain spends over% of its gdp on defense , and secretary of state for defence liam fox recently admitted that the mission in libya may cost the uk up to #million .
",
13737,0,," with a growing military cost for ammunition , wages and supplies , such as food , nato members can afford no course of action other than cutting their armed forces costs .
",
13738,1,,"most democratic constitutions make some provision for the use of referendums – a public vote which asks the electorate its opinion on a specific proposal to change the law or constitution – to consult citizens on matters considered to be of special importance.
",
13739,1,," however, with a few exceptions, most nations use this power extremely infrequently.
",
13740,1,,"supporters of referendums believe that they are a thoroughly good idea; they return power to the hands of the people, increase engagement with politics, and ensure that everyone’s views are represented in the political debate.
",
13741,0,," but opponents argue that increased use of referendums would not improve decision-making; on the contrary, they say, putting too many questions before the public in referendums leads to short-term policymaking, turns complex, nuanced debates into simplistic campaigns between slogan-wielding factions, and would just irritate voters who are already fed up of politics.
",
13742,0,,"governments exist to serve the will of the people , not the other way round ; politicians take their instructions from their constituents , or should do .
",
13743,0,," but in the modern state this relationship is often inverted .
",
13744,0,," by obliging our democratic institutions to take genuine account of public opinion , and returning real political power back to those to whom it rightly belongs -- the people -- we can put the relationship between the individual and the state back on a healthier footing .
",
13745,0,," in principle , people should have the right to decide for themselves on matters of importance to their lives .
",
13746,0,," in the past , it was impractical to organise frequent referendums due to the difficulty and expense of holding them .
",
13747,0,," but with the advent of the internet and mass media , it is now easier than ever to consult the public on issues of concern to them .
",
13748,0,," for example , switzerland regularly holds referendums on all sorts of issues in an efficient manner which commands widespread public support .
",
13749,0,," people are apathetic about politics because they only get to vote once every few years .
",
13750,0,," even then it is not directly for policies but for competing political parties who promise to implement them , but often reverse position when in office .
",
13751,0,," they feel that politicians do not listen to them between elections , and disengagement with the political process grows and grows .
",
13752,0,," more frequent referendums would stimulate interest in politics because people would actually get a say in decisions .
",
13753,0,," for example , evidence from the us shows that states with frequent use of ballot initiatives tend to have higher voter participation in elections .
",
13754,0,," many countries have two or three party systems in which there is no spread of opinion between these parties .
",
13755,0,," the parties reflect sterile mainstream consensus and do not offer voters what they really want .
",
13756,0,," consequently , large sectors of the public find their views unrepresented .
",
13757,0,," referendums will remedy this and increase engagement with the political system , because people will know that their views simply can not be ignored .
",
13758,0,," for example , a majority in the uk favour the return of the death penalty , but no party among the main three offers this .
",
13759,0,," whatever your views on this issues , it seems unfair that there is simply no way for voters ' views to be represented .
",
13760,0,," the trend in developed countries tends to be towards greater centralisation , and concentration of power in the hands of a small number of representatives .
",
13761,0,," this , in turn , leads to the creation of a separate political class who will in some cases be more concerned with their own influence and enrichment than that of the voters , and makes it possible for wealthy individuals or companies to lobby politicians for laws favourable to their interests .
",
13762,0,," increased use of referendums would potentially reduce the influence of lobby groups and corporate donors on the political system .
",
13763,0,," particularly on contentious or controversial issues .
",
13764,0,," laws passed by public approval in this way will be less open to challenge , with all sides having to accept the will of the electorate .
",
13765,0,," this is especially true of minority or coalition governments who may face accusations that they do not have a mandate for certain policies , or situations where minority groups are exercising their right to self-determination .
",
13766,1,,"for its size and wealth north korea gets a lot of international attention.
",
13767,1,," it regularly gets into the media around the world and is the subject of numerous high powered rounds of talks and discussions in the security council.
",
13768,1,," yet despite all the attention north korea gets from the press, diplomats, and policymakers north korea also regularly seems to get its own way in negotiations and its on-going brinkmanship with the rest of the world despite the obvious disparities between the north korean state and even its southern adversary let along the united states.
",
13769,1,,"north korea, formally the democratic people’s republic of korea, occupies the northern half of the korean peninsula which was divided at the 38th parallel at the end of the second world war with the northern half administered by the soviet union while the south was administered by the united states.
",
13770,1,," the soviet union handed over control to the democratic people’s republic in 1948.
",
13771,1,," war between the two koreas in the early 1950s did not resolve the split and today korea is one of the few areas where the cold war continues.
",
13772,1,,"north korea is small, at 120,000km2 slightly smaller than the us state of mississippi, is mostly mountainous, has a relatively small population of 24.5 million people who are extremely poor with gdp per capita at purchasing power parity of $1,800.
",
13773,1,," the attention this country gets is therefore completely out of proportion with the importance that would normally be given a country of similar size and wealth, for example cambodia.
",
13774,1,," north korea’s influence comes from several factors;should the great powers in the region simply ignore the regime and continue business as usual when these intermittent provocations occur?
",
13775,0,," the two koreas should be able to solve the situation themselves without recourse to all the neighbouring powers -- whose interest does not seem to have spurred a solution to the frozen conflict anyway .
",
13776,0,," with the cold war over south korea is more than capable of handling its own security .
",
13777,0,," south korea is economically far ahead of the north with its economy thirty seven times bigger .
",
13778,0,," its military is also more capable than the north 's as the international institute for strategic studies argues `` as measured by static equipment indices , south korea 's conventional forces would appear superior to north korea 's .
",
13779,0,," when morale , training , equipment maintenance , logistics , and reconnaissance and communications capabilities are factored in , this qualitative advantage increases . ''
",
13780,0,," so should be able to deter aggression on its own and pull its own weight in negotiations without the need of a multilateral process .
",
13781,0,," moreover no one would argue that an invasion should be ignored however the south should be the one who responds to north korean actions on its own .
",
13782,0,," north korea has an attention seeking cycle on the go that was used by kim jong il and now seems to be used by his son kim jong un .
",
13783,0,," essentially north korea takes a provocative action , as big or small as it thinks necessary -- this may be a missile launch , right up to some kind of military attack , in order to grab the world 's attention .
",
13784,0,," there is then a period where there are condemnations and threats to increase sanctions that usually do n't get anywhere as they are blocked by china .
",
13785,0,," the north korean regime will then proclaim a willingness to do business and negotiate giving minor concessions on the issue of the provocation in return for aid or whatever the regime happens to want at the time .
",
13786,0,," of course whatever concession it gives is easily reversible so setting up another round .
",
13787,0,," this is a good deal for north korea as it essentially gets aid in return for bad behaviour , it is therefore not surprising that the north is willing to continue engaging in bad behaviour .
",
13788,0,," the responses to north korean provocations do not bring a solution any closer .
",
13789,0,," north korea has yet to sign a peace treaty with the south and the united states .
",
13790,0,," it is however particularly interested in signing a treaty with the united states rather than the south .
",
13791,0,," inthe north korean foreign ministry proposed that `` if confidence is to be built between , north korea , and the us , it is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war , a root cause of the hostile relations , to begin with '' .
",
13792,0,," the north wants a peace treaty with the us so as to drive a wedge between the usa and south korea to prevent us support for the south in the event of war .
",
13793,0,," ignoring such efforts at negotiating with the usa without south korea in the room , and indeed all advances and provocations would force the north to accept that it has to negotiate with the south or with no one .
",
13794,0,," ignoring north korean actions and reducing the number of allies negotiating while maintaining security guarantees prevents any chance of the north dividing the usa and south korea .
",
13795,1,,"puerto rico, officially the commonwealth of puerto rico, is a self-governing unincorporated territory of the united states located in the north-eastern caribbean.
",
13796,1,," the united states conquered puerto rico from the spanish inwhen puerto rico became an unincorporated u.s. territory meaning it is controlled by the united states but only selected parts of the constitution apply.
",
13797,1,," many believe that puerto rico should move beyond its status as a territory to become a state within the united states of america.
",
13798,1,," while a majority of puerto ricans have voted for continued status as a territory, there are rising calls for statehood.
",
13799,1,," the main questions include whether it is important for puerto ricans to gain full rights as citizens, and whether statehood is a superior means to achieving this than independence.
",
13800,1,," others include whether puerto rico will gain economically from statehood (verses the status quo and independence).
",
13801,1,," socially and culturally, is puerto rico consistent with the characteristics that have defined other states entering the united states, such as alaska or hawaii?
",
13802,1,," will english be the primary language, or a co-official language along with spanish?
",
13803,1,," and this raises the question, is english the only possible official language possible in a us state - as english-only advocates would have it - or is it possible to have another language as an official language as well?
",
13804,1,," are there cultural concerns for puerto ricans who have a strong national identity?
",
13805,1,," finally, will democrats or republicans benefit more politically from puerto rican statehood?
",
13806,1,," is there a self-motivated bias coming from american politicians pushing for puerto rican statehood?
",
13807,1,,"although puerto rico voted in novemberto become a state this does not end the debate.
",
13808,1,," president obama has promised to respect the will of the islanders on the issue so removing one possible obstacle but there is still the us congress to negotiate.
",
13809,1,," congress only needs a simple majority in both houses but that may not be simple as republicans assume the new state would be democrat and currently control the house.
",
13810,1,," the referendum is also less clear than it might be as although 54% voted for change on a first question the option of statehood got less than 50% of all voters if those who voted on the first question but not on the second are counted.
",
13811,0,," currently , puerto ricans do not receive full political rights and equal representation , despite their american citizenship .
",
13812,0,," although it has its own governor and legislature which handles some domestic matters , inhabitants of puerto rico receive no say in us federal matters or foreign policy , despite being heavily affected by them , more so than most current american states , as puerto rico sits in the caribbean surrounded by other island nation-states .
",
13813,0,," if puerto rico became a us state , puerto ricans would then share as everyone else in full benefits from the us government , while paying taxes like everyone else .
",
13814,0,," the status quo perpetuates a semi-colonial situation in puerto rico , where american citizenship , which they have held since, carries fewer rights than in the us proper .
",
13815,0,," this has been the situation since the us captured puerto rico in, and no other us territory has been held in limbo like this for so long .
",
13816,0,," during this time puerto ricans have supported the us by serving in large numbers , both voluntarily and through conscription , in the us military in every major war since the spanish-american war .
",
13817,0,," however the island 's current status still prompts united nations to still debate whether puerto rico is a colony .
",
13818,0,," us congressional inquest into puerto rico 's political situation has found that , despite the divergent views that puerto ricans have with respect to their preferred political status , `` all factions agree on the need to end the present undemocratic arrangement whereby puerto rico is subject to the laws of congress but can not vote in it . ''
",
13819,0,," the former chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court , jose trias monge , has written a book on the political status of puerto rico entitled `` puerto rico : the trials of the oldest colony in the world . ''
",
13820,0,," therein he argued that just prior to the u.s. invasion , the island enjoyed greater freedom and rights in certain areas than it does now , including an insular parliament that could legislate in matters of monetary policy , banking , import/export duties , and public credit ; the ability of puerto rico to negotiate its own commercial treaties ; puerto ricans were spanish citizens , equal in all respects to mainland spanish citizens ; the spanish constitution applied in puerto rico in the same manner as it applied in spain proper ; the autonomic charter of, which governed puerto rico 's relation with spain , could not be changed except with puerto rico 's consent .
",
13821,0,," the political rights currently enjoyed by puerto ricans , such as their right to elect their own governor , are not even guaranteed to them in the status quo .
",
13822,0,," in, the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice .
",
13823,0,," to perpetuate this current second-class status is morally unacceptable in a nation which pledges itself to `` liberty and justice for all '' .
",
13824,0,," american statehood would lead to significant economic growth for puerto rico .
",
13825,0,," statehood would mean that the island would shed its ineffective and costly reliance on preferential tax credits and more fully integrate into the national economy .
",
13826,0,," in a study by hexner , jenkins , lad and lame , `` puerto rican statehood : a precondition to sound economic growth , '' the case is persuasively made that statehood is necessary for the island 's economic growth .
",
13827,0,," as an american state , the standard of living in puerto rico would profoundly improve for the average person .
",
13828,0,," with average income going up , families would be able to pay their fair share of taxes while still improving their net income and standard of living .
",
13829,0,," for those with low incomes , the u.s. citizens of puerto rico would have the same access to tax relief and federal support programs as any other citizen of the country , unlike under the present status where significant disparities exist .
",
13830,0,," this is particularly significant as approximately% of puerto ricans live under the federal poverty line .
",
13831,0,," many areas of us federal funding to puerto rico would actually improve .
",
13832,0,," for example , the currentstates can receive up to% reimbursement through medicaid for critical health information technologies ; puerto rico is not eligible for these supplements .
",
13833,0,," according tocongressional testimony by governor anibal acevedo-vila , had puerto rico been treated like the other states , it would have received $ 1.7 billion dollars in federal medicaid support instead of the $million received .
",
13834,0,," translated to monthly amounts , federal medicaid support in the states approximated $per month per participant ; the amount in puerto rico was about $per month .
",
13835,0,," the us is one of the richest countries on earth , and being a full part of it would give puerto ricans a lot of practical advantages that the independent countries of the spanish-speaking caribbean lack .
",
13836,0,," the right to move to the us-proper and work there legally , for example , is extremely valuable .
",
13837,0,," overall , therefore , there is a compelling economic case for puerto rico to seek american statehood .
",
13838,0,," some have made the argument that puerto rico should not be a state because puerto ricans do not speak english , and that the us should not have a non-english speaking state .
",
13839,0,," this argument does not hold up for the following reasons : english is already an official language on the island with the same status as spanish .
",
13840,0,," puerto ricans are already citizens of the u.s. , and have been since1917 .
",
13841,0,," there was no language requirement with the granting of citizenship then , so it makes no sense to ask this question now .
",
13842,0,," in fact , there has never been a language requirement of territories entering the union in american history .
",
13843,0,," english is a required subject in public schools through high school .
",
13844,0,," english is the only language of the federal court system and all u.s. government agencies in puerto rico and is the common language in banking , commerce , real estate and the tourism industry .
",
13845,0,," learning english as well as spanish just makes good sense .
",
13846,0,," english is the international language of business , science , and increasingly , diplomacy .
",
13847,0,," puerto rico should do all it can to increase english language capability .
",
13848,0,," but , making it a requirement of statehood would ignore the precedents of enabling acts of louisiana , new mexico , oklahoma and arizona , all of which similarly had issues of large non-english speaking populations and gave or give these other languages some official status in law .
",
13849,1,,"the united states has perhaps the most arcane method of selecting its chief executive of any nation, one no country has chosen to emulate.
",
13850,1,,"   there are a total ofvotes in the electoral college, so a successful candidate needsto win.
",
13851,1,,"  because all but two states cast their electoral votes as a unit, a candidate can win some states by narrow margins, lose others by large margins, and thus win the electoral vote while losing the popular vote.
",
13852,1,,"  this last occurred in the election of george w. bush in 2000.
",
13853,1,,"the founders had no political theory or coherent design in creating the electoral college, but they did have a number of motivations for doing so.
",
13854,1,,"  some were concerned about legislative intrigue and executive dependence on the legislature, so they wanted some mode for choosing the president other than legislative selection.
",
13855,1,,"  others worried about mob rule if the voters directly selected the president and feared the electoral legitimacy direct election would provide the executive.
",
13856,1,,"  still others felt voters would not know of distinguished men in other parts of the country, requiring intermediaries to identify the best candidates.
",
13857,1,,"  finally, the electoral college was a mechanism to protect slave interests, because slave states would receive credit for three-fifths of their slaves in the apportionment of electoral votes even though the slaves could not vote in an election.
",
13858,1,,"  all of these intentions are now irrelevant in evaluating the electoral college.
",
13859,1,,"there is no question that it violates core democratic principles, such as equality in voting.
",
13860,1,,"  are there compensations for this violation that justify maintaining it?
",
13861,1,,"  supporters of the electoral college argue that it protects small states, forces candidates to seek broad support, and helps to maintain the two-party system.
",
13862,1,,"  opponents respond that the electoral college ensures that candidates ignore most of the country, especially small states, in their campaigning, as they attend only to swing states; and that the system encourages third parties.
",
13863,1,,"the electoral college has consistently proven to be unpopular with the public.
",
13864,1,,"  every gallup poll taken on the subject has found clear majorities supporting direct election of the president.
",
13865,1,,"the existence of the electoral college is an arcane piece of electoral history but one with important consequences.
",
13866,1,,"  as a result, it remains a hot button contemporary issue.
",
13867,0,,"  under the electoral college , all votes do not count equally .
",
13868,0,," voters in some states have more say in selecting the president than voters in other states .
",
13869,0,," for example , california haselectoral college votes , while delaware only getvotes .
",
13870,0,," there is not equality in that , every state should be equal , california for voting purposes is no more important that delaware .
",
13871,0,," in and probably, the candidate receiving the most votes for president lost the election .
",
13872,0,," this occurs because all but two states award all their electoral votes to the candidate winning a plurality in the state ; because all states receive two electoral votes corresponding to their two us senators ; because the number of house seats , which serve as the basis of the remaining electoral votes , often poorly match the population of the state ; because states cast electoral votes no matter how many people actually vote ; and because the size of the house is arbitrary .
",
13873,0,," this provision allows thesmallest states with a population of about 4.9 million to outvote thelargest states with a population ofmillion .
",
13874,0,," this is blatently unfair .
",
13875,0,," in, ralph nader siphoned a few votes from al gore in new hampshire and florida , costing gore victories and thus the election .
",
13876,0,," nevertheless , gore was the preferred choice of voters in a match up with george w. bush .
",
13877,0,," there is no incentive for candidates to mobilize voters in states they are sure to win -- or sure to lose , and voters have little incentive to vote in noncompetitive states where their vote is likely not to matter .
",
13878,0,," some states like texas just have a fairly predictable voting record - they have voted republicanout of the lastpresidential elections .
",
13879,0,," democratic presidential candidates do not spend much time in texas for that reason .
",
13880,1,,"the alternative vote (av) electoral system is currently used to elect representatives to australia's house of representatives.
",
13881,1,," it is sometimes called the instant run-off system (in america) or preferential voting (in australia).
",
13882,1,," many of those who are dissatisfied with the first past the post (fptp) electoral system used in the uk and usa argue for a change to av.
",
13883,1,," the uk labour party advocated av in their manifesto for thegeneral election, and the conservative-lib dem coalition held a referendum on changing the voting system for the uk house of commons to av on may 5th 2011.
",
13884,1,,"like the fptp system used in the usa and the uk, under av each constituency or electoral district elects one representative to the legislature (parliament, assembly or congress).
",
13885,1,," but fptp simply asks people to put a mark against the person they prefer.
",
13886,1,," for a candidate to win under fptp, they have to get more votes than any other candidate, meaning one may be declared the winner with less than 50% of the votes.
",
13887,1,," the alternative vote system differs by ensuring that the winner of each constituency has to have the support of over half the voters – for this reason it is classed as a majoritarian system.
",
13888,1,," av achieves this by asking each voter to rank the candidates in order of preference.
",
13889,1,," first preference votes are then counted and if one candidate has over 50% of votes cast, they are automatically declared the winner.
",
13890,1,," if no one has over half the votes cast, then the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated, and their votes given to the second-choice candidate on their voters’ ballot papers.
",
13891,1,," if after adding these redistributed votes one candidate now has over 50% of the votes, then they are declared the winner; if not, the remaining candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their ballot papers redistributed, and so on.
",
13892,0,," eventually one candidate must end up with the support of over half the voters, and so will represent that constituency/district in the legislature.
",
13893,0,,"under fptp , party representatives can focus on the concerns of% or so of citizens on whose vote they rely on for re-election .
",
13894,0,," this results in tribal politics .
",
13895,0,," av , in forcing mps to gain% of votes , forces them to consider those outside their core voters .
",
13896,0,," also , according to the jenkins report , see bibliography , av would be likely to create more marginal seats ; this is good for democracy .
",
13897,0,," parties currently place more extreme candidates in safe seats to ensure they get elected .
",
13898,0,," decreasing the number of safe seats is another way of ensuring that candidates have to address all members of their population and be accountable to all constituents .
",
13899,0,," the political studies association suggests that `` evidence from the uk and elsewhere suggests that mps in marginal seats do focus on servicing their constituency more than those in safe seats . ''
",
13900,0,," the current fptp system is undemocratic ; currently a majority government can be created with a minority of the vote , because mps are elected with less than% of the vote , lending their decisions little legitimacy .
",
13901,0,," `` according to figures from the electoral reform society ,mps , of, received less thanper cent of the vote '' at thegeneral election1 which means the majority of their constituents did not vote for them .
",
13902,0,," av ensures that elected representatives have the support the majority of their candidates because they have to get more than% of the vote .
",
13903,0,," this gives a stronger democratic mandate to those who are elected .
",
13904,0,," under the fptp electoral system , supporters of minority parties either waste their vote to support their ideals , or decide which of the leading parties they dislike lease and vote accordingly .
",
13905,0,," research reported by the british academy indicates that% of people voted for a party other than their most preferred in thegeneral election .1 this leaves voters unhappy at having to vote for the lesser of two evils .
",
13906,0,," this also perpetuates the tradition two-party politics in the uk , as it makes it hard for a third party to gain enough votes to break through nationally .
",
13907,0,," `` under av there would be no technical reason for voting tactically for your most preferred candidate .
",
13908,0,," ``av allows voters to express their preferences honestly , as their first preference vote can be a protest vote for a minority party ; when that is inevitably eliminated , their mainstream vote will still contribute to the result .
",
13909,0,," av encourages positive voting .
",
13910,0,," this also means that voters feel that all votes matter .
",
13911,0,," fptp disenfranchises many who do not vote for the two main parties .
",
13912,0,," it is still one person one vote , it is just that some people 's vote may be for different candidates in different rounds if their first preference has been eliminated .
",
13913,0,," everyone has a say in the final outcome .
",
13914,0,," unlike other proportional representation systems the alternative vote is easy to implement when changing from first past the post .
",
13915,0,," this is because av does not represent a very large change in terms of how the voting system would work .
",
13916,0,," av keeps the same constituencies so mps and candidates would be competing for the same votes they have always done .
",
13917,0,," voters would remain in the same constituency so preventing any confusion that would be involved in a fully proportional system .
",
13918,0,," the relative small change and therefore the ease to implement can be shown by the relatively small changes had thegeneral election been fought under av .
",
13919,0,," labour would have won ten fewer seats , the conservatives twenty three less and liberal democrats thirty two more .1 nobody disputes the fact that extreme right and left parties should be allowed representation if they can gain the support of a large enough section of the voting public .
",
13920,0,," irrespective of their views , parties must all be given an equal chance of representation .
",
13921,0,," ` better ' democracy must include extremism .
",
13922,0,," however , av makes it much less likely that extremist parties will be elected , as they are unlikely to get the required% support , instead of the 25-30 % they currently need if support for opposing parties is split .
",
13923,1,,"this is not a cost benefit analysis of whether catalonia should remain within spain as catalonia despite how much many catalans may wish for a vote on independence has yet to get that far.
",
13924,1,," instead for the moment the much more urgent question is whether the catalans should get their vote on independence at all; the catalans clearly say yes while the spanish government and the other regions are firmly against.
",
13925,1,," once the issue of whether a referendum should be had is resolved and accepted by both sides, or the issue become less relevant by proposals of unilateral catalan moves towards independence then this debate may become irrelevant and one about the costs and benefits of full independence much more necessary.
",
13926,1,,"in the early part of the 15th century what is now spain was still divided politically, catalonia was a part of the kingdom of aragon rather than the kingdom of castile.
",
13927,1,," inthe territories of the two kingdoms were united in a personal union through the marriage of the king of aragon ferdinand ii and queen of castile isabella.
",
13928,1,," their grandson charles i (usually known as charles v outside spain as a result of being holy roman emperor) became the king of both territories in 1516.
",
13929,1,," however each region within the kingdoms maintained considerable autonomy; for example taxes had to be sought through each regions cortes rather than nationally and the catalans in particular were often unwilling to pay for what they saw as castile’s empire.
",
13930,1,,"during the war of spanish succession catalonia first recognised philip v and then turned to the other claimant archduke charles when he entered catalonia.
",
13931,1,," philip however won the war and kept the entirety of peninsular spain in the treaty of utrecht on 1713.
",
13932,1,," having been on the losing side catalonia had its constitution and independent political structure abolished, and its culture and language suppressed.
",
13933,0,," ultimately despite being within spain so long as support for independence remains strong the catalans probably have more cards to play ; they provide more in taxes than they receive so could cut madrid off , or in the final play they could unilaterally secede leaving spain with the unpalatable option of either negotiating to get catalonia back in , accepting , or invading .
",
13934,1,,"states are self-governing political entities with the monopoly of the use of legitimate force within a given geographic space.1a federal state is made up of constituent federal units (for example, the states of the united states of america) which agree to run some or all of their functions through a higher federal body with authority over those areas.
",
13935,1,," this involves a formal agreement, often in the form of a constitution, which sets out the powers of the federal authority and constituent federal units.2 federal states can be contrasted with unitary states where the central government holds ultimate authority.
",
13936,1,," they can have sub-state units like federal states, but these have autonomy on the whim of the central authority rather than guaranteed constitutional legal rights.3nations are groups with strong cultural similarities through one or more factors such as common language, institutions, religion or historical experience.
",
13937,1,," nations with their own states are nation- states.
",
13938,1,," a good example of a nation-state is japan.
",
13939,1,," other states with multiple nations, such as the united kingdom, are multinational states.4this is about whether nations should prefer to be members of federal states, where they enjoy some autonomy, or attempt to exist independently as nation states.
",
13940,1,," biafra attempted to secede from nigeria betweenandin order to become an independent state for the igbo people.
",
13941,1,," this attempt was defeated by nigeria, and biafra was reabsorbed into nigeria.5
",
13942,1,,"presidents have for decades asked for the power to cancel individual items of appropriations, with ronald reagan being particular vigorous in his demands for line-item veto authority.
",
13943,1,," technically the power is not one of absolute veto but means that when signing a bill a president would be able to notify congress of his intention not to spend one or more items of appropriation within it.
",
13944,1,," the campaign for a line-item veto was particularly strong in the mid-1990s when federal budget deficits concentrated minds on the need to combat wasteful spending, something that is once again relevant.
",
13945,1,," it was a provision in the republican's winningcontract with america manifesto1, and enacted in 1996.
",
13946,1,," under the line item veto act president clinton vetoeditems of spending from theappropriations bills, representing $1.9 billion of savings over five years; in one case congress overrode his decision by majority votes in each chamber.
",
13947,1,," however, the act was challenged in federal court by two groups who would have benefited from appropriations that clinton had vetoed, and inthe supreme court found the line item veto act to be unconstitutional as congress was not allowed to give up some of its powers to the executive branch.2sincethere have been several attempts to revisit the issue, with significant proposals inandof new bills that attempted to provide the president with line-item veto power in ways that could be considered constitutional.
",
13948,1,," these failed to become law and it is possible that the only way to create such a power is by amending the us constitution itself (as the supreme court decision noted in 1998).
",
13949,1,," as the federal deficit has once again grown and government waste has become a major political issue, there are renewed calls for a line-item veto to be introduced.
",
13950,1,,"this is potentially quite a technical debate but speakers would be well advised to base their case upon the main principles at stake.
",
13951,1,," it is worth noting that theact allowed clinton the power to cancel not only items in appropriations bills but also tax breaks affecting only small numbers of people.
",
13952,1,," and it gave him authority to cancel items directing government expenditure within committee reports accompanying spending bills, which by convention have been accepted by presidents as binding in the same way as appropriations in acts are.
",
13953,1,," whether a proposed constitutional amendment would have the same scope is a matter for argument among experts.
",
13954,0,," although the potential for the veto is important most spending is not through appropriations at all, but on entitlements such as medicare and social security that are legislated in different ways and which would not be covered by either theact or more recent proposals to enhance presidential budgeting power.
",
13955,0,,"the present system of earmarking in congress is wide open to abuse .
",
13956,0,," the party leaderships in each house can use the offer of pork , or the threat to withhold it to enforce party discipline .
",
13957,0,," `` logrolling '' occurs whereby an earmark is obtained in return for support on an unrelated piece of legislation .
",
13958,0,," all this leads to legislators who put party above country and vote for bad legislation in pursuit of their own vested interest .
",
13959,0,," they basically `` are federal dollars that members of congress dole out to favor seekers -- often campaign donors .
",
13960,0,," in the process , lawmakers advocate for the companies , helping them bypass the normal system of evaluation and competition . ''
",
13961,0,," 1 forcing pork out in the open by making congress vote to defend it after a presidential line-item veto is the best way to remedy matters .
",
13962,0,," overall the president is more accountable to the people as a whole than individual representatives , and with their national mandate , more able to stand up to powerful interest groups .
",
13963,0,," the line item veto could prevent omnibus appropriations bills as with a possible veto there would be little advantage to congress in bundling such spending together .
",
13964,0,," in recent decades , huge omnibus appropriations bills have become the norm , these are bills that `` package many , often unrelated , proposals in a single , very long piece of legislation ``.
",
13965,0,," presidents have had to accept these bills in their entirety or see the federal government shut down for lack of spending authority .
",
13966,0,," presidents from the 1790s tohad an impoundment power not to spend money which congress had appropriated .
",
13967,0,," this power was lost in, with increasingly bloated budgets and pork barrel spending the result .
",
13968,0,," congressman phil english has said that `` for far too long , presidents have had to adopt an '' all or nothing '' approach when considering action on bills containing appropriations .
",
13969,0,," this presents a predicament for them when good policies are overloaded by unnecessary spending proposals .
",
13970,0,," the case for this amendment was clearly demonstrated by the fy99 omnibus appropriations act last october .
",
13971,0,," many provisions in this bill were last minute '' pork '' projects that should not have been included .
",
13972,0,," ``amending the us constitution to allow the president a line-item veto would be fiscally responsible .
",
13973,0,," congress has proved itself incapable of restraining spending , even as the budget deficit has ballooned in recent years .
",
13974,0,," in fiscal yearthere were 11,610 earmarks -- specific appropriations requested by individual congressmen , mostly to benefit specific groups in their district or state - costing $ 17.2 billion with a total of $billion fromto 2008.1 many of these items are `` pork '' , using taxpayers ' money on projects of dubious value in order to ingratiate the congressman involved with groups of voters or interest groups .
",
13975,0,," typically huge spending bills bloated with such wasteful appropriations are voted through by congressmen who have no opportunity or inclination to even read the whole thing .
",
13976,0,," at present the president has to accept or sign the whole bill , despite their distaste for many of the items within it .
",
13977,0,," the proposed amendment would change that and allow the president to sign the bill as a whole , while cancelling spending he regarded as wasteful , of low priority , or properly a matter for state or local government .
",
13978,0,," all that is being proposed here is giving the president the same power enjoyed byout ofstate governors .
",
13979,0,," one strength of a federal system is the way `` our states are our laboratories of democracy and we can look to them for the best practices and innovative ideas . ''
",
13980,0,," they point the way to solutions that others , including the federal government , can adopt .
",
13981,0,," and at state level the line-item veto power is very valuable in restraining spending and preventing waste ; congressman john baldacci argues that `` unlike the federal government , the states by and large do not run deficits and they keep their books in order and spend only what they have each year .
",
13982,0,," they pass realistic budgets and they stick to them .
",
13983,0,," it is certain that this authority is a crucial part of keeping spending in check .
",
13984,0,," while it may not be used with great regularity in many states , the fact that it is available encourages the legislatures and the governor to reach agreement on spending issues and not to crowd the spending with extraneous matters .
",
13985,0,," ``because it is used irregularly there has been no general erosion of legislative authority within these states .
",
13986,1,,"the house of lords is seen by some as an antiquated addition to our government structure, a mockery of modern democracy and an inhibiting influence in the drive for progress.
",
13987,1,," while the function of a second chamber is recognised as beneficial as it ensures checks and balances on the activity of the house of commons, the composition of its members reflects a society long past, a reminder of a time when equality was not a social aspiration.
",
13988,1,," new labour’s first stage of reform indid some work to reduce hereditary peers in the house of lords (now standing at 92), but since then the gradual phasing in of reforms that was proposed has failed to materialise.
",
13989,1,," many advocates of democracy and the right of law are now calling for these reforms to be completed, to abolish members of birth right and to introduce an electorally voted body to ensure that the house of lords is as fully democratic as the rest of our country claims to be.
",
13990,1,," deputy prime minister nick clegg presented the house of lords reform draft bill and the accompanying white paper to parliament onmay 2011.
",
13991,1,," it proposed reform to a smaller, 80%-elected house with 15-year maximum terms for elected peers.
",
13992,1,," whether or not this bill will be met with enthusiasm, apathy or disdain, and whether or not it will prove to the greater good for the house of lords and government of britain, is yet to be seen.
",
13993,0,," the house of lords is undemocratic .
",
13994,0,," currently the members of the house of lords consist of hereditary peers , senior members of the church of england and those appointed by political parties .
",
13995,0,," whether or not there is an abuse of power or the outcome of the house of lords is beside the point -- its very existence in its current state is undemocratic and as such it should be reformed .
",
13996,0,," it seems nonsensical that a country that lectures to the rest of the world the importance of democracy , to the point of war , should overlook such a grievance in their own society .
",
13997,0,," the 19th century us president abraham lincoln stated that democracy should be ` government of the people , by the people , for the people ' therefore peers who sit in the house based on noble birth right or their membership of the church of england , that is itself largely ignored by the people , do not represent the people of britain .
",
13998,0,," the traditional provenance of the house of lords translates to an in-built conservative majority .
",
13999,0,," even so called liberal and labour peers are usually conservative in their opinions .
",
14000,0,," they represent a social and economic elite and seem to flaunt diversity monitoring in a house with onlyfemale peers and a staggeringly lowpeers from ethnic minorities .
",
14001,0,," this unfair skew in the favour of the conservative has the power to slow down and revise legislation and is a gross misrepresentation of the british population .
",
14002,0,," the house of lords should be reformed in order to better reflect the british people so that their actions and decisions benefit the whole of society and not just their own .
",
14003,0,," reform of the house of lords would strengthen the legitimacy of the house and therefore improve its functions .
",
14004,0,," by electing the second chamber they would gain the legitimacy to not simply stall bills but reject them all together or drafts bills of their own , thus facilitating a more dynamic government , able to change .
",
14005,0,," using a different electoral technique , for example proportional representation with members sitting for longer periods would allow them to still be of a different composition to the house of commons and not sway to short-term political popularity .
",
14006,0,," electing different portions at different times would also guard against a freak landslide result affecting the house 's balance .
",
14007,0,," by creating a worthy opposition to the house of commons all issues would be debated and decided upon more fairly and government would be more closely monitored .
",
14008,1,,"all liberal democratic states are reliant on employing large numbers of their citizens in order to execute the policies formulated by their legislative and executive branches.
",
14009,1,," many public sector organisations, such as police forces and the prison services, operate as extensions of the executive, using the executive’s right to deploy power and coercion to enforce the state’s laws.
",
14010,1,," other public sector organisations fulfil vital social needs, by providing healthcare and education to citizens.
",
14011,1,," a dedicated bureaucratic and technocratic service, usually called a civil service, may be employed to provide independent advice and administrative support to elected leaders.
",
14012,1,,"although the leaders and senior staff of liberal democracies are elected on a politically partisan basis, as a general principle public sector organisations do not pursue their own political agendas.
",
14013,1,," public sector organisations exist to carry out the instructions of elected political leaders.
",
14014,1,,"individuals employed by the various branches of liberal democratic states are allowed to retain their political autonomy and their rights as citizens.
",
14015,1,," concepts such as rule-of-law ensure that all the occupants of a state, whether part of the government or not, are accorded equal protection under the law.
",
14016,1,," even so, some limits may be placed on government employee’s freedom to criticise the state.
",
14017,1,," impartial civil services, such as the crown’s civil service in the uk, may require their staff to refrain from participating in public and high profile political campaigning.
",
14018,1,," alternately some executive branches may employ their own, partisan administrative staff.
",
14019,1,,"individuals employed by liberal states remain free to hold beliefs and expression opinions that dissent from the political ideology of the states’ elected governments.
",
14020,1,," they are also free- thanks to the democratic norm of free speech- to express opinions that dissent from the liberal democratic paradigm.
",
14021,1,,"public debate following the leak quickly became focussed on whether governments have a right to vet the political beliefs and associations of their employees.
",
14022,1,,"screening of employees political beliefs seems especially pertinent in states where free speech laws allow citizens to freely associate with political groups opposed to the protection of free speech and other core constitutional principles.
",
14023,1,,"restrictions on the political activities of state employees vary from country to country.
",
14024,1,," rules restricting state employee’s political activities in the uk are relatively unobtrusive.
",
14025,1,," inthe association of chief police officers agreed that all uk police forces would dismiss officers revealed to be members of the bnp.
",
14026,1,," the acpo’s decision explicitly referenced the police services’ obligation, under the race relations amendment act 2000, to promote peaceful, equitable and equal relations between different racial groups.
",
14027,1,," inthe established church of england voted to ban its clergy from joining the bnp.
",
14028,1,,"the proposition side definition of an extremist political party is likely to vary from debate to debate, but competent speakers should aim to define heterodox political thought in relation to accepted western liberal democratic norms.
",
14029,1,," political movements that advocate the abolition of racial equality laws serve as one example of extremism.
",
14030,1,," however, it may also be productive to discuss left and liberal extremists.
",
14031,1,," a student trotskyist who advocates the creation of a communist state by armed insurrection is also an extremist.
",
14032,1,," such an individual holds views that are in radical opposition to both liberal norms and to the democratic structures that allow him to express those views.
",
14033,1,,"extremist political movements may also be identified by their intransigent or inflexible adherence to political controversial ideologies.
",
14034,1,," this definition can be useful when discussing the political counterparts of extreme religious groups or ethnic identity groups.
",
14035,1,,"certain provinces and states in canada and australia protect public employees from being discriminated against on the grounds of their political beliefs.
",
14036,1,," similar rules apply in new zealand and in northern ireland.
",
14037,0,,"  government employees are , ultimately , duty bound to uphold the policies and principles implemented by the executive branch .
",
14038,0,," the executive is limited in its range of action -- it is necessary to delegate certain of its duties to bodies such as the police , the military and the education services .
",
14039,0,," as representatives of the government , employees whom obstruct or attempt to subvert the laws that it implements are effectively obstructing the liberal autonomy of the fellow citizens .
",
14040,0,," the executive is elected and empowered on the basis that it will bring about certain changes to law and society that have been mandated by the electorate .
",
14041,0,," the executive is also given the authority to act to fulfil broader , more aspiration goals that echo the desires and objectives of society as a whole .
",
14042,0,," at every stage in its life cycle , a state remains democratically accountable .
",
14043,0,," politicians undertake to set personal ambition aside and to act as representatives of the popular will -- their own values and political beliefs take second place to the beliefs articulated by the electorate .
",
14044,0,," a government would be completely ineffective , and would rapidly loose the confidence of the electorate if it enacted policies according to the personal preference of its members .
",
14045,0,," similarly , the groups and individuals to whom the government 's power is delegated can also undermine its mandate if they also refuse to impartially implemented democratically sanctioned laws and policies .
",
14046,0,," political parties also function as peer networks .
",
14047,0,," membership of a party gives individuals a certain sense of belonging and allows them to influence and define the identity of other members .
",
14048,0,," members of extremist parties who do not want to use their position to promote extreme views are likely to come under pressure from other party members to do so .
",
14049,0,," even if a member of an extremist party vows that he will not abuse his role as a teacher or a civil servant , others who share his beliefs will try to convince him to do so .
",
14050,0,," allowing teachers and youth leaders to be members of extremist political groups presents a significant risk to children and young adults .
",
14051,0,," there is , of course , an unsubtle point to be made about the possibility that teachers with extremist views may attempt to indoctrinate their charges .
",
14052,0,," teachers hold positions of respect and authority within educational institutions .
",
14053,0,," they are trusted uncritically ; they are tasked with providing children with the cognitive tools that they will use to evaluate the beliefs and controversies they will encounter throughout their lives .
",
14054,0,," teachers can be a source of inspiration and can foster aspiration .
",
14055,0,," teachers may also engage in racial motivated bullying among their peers , disrupting the confidence and authority of their colleagues .
",
14056,0,," attacks and bias of this type often prove hard to detect , as many racial minorities contain disproportionately large numbers of vulnerable families and children .
",
14057,0,," whether put at risk by economic and cultural marginalisation or by the legal and political quagmire surrounding the status of non eu migrants , the children of minority groups are often confronted with wide ranging and institutionalised prejudice outside of the classroom environment .
",
14058,0,," it is not acceptable to expose them to the danger of racial discrimination by their teachers .
",
14059,0,," it is often unclear whether extremist political organisations are likely to become violent or to engage in provocative acts of hate speech .
",
14060,0,," although the state does not have a right to obstruct or prevent such organisations from meeting or protesting , it does have a right to control the manner and circumstances in which such meetings take place .
",
14061,0,," doing so ensures that citizens who do not want to be involved in , or whose activities and freedoms might be materially affected by the articulation of extremist views can go about their business without hindrance .
",
14062,0,," part of the state 's role is to balance these sets of incommensurate rights .
",
14063,0,," all western liberal democracies use their police forces to enforce this balance .
",
14064,0,," it is possible that a conflict of interest could arise between the political views of a police officer or a state solicitor responsible for overseeing the circumstances in which a rally or gathering will take place and the balancing role of the state .
",
14065,0,," a police officer with links to an extremist party may , conceivably , be made responsible for policing the conduct of friends and political allies .
",
14066,0,," if such a situation was to arise , the capability of the officer to make appropriately impartial , value neutral decisions about the types of activity that would be permitted at such a demonstration might be compromised .
",
14067,0,," even if the officer expressly adopts a neutral stance , personal ideological bias may still lead him to perceive a demonstration by his friends and allies as inherently less threatening or in need of oversight than a protest mounted by another organisation .
",
14068,0,," not only will this undermine the police 's ability to supervise and regulate individual 's democratic rights , it will also have an impact on the perspective that ordinary people adopt in relation to the state .
",
14069,0,," marginalised citizens may be less willing to approach police officer 's for help if they are aware that their bias 's go unchallenged .
",
14070,0,," one of the causes of the marginalisation of minority groups is bias in service provision among civilian service providers -- suspicion of similar bias amongst the police may create a culture of distrust among many minority groups .
",
14071,1,,"a recall election is a form of direct democracy in which citizens are able to cut short the term of an elected representative through a public vote.
",
14072,1,," particular mechanisms vary, but usually involve a petition signed by members of the public.
",
14073,1,," if a sufficient proportion of the electorate signs the petition the recall process is triggered and a special election is called to decide whether the representative concerned should be removed from office.
",
14074,1,," in some systems (e.g. venezuela) this is essentially a straightforward referendum on the politician; if the recall initiative is passed then their office becomes vacant and a new election is held later to decide who should fill it.
",
14075,1,," in other versions of the recall process (e.g the philippines) , the incumbent is placed on a ballot alongside a number of challengers; if the current representative receives the most votes they keep their office, but if someone else gains more votes than they do, they are lose office and are replaced by the successful challenger.
",
14076,1,," in california a two-part ballot requires voters first to decide on whether the incumbent should be dismissed, and then to vote for a replacement should the first question be passed.
",
14077,1,," recall procedures are used in a small number of countries.
",
14078,1,,"states in the usa allow recall votes for county or city officials, but onlyhave provisions to recall state legislators or governors (recalls are not used for federal positions).
",
14079,1,," only two us governors have ever been recalled, the most recent being gray davis of california who was removed from office inand replaced by arnold schwarzenegger.
",
14080,1,," parts of switzerland and british columbia in canada also have recall mechanisms, as do venezuela and the philippines.
",
14081,1,," ina house of commons expenses scandal in the united kingdom tarnished the reputation of many british members of parliament, and led to calls for recall mechanisms to be introduced.
",
14082,1,," because the exact nature of recall systems varies widely from place to place, the proposition should devote some thought to defining what kind of mechanism they would put in place.
",
14083,1,," nonetheless, it is important to argue the  basis of broad principles that apply to all recall systems; the arguments below should apply in almost all cases.
",
14084,1,," note that as recall votes are a form of direct democracy, many of the wider arguments that are used in debates about referendums and initiatives also apply here.
",
14085,1,,"the law may require a certain percentage of adult citizens to sign a petition to trigger a recall (3%-7% in switzerland, depending on the canton) or a certain percentage of the number of votes cast in the election of the incumbent (as in california, which requires 12%).
",
14086,1,," the mechanism can demand the removal of office in one ballot and the appointment of the next politician in a separate one.
",
14087,1,," additionally, the laws may differ in the conditions they place on someone’s running for office.
",
14088,0,," elections only come around every four years or so , allowing unethical or incompetent politicians to do a lot of damage in office before facing the judgment of their constituents .
",
14089,0,," and after three years or so , many voters may have forgotten about their offending behavior , allowing them to get away with it .
",
14090,0,," in any case , regular elections seldom focus on the record of one particular candidate for a legislature , but are a referendum on their party as a whole .
",
14091,0,," if their party remains popular , or if their seat is a safe one , then incompetent and unethical politicians will often be re-elected regardless of their personal failings .
",
14092,0,," such was the case in california , where immediately before the recall , gray davis , a democrat , was re-elected simply because the local republican party had self-destructed .
",
14093,0,," people today are apathetic and distrustful about politics , which is very unhealthy for a democracy .
",
14094,0,," low turnouts in elections mean that governments today lack moral authority .
",
14095,0,," giving people more direct control would create more interest in politics , and get more people educated and active about the issues that affect them .
",
14096,0,," in other words , allowing recall elections will help to restore faith in politics and encourage active citizenship .
",
14097,0,," enabling ordinary voters to sack unsatisfactory representatives will give them an incentive to monitor what their politicians are doing in office , and will encourage the media to cover legislative affairs more fully than they do at present .
",
14098,0,," having a recall mechanism focuses the minds of elected representatives and ensures that they keep the interests of their constituents constantly in mind .
",
14099,0,," not only will this lead to harder working politicians with higher ethical standards , it will also prevent them selling out to lobby groups and party whips .
",
14100,0,," all too often elected representatives give way to the lure of `` business as usual '' in the capital city , and forget the folks who sent them there in the first place .
",
14101,0,," a system which provides the opportunity for a recall will give voters more power than what they currently have -- cast a ballot once every four or five years .
",
14102,0,," for the reasons outlined above , i.e. that voters may simply lack quality of choice in election time , giving them the ability to demand a recall decreases the democratic deficit .
",
14103,1,,"in many democracies, the legislature consists of two separate ‘chambers’ or ‘houses’.
",
14104,1,," this practice is called ‘bicameralism’.
",
14105,1,," usually, the lower house is directly elected by the people.
",
14106,1,," in the past, membership of the upper house was hereditary, like the house of lords in the united kingdom, which today still had hereditary seats, or japan’s house of peers, which untilwas hereditary.
",
14107,1,," nowadays the upper house is usually either appointed by another governing body, or indirectly elected.
",
14108,1,,"an example of an appointed upper house is the senate of canada.
",
14109,1,," in this system, each major area in canada hasseats.
",
14110,1,," members are appointed by the governor general (a largely ceremonial function) on the ‘advice’ the prime minister (so, practically the prime minister appoints the members) and remain in their seats until they reach the age of 75.
",
14111,1,,"an example of an indirectly elected upper house is the dutch ‘eerste kamer’.
",
14112,1,," in this system,  each province has an allotted number of seats based on their respective population sizes.
",
14113,1,," members for the seats are then chosen via election by the provincial legislatures and remain in their seats until the next provincial elections, after which the renewed provincial legislatures will hold a new election for the upper house.
",
14114,1,,"this case argues that the upper house should be directly elected by the people, just as the lower house, but via a different voting system.
",
14115,1,," an example of this is the united states senate (upper house) vis-à-vis the united states house of representatives (lower house).
",
14116,1,," whereas in the house of representatives each state has seats apportioned according to their population size, in the senate each state is represented by two senators, regardless of their population size.
",
14117,1,," because the direct election system for both the lower and upper house can vary in different legislatures, i am not going to specify which exact voting system the upper house will be using – i only assume that it is a direct voting system different from the direct voting system for the lower house.
",
14118,1,,"the upper house and lower house can also differ in the amount of legislative power they have.
",
14119,1,," usually, in so-called presidential systems, where the executive is directly elected, the upper house has equal legislative powers as the lower house.
",
14120,1,," for example, the united states senate is generally equal to, and in some special cases even more powerful than, the house of representatives.
",
14121,1,," in many parliamentary systems, where the executive is derived from the lower house, the upper house usually has less powers then the lower house.
",
14122,1,," for example, the senate of canada, unlike the house of canada, can’t force the prime minister to resign.
",
14123,1,," the dutch ‘eerste kamer’ can’t initiate legislation whereas the ‘tweede kamer’ can.
",
14124,0,,"this case also makes no choice as to what the exact division of powers should be between the separate houses and focuses only on the question whether it should be directly elected by the people or not.
",
14125,0,,"democracy means self-governance by the people , wherein citizens have the fundamental right to decide how they are to be governed and by whom .
",
14126,0,," an appointed or indirectly elected upper house violates this principle , because allows a group of individuals to exercise power without having to explain or justify themselves to the public .
",
14127,0,," when an upper house is directly elected , it will be perceived to be more legitimate by the public , because the public sees their political views directly translated into a legislative branch , albeit in a different way than the lower house .
",
14128,0,," this enhanced legitimacy will help the upper house in performing their constitutional duties : whenever the upper house disagrees with either the lower house or the executive , the upper house can now strengthen their position by pointing to the public support it has .
",
14129,0,," politicians who elect or appoint the members of the upper house have an incentive to put their friends an allies there , because this will make their decision making easier .
",
14130,0,," this is patronage pure and simple : the public will have a hard time sending them away when , if ever , a scandal breaks because the members of the upper house do n't depend on public opinion to remain in their seats .
",
14131,0,," an example is the case of a senator in the netherlands , sam pormes .
",
14132,0,," after an opinion magazine revealed he once had partaken in terrorist activities , it took almost a year and several mediation attempts to get him removed from parliament .
",
14133,1,,"national missile defense programs represent efforts to build and deploy ballistic missile interceptors.
",
14134,1,," since the reagan administration, the united states has, under various guises, sought to develop technology that would render enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles non-threatening to its people and interests.
",
14135,1,," from the outset, the development of such defensive armaments has been controversial.
",
14136,1,," were they to be implemented, they would render the nuclear deterrent capability of countries meaningless.
",
14137,1,," some believe this would make the world safer, generally rendering nuclear weapons useless.
",
14138,1,," others believe that it will only be a catalyst for war, as countries seek to penetrate one another’s strategic missile defenses.
",
14139,0,," debates hinge around both the efficacy of anti-ballistic missile technology, and whether their implementation will create conflict or be a tool for peace.
",
14140,0,,"the nation-state is the fundamental building block of the international system , and is recognized as such in all international treaties and organizations , mearsheimer  .
",
14141,0,," states are recognized as having the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of a strategic national missile defense system .
",
14142,0,," the united states has every right to develop such a system if it will furnish a greater measure of defense for its citizens and interests .
",
14143,0,," us military technology is the most advanced and prodigiously financed in the world , which is why it is generally the united states that stands at the forefront of new defense and combat systems .
",
14144,0,," the national missile defense program is simply the newest tool in the arsenal of the world 's greatest military , whose purpose is entirely defensive .
",
14145,0,," to shield itself from potential ballistic missile , and even nuclear , attack the united states has the right to build a missile shield to defend itself and its allies under its aegis .
",
14146,0,," there is no principled justification for a country to not pursue defense initiatives that benefit itself and that it wishes to pursue .
",
14147,0,," the missile defense shield the united states intends to build is the most effective and complete ballistic missile shield ever devised .
",
14148,0,," when fully armed with a complement of anti-ballistic missiles both within the united states itself , and in allied nations in europe , the shield will be virtually impregnable to external missile attack .
",
14149,0,," this means the chance of a nuclear attack succeeding against it will be very unlikely , reducing the chance not only of a full-scale nuclear war between the united states and another nuclear power , but also against missiles fired by rogue states or terrorists , the biggest threats in terms of actual use of nuclear weapons , the economist  .
",
14150,0,," technologically speaking , anti-ballistic missile missiles have developed by leaps and bounds in recent years .
",
14151,0,," the current system being put into operation by the united states is the aegis combat system , designed for deployment on us naval vessels .
",
14152,0,," this new development has served to sidestep the problems associated with ground and space-based missile defense arrays , due to the slow response time of ground missiles , and the still unfeasible orbital deployment .
",
14153,0,," the sea-based defense array , furthermore , lacks the problem of the land-based system in that it does not need to be placed in countries other than the united states in order to be effective , thus avoiding the political problems of the past .
",
14154,0,," technology and diplomacy have clearly made a national missile defense system highly desirable .
",
14155,0,," with a fully functioning missile defense shield deployed , nuclear-armed ballistic missiles become obsolete , unable to ever reach their targets .
",
14156,0,," this means countries ' strategic obsession with second-strike capacity , the ability to return fire with nuclear weapons should they be attacked by them , mutually assured destruction , will cease to be an issue , as first-strikes are destined to be wiped out before they hit a single target .
",
14157,0,," what this means is that countries with missile defense systems can feel secure without the need of retaining massive nuclear arsenals .
",
14158,0,," this will alleviate the pressure to have stockpiles of warheads and will promote disarmament .
",
14159,0,," mutually assured destruction has become a far less secure strategy as nuclear proliferation has occurred to states with different strategic conceptions .
",
14160,0,," this has been seen in the united states , which since its full adoption of the aegis system has actively pursued a policy of reaching a new accord with russia on nuclear arms reduction .
",
14161,0,," this culminated inwith the signing of the new start , strategic arms reduction treaty , an accord to reduce the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers by half , associated press  .
",
14162,0,," this new step toward nuclear disarmament could not be politically possible in the united states without a replacement defense , which only a national missile defense system can provide .
",
14163,0,," an operational national missile defense system renders nuclear weapons , and intercontinental ballistic missiles generally , obsolete .
",
14164,0,," when a country can shoot down all enemy missiles , those weapons lose their power .
",
14165,0,," the future of war , once countries have access to the technology to build missile shields , will no longer be marked by fingers held over the proverbial red button .
",
14166,0,," rather , the incentive for conflict between states armed with effective missile defenses will be to seek diplomatic solutions to problems .
",
14167,0,," the technology will likely be in the hands of many nations very soon , as the united states has already provided the technology to japan and australia , and will be building defense batteries in romania from, mcmichael  .
",
14168,0,," furthermore , even should war break out , they will necessarily be far less destructive , as they will not feature the city-leveling power of nuclear missiles .
",
14169,0,," with missile defense , war will be less likely and , should it occur , less destructive .
",
14170,0,," the union has now passed its 300th birthday and throughout that time scotland has maintained as distinct role and identity .
",
14171,0,," this is grounded in a tradition and history that is quite different from that south of the border and includes legal and education systems that have always been separate .
",
14172,0,," that has manifested itself in a distinct policy agenda since devolution and areas such as free care for the elderly and the abolition of student tuition fees .
",
14173,0,," not only has the policy agenda been different in scotland but so has the model of politics .
",
14174,0,," it has seen the emergence of new political parties and a better representation of the diversity within existing ones .
",
14175,0,," the contrast between the coalition governments at holyrood , the scottish parliament , where scottish labour and the scottish liberal democrats were allied betweenand, and the internecine warfare going on between conservative and liberal members of the current westminster coalition could not be more stark .
",
14176,0,," many of scotland 's problems are grounded in the fact that its potential has consistently been held back .
",
14177,0,," because the focus for economic development from a westminster perspective has focused for generations on north sea oil and the coal fields of lanarkshire , huge opportunities were missed and the best and the brightest tended be dragged down south for jobs worthy of their skills .
",
14178,1,,"however, for all of the confusion, in political terms it can simply be considered a desire to have as little intervention by others into individuals lives as possible.
",
14179,1,," a libertarian need not give up either his seat in congress nor his chair at mit.
",
14180,1,," it would be easy to portray libertarians as fanatics living in a cabin in montana with nothing butshotguns, a lifetime’s supply of tinned meat and a stove to keep them warm but the reality could not be further from that stereotype.
",
14181,1,,"this is not a one off flight of fancy for rep. paul.
",
14182,1,," inhe joined forces with sen. sanders (i-vt), the only openly socialist member of the senate to call for an investigation into the federal reserve system.
",
14183,1,,"so what could possibly bring together figures like this with laissez-faire businessmen like michael badnarik (libertarian presidential candidate in 2004) and bob barr (lib 2008) who, as a republican congressman, was one of the most vociferous critics of clinton and attained prominence as a national figure for his dogged determination to impeach clinton over the lewinsky affair.
",
14184,1,,"libertarianism can be approached from either the left or right but perhaps the best definition is that, regardless of their traditional background, they see the primary role of government and citizens as being to ensure that there is as much space as possible between the interventions of corporations and the state for people to live their lives in.
",
14185,1,," unsurprisingly those from a background on the right tend to want to push the state away a little more and those from the left tend to focus their attentions on corporations.
",
14186,1,," however, for the most part, both groups would suggest that there is no meaningful distinction between the two; nader commented on the suggestion that he was spoiling gore’s chances in theelection ""there is a difference between tweedledum and tweedledee, but not that much.
",
14187,1,,"""generally libertarians of all persuasions could sign up to that sentiment.
",
14188,1,,"their critics would allege that this was a sign that extremists from both wings were huddling together for warmth and votes but with an ever diminishing share of the vote for the two main parties the role of this anti-government and anti-corporate bloc may become a factor in forthcoming elections.
",
14189,0,," a sensible libertarian position accepts the rights of people to do whatever they like as long as it does n't infringe upon the life of anyone else .
",
14190,0,," that may sound like something that anyone could sign up to but the reality is not so simple .
",
14191,0,," the right may defend corporate greed and the left government intervention but there is a clearer principle ; i have the right not to have my air poisoned by your chemical company which means i do n't have to pay for any government body to clear up the mess .
",
14192,0,," the oglala sioux activist and actor , russell means has argued that `` a libertarian society would not allow anyone to injure others by pollution because it insists on individual responsibility . ''
",
14193,0,," all too often the line between consumer and citizen is blurred because the interest of both state and private actors have become conjoined leaving little or no room for the individual between them .
",
14194,0,," a libertarian approach would break that cozy consensus .
",
14195,0,," a libertarian agenda is one that draws people from across the political spectrum .
",
14196,0,," the crisis in the financial sector has confirmed for many that government and large financial institutions have simply got too close .
",
14197,0,," republicans say they can reduce the size of government but never do , democrats say they can regulate corporations but show no sign of doing so .
",
14198,0,," one of principal reasons for the growth of libertarian parties , especially in the west , is the dominance of one particular ideological viewpoint that is broadly shared by all the major parties .
",
14199,0,," as a result anyone who does not share this viewpoint are effectively disenfranchised and have the world view of a de facto governing class imposed upon them .
",
14200,0,," the only sensible response is to reduce the impact of that government altogether .
",
14201,0,," indeed in the united states , where the libertarian argument has been made most vociferously , the entire political system is designed on the predicate of a minimalist state and is poorly designed to deal with the behemoth that the federal government has become .
",
14202,1,,"modern day society relies more and more on electronic forms of communication for ease, speed and accessibility.
",
14203,1,," a huge majority of citizens in developed countries have easy access to the internet, and internet access in developing countries is becoming more and more common.
",
14204,1,," mobile phones provide another opportunity for developing countries; for example, in kenya, the mobile baking company m-pesa has now provided a farmer in the rift valley the same banking opportunities as somebody living in a major city.
",
14205,1,," thousands of people who become new mobile phone subscribers live in emerging markets, and electronics have demonstrated an extraordinary power to connect communities.
",
14206,1,," however, while banking and instant messaging have already taken off, simple actions such as voting in a local or general election must be done by traveling to a polling station and physically checking off a piece of paper.
",
14207,1,," in both developed and developing countries, this can be a problem for those who live far away from a polling station.
",
14208,1,," many people are beginning to ask whether this should change to online voting.
",
14209,1,,"electronic voting brings with it many complex issues.
",
14210,1,," electronic voting machines which have been trialed in the usa are still criticised, and their effectiveness and integrity have been questioned.
",
14211,1,," some american states now demand that electronic voting systems must produce a paper record which can be checked manually if there are any doubts about the results.
",
14212,1,," this was a particularly prominent issue in theus presidential election, where it is suspected that thousands of votes were actually lost by the machines.
",
14213,1,," however, even in states where these terminals are used, they are still located at the polling station rather than allowing people to send in votes from their own homes.
",
14214,1,,"this is concerned with the prospect of voting over the internet or via mobile phones, which is known as remote electronic voting (rev).
",
14215,1,," while no country has yet adopted rev as the main voting method, the uk conducted trials in 2003, and arizona introduced internet voting for overseas citizens.
",
14216,1,," despite this, there are still plenty of critics who stand against electronic voting and believe that it is an unreliable way of measuring votes.
",
14217,1,,"the proposition case must consider whether they intend to make all voting electronic, or whether only in certain cases.
",
14218,1,," if all voting was electronic, then the current norm of local polling stations would be unnecessary, which would save a huge amount of time and money.
",
14219,1,," external voting alone costs many european countries millions of euros for a relatively small proportion of the population.
",
14220,1,," however, performing all voting electronically raises questions about those who do not have home access to internet, and perhaps more importantly how the entirety of the vote could be completely accurate given problems experienced with this form of voting in the past.
",
14221,1,," it is easier to defend a case which argues that internet and electronic voting is one option which should be enacted alongside traditional polling methods to benefit those who cannot or do not, for whatever reason, get to the polling stations to vote.
",
14222,1,," if proposition chooses to use a mechanism which states that all voting must be done electronically, they take on an (unnecessary) burden to show that the software used is completely secure and cannot be infiltrated or suffer from technical complications which could compromise the elections, for example by losing votes.
",
14223,1,," this is very difficult to prove as many experts believe that there is no computer (especially in a ‘distributed system’, or network of computers) which is completely and utterly impenetrable.
",
14224,1,," given that a large part of the proposition case is extolling the virtues of voters having personal, home access to the internet and electronics, it would be impossible to avoid the networking connections between computers when conducting an election in this way.
",
14225,1,," therefore, it is more difficult to defend a case which states that all voting should be done electronically than defending a case which allows multiple forms of voting, of which electronic or internet voting is one.
",
14226,0,," in many western democracies , voter turnout has been falling while voter apathy appears to be rising .
",
14227,0,," in the uk , voter turnout fell sharply between 1997-2000 , and the last general election insaw only% of potential voters cast a vote .
",
14228,0,," in the usa , the federal election ofsaw only 37.8 % of potential voters cast their vote .
",
14229,0,," voter turnouts across europe follow this trend .
",
14230,0,," when so few people participate in the key act of democracy -- voting for the political leader of the country -- it begins to raise worrying questions about the legitimacy of that democracy in the first place .
",
14231,0,," if electronic or internet voting was introduced as an option alongside more traditional polling methods , it would expands the accessibility of the voting system in general .
",
14232,0,," internet or electronic voting would be a strategic practical measure .
",
14233,0,," it would make voting convenient for busy modern citizens because it minimalises the amount of effort each individual has to contribute -- namely , they do not have to travel to the polling stations .
",
14234,0,," as such , it removes physical restrictions on the voting process and becomes more universally accessible .
",
14235,0,," this would prevent people from being unable to vote because they are ` too busy ' -- whether this is simply because their local polling station is too far away for them to commute to , or to fit in alongside their other daily responsibilities based at work or home .
",
14236,0,," in modern , developed countries , many people spend both work and leisure time on the internet or using electronic devices .
",
14237,0,," our traditional voting systems , with polling stations and paper slips , is out of line with how many of the population now live their lives .
",
14238,0,," when we see an overwhelming number of people -- especially young people -- voting for reality television programmes such as the x factor , it demonstrates a valuable method of engagement which the political system is missing out on .
",
14239,0,," this had led to sources such as the bbc darkly questioning ` is big brother really more popular than election ? '
",
14240,0,," , indicating that while the overall number of votes in thegeneral election in the uk outweighed those cast for big brother and fame academy , the proportion of votes by young voters , 18-34 , could be understood to show more engagement with these television shows than with the general election .
",
14241,0,," in any case , it is clear that we should bring our voting systems up to date in order to engage young people and the wider population .
",
14242,0,," because it would not require manual counting and tallying , remote electronic voting would allow the results to be known much faster , and would also eliminate the potential for human error , which is a common problem with the current system .
",
14243,0,," for example , in the wisconsin supreme court election of, a clerk discovered around 14,000 unrecorded votes which had been missed by human error -- and actually changed the outcome of the election .
",
14244,0,," the clerk is now being questioned regarding her party allegiances under suspicion that she was trying to turn the election into a victory for her favoured candidate -- yet another potential for abuse under the current system .
",
14245,0,," machines , of course , are impartial concerning party allegiances and so eliminate the potential for individual corruption .
",
14246,0,," electronic voting would also save a great deal of money which is currently spent on employing counters and renting venues to be used as polling stations .
",
14247,0,," for example the uk general election incost over #million to organise , canada 'selection cost around $million , and the usa presidential election ofwas estimated to cost up to $ 5.3 billion .
",
14248,0,," electronic voting also brings the opportunity to increase access to those who currently find it difficult to register their votes ; for example , electronic voting could be conducted in a minority language for those who find english difficult .
",
14249,0,," in the past , trials of this have been shown to improve voter turnout among minority groups .
",
14250,0,," electronic voting could also benefit the elderly , as many find it difficult to use the lever-operated ballots currently in use .
",
14251,0,," using electronic voting ensures that no groups are left out of an essentially democratic process .
",
14252,0,," our online security is improving every day ; people feel safe enough to trust their most important details , such as bank details , to the internet -- why not their vote ?
",
14253,0,," secure software and encryption protocols have allowed online markets to flourish , with companies such as paypal inspiring a sense of security among their customers .
",
14254,0,," any software for remote electronic voting could be scrutinised well in advance .
",
14255,0,," it also removes the potential for identity fraud , which is a problem with current postal voting systems .
",
14256,0,," each voter could be given a unique password , if necessary alongside something like a special swipe card , ensuring that everybody who is entitled to vote gets a single vote .
",
14257,0,," given that in many jurisdictions , traditional polling stations do not require voters to provide id , it would arguably be a security improvement on the current situation .
",
14258,1,,"the border between north and south korea is the most heavily fortified in the world.
",
14259,1,," officially, the korean war has never ended and the two countries have maintained merely a nervous coexistence since the end of formal hostilities in 1953.
",
14260,1,," both sides maintain enormous armies and have mandatory national service.
",
14261,1,," it is worth noting that the forms of national service differ enormously; althoughmonths for virtually all men in the south may seem long, it pales into insignificance with theyears in the north.
",
14262,1,," typically around the world where there is national servicemonths is standard increasing to two years in some countries.
",
14263,1,,"there has been a discernible generational shift in attitudes towards national service in recent years most obviously demonstrated by the efforts of celebrities and the sons of senior politicians and business leaders to avoid the draft.
",
14264,1,," the lengths to which some will go are extraordinary, for example shin dong-hyun, a hip-hop artist better known as mc dong pulled out his own, healthy, teeth in an effort to fail the physical exam.
",
14265,1,," more common methods are either the mundane such as drinking too much coffee to increase blood pressure before the medical or the rather more extreme such as changing nationality as was the case with singer yoo seung-jun.
",
14266,1,," yoo had emigrated to the us as a child with his family but repeatedly said that he would complete his national service.
",
14267,1,," just before he was due to be conscripted in 2002, however, he adopted naturalised american citizenship, making him exempt.
",
14268,1,," the public outcry was huge and led the government to ban him from performing on the peninsula.
",
14269,1,,"opinion is divided on the matter with many accepting that celebrities need to be in the public eye constantly otherwise they quickly fade from public memory and that they probably have only until they are about thirty, the cut off point for performing national service, before their career is over.
",
14270,1,," others take the attitude that celebrities are simply trying to use their status to avoid doing something that nobody else really wants to do either.
",
14271,1,,"some celebrities such as the singer rain have made a point of performing their duty and it makes for a major news story when they enrol and start basic training.
",
14272,1,," in rain’s case one british newspaper went so far as to describe him as “south korea’s modern-day elvis” in reference to elvis presley’s being drafted in 1957.
",
14273,1,,"the fact that sportsmen, like entertainers, face particular challenges in taking a two year break from their careers at an age when they are at the height of their powers is recognised by the south korean government.
",
14274,1,," athletes who win an olympic gold, or a similar achievement, are given an exemption from service.
",
14275,1,," no such provision applies for entertainers.
",
14276,1,," although there was international coverage of rain’s entering the army, it will be interesting to see whether the hundreds of fans who turned up to bid farewell to the k-pop idol on his first day in uniform will be back at the barracks gates when he completes his service in two years’ time.
",
14277,0,," the south korean government issues occasional exemptions to athletes who have won an olympic gold medal or achieved a similar feat .
",
14278,0,," if we accept that the law ought to be consistent then there is no reason why entertainers should not be proffered the same opportunity .
",
14279,0,," both professions tend to favour the young and the requirement that military service needs to be completed before the age of thirty mean that either career would be interrupted just at the point when the individual is likely to be at the height of their skills .
",
14280,0,," equally both groups bring prestige for korea as a nation .
",
14281,0,," entertainers like jung-ji hoon , rain , have just as much of a following as athletes such as park ji-sung who , along with his team mates on the korean national team was exempted from military service for reaching the semi-finals of the world cup .
",
14282,0,," indeed rain predominantly works in korea and has a following throughout the country and the region whereas park has spent most of his career playing for foreign teams .
",
14283,0,," the career path of celebrities is unusual in that it accretes over time on the basis of the performers standing in the public mind .
",
14284,0,," unlike other professions this does not lend itself to taking two years out of the limelight , especially years when fame is coming to its height .
",
14285,0,," the media is notoriously fickle and equally well-known for having a short memory .
",
14286,0,," it generally struggles to stay interested in a celebrity if they 're out of the limelight for more than a few weeks .
",
14287,0,," it is simply unfeasible that they would remain interested when someone has been out of the spotlight for over two years .
",
14288,0,," in effect this means that for a korean musician or actor their career will finish at the age of.
",
14289,0,," in other profession it is possible to build a career around national service and employers know that at some point any young man they employ will need to undertake their military service but celebrities simply are n't employed in this way .
",
14290,0,," for most professions , getting military service out of the way early in one 's career makes sense .
",
14291,0,," nobody would suggest that members of other professions should be expected to interrupt it when they are at the height of their profession .
",
14292,0,," in reality for most people this would be when they are in their fifties .
",
14293,0,," for professions like acting and music this tends to be the late twenties and early thirties .
",
14294,0,," indeed , for pop singers in particular their career is likely to be over when they are.
",
14295,0,," in the light of this setting the age limit where it is is uniquely unfair to performers -- just as it is to athletes .
",
14296,0,," military service anywhere in the world is considered to be something you undertake before your career , not in the middle of it .
",
14297,0,," regulations should reflect reality , in this instance that means allowing performers to get on with their careers .
",
14298,1,,"affirmative action (or positive discrimination) is the use of different standards for assessing different groups of people, so as to help a group that has historically been at a disadvantage.
",
14299,1,," in an education context, the relevant type of affirmative action is that used for admission to universities.
",
14300,1,," in particular, universities may wish to use affirmative action to raise the presence of poor students or students from ethnic minorities.
",
14301,1,," there are several affirmative action policies which occur around the world from new zealand where the maori minority is favoured to south africa where the legacy of apartheid aims to be corrected to the united states where black and hispanic students may be given preferential treatment in admission procedures.
",
14302,1,," such discrimination is a controversial issue, notably in the united states, where asupreme court decision ruled that universities are allowed to use the practice.
",
14303,1,," debates may either be about permitting universities to use positive discrimination (where it is currently illegal), or about the state requiring them to do so.
",
14304,1,," the mechanism could be one of two types: either using quotas to determine the outcome of the admissions process (e.g. requiring universities to admit a certain percentage of students from minority groups, deprived areas, or non-private schools), or by using different admissions criteria that take race, poverty or school-background into account.
",
14305,0,," affirmative action is required for equality of opportunity .
",
14306,0,," under the status quo , it is easier for students who go to better schools to get into university .
",
14307,0,," this is reflected in data from the uk - oxford and cambridge universities , the top academic institutions , take more than% of their students from private schools , despite% of uk schoolchildren state educated .
",
14308,0,," in addition , there is a clear underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in these universities .
",
14309,0,," a similar story is evident with regards to ethnic minorities in the usa - white students are more likely to graduate from high school and go to college than black and hispanic ones .
",
14310,0,," these examples reflect the opportunities granted to wealthier children from particular socioeconomic and racial groups , whose superior education and less disruptive home lives give them a leg-up .
",
14311,0,," it is unfair that such random aspects , which have nothing to do with talent or hard work , have such a determining influence on one 's life chances .
",
14312,0,," moreover , it undermines meritocracy -- by allowing the rich to be advantaged , we create a society in which wealth , rather than ability , is rewarded .
",
14313,0,," affirmative action is required to overcome existing prejudice in universities ' admissions procedures .
",
14314,0,," there is clear prejudice in the job market , as shown in a study by marianne bertrand , an associate professor at the university of chicago graduate school of business , and sendhil mullainathan of massachusetts institute of technology .
",
14315,0,," following this line of thinking , it is therefore not a far-fetched idea that admissions departments in top universities are likely to be discriminating against applicants from minority backgrounds , even if this process is not deliberate .
",
14316,0,," a senior academic will look to see in applicants qualities they see in themselves , so , given the overwhelmingly white , affluent , male makeup of the academic community , minorities are at a disadvantage even if the admissions officer is not intending to discriminate against them .
",
14317,0,," prejudice towards certain types of applicants is blatantly unfair , and also undermines meritocracy , as explained above .
",
14318,0,," since we do not expect applicants from minority backgrounds to actually be worse applicants , it makes sense to require universities to take more of them , so as to protect the system from any bias that may exist .
",
14319,0,," affirmative action is required to change negative perceptions of university life .
",
14320,0,," in the status quo , many talented potential students are put off applying for top universities , or university at all , because of their negative perceptions of elite institutions .
",
14321,0,," this perception exists in part because of the makeup of the student population -- black high school students may see a university filled overwhelmingly with white lecturers and students as not being a welcoming environment for them , and may even perceive it as racist .
",
14322,0,," the only way to overcome this unfortunate stereotype of university is to change the student population , but this is impossible to do ` organically ' while so few people from minority backgrounds apply .
",
14323,0,," therefore , it is necessary to use quotas and other forms of affirmative action , to change the student body in the short term , and encourage applications from more disadvantaged students in the long term .
",
14324,0,," college admission processes are impersonal and favourably biased towards white , affluent students -- therefore , quotas specifically for minority students need to be established .
",
14325,0,," college admissions processes are as such because they heavily rely on standard tests or college admission exams .
",
14326,0,," this has caused countries such as brazil to create quotas for brown , mixed , and black students in most universities .
",
14327,0,," these students can not afford the better education enjoyed by their rich , white counterparts , and therefore do not perform well in college exams and do not gain admission into university .
",
14328,0,," quotas are needed to make the admission process a little bit fairer and increase the number of minorities in university campuses .
",
14329,1,,"intelligence services provide the government with essential information to make decisions in regards to threats to national security.
",
14330,1,," there are three sources of threats to national security and therefore three ‘target areas’ for intelligence: domestic, foreign and military.
",
14331,1,," in many countries (but not all), each target area has its own specific agency: for example, the uk has mi5 for domestic intelligence, sis (also known as mi6) for foreign intelligence and dis (defence intelligence staff) for military intelligence.
",
14332,1,," the intelligence services usually perform the following four types of activities: intelligence gathering, analysis, counter-intelligence and covert action.
",
14333,1,,"there are several methods of intelligence gathering, including ‘using personal contact’ such as paid informants, planting agents within organisations, etc. (called humint, human intelligence), inferring information from electronic signals (called sigint, signals intelligence) and more.
",
14334,1,," counterintelligence refers to the activities employed by intelligence agencies/governments to prevent other countries/actors from successfully gathering intelligence against them.
",
14335,1,," covert action is when an intelligence agency engages in clandestine operations against a target.
",
14336,1,,"to protect national security, intelligence agencies are given broad and exceptional powers.
",
14337,1,," exercising these powers can clash with citizens’ basic rights.
",
14338,1,," in this casefile, i will explore this tension between national security and basic rights by focussing on the case for domestic intelligence in a democracy.
",
14339,1,," the case for military and foreign intelligence in a democracy is more straightforward and more easily justified, but many of the arguments against domestic intelligence agencies could also apply against foreign and military intelligence.
",
14340,0,," does domestic intelligence have a place in a functioning democracy and is it an infringement on this democracy?
",
14341,0,,"domestic intelligence is very important to the national security and to the safety of the public .
",
14342,0,," domestic intelligence is imperative in preventing terrorist attacks on the country when terrorists are as likely to be natives as foreigners , for example the 7/7 bombers in britain were all native .
",
14343,0,," in order for a domestic intelligence organization to be effective , its organizational discretion must be limited by establishing clear legislation that is not secret , on the focus , limits , and techniques of domestic intelligence .
",
14344,0,," when this is in place domestic intelligence is not harmful , nor infringement on democracy -- it is in the people 's best interest .
",
14345,0,," as professor dahl notes `` intelligence is about the thousands and thousands of routine , everyday observations and activities ... in many cases these observations , this intelligence , is about routine activities undertaken by ordinary americans and others who do not intend to cause harm . ''
",
14346,0,," this intrusion is necessary in order to catch the few who do intend to do harm .
",
14347,0,," domestic intelligence does require the collection of information , but this is not fundamentally different from a standard police investigation .
",
14348,0,," the differences are minor when we have national security at stake .
",
14349,0,," furthermore , the rights , duties and powers of a domestic intelligence service are carefully restricted by law .
",
14350,0,," for example , under dutch law , the general intelligence and security service , aivd , is only allowed to wiretap someone after permission granted by the minister of interior affairs , the uk situation is very similar .
",
14351,0,," generally speaking , for every surveillance action the domestic intelligence can take , it needs to weigh whether the action satisfies the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity , meaning that the invasiveness of a surveillance method should be proportional to the risk the person poses , and that the method chosen should be the least invasive of all possible methods .
",
14352,0,," even if not every citizen can control exactly what the intelligence service does , there is sufficient political and judicial control .
",
14353,0,," an example of this is a recent case involving the dutch aivd , which started wiretapping journalists after they had found a source within the aivd to leak about the run-up to the iraq war .
",
14354,0,," the journalists were wiretapped but when the case came to court , the court judged that the aivd was in error , should stop harassing the journalists , and must delete the files on the journalists immediately .
",
14355,0,," such cases show that the intelligence agencies , and those involved domestically in particular , have judicial and political oversight to make sure they remain within bounds .
",
14356,0,," democracy is therefore not threatened as there is democratic oversight .
",
14357,0,," domestic intelligence services are the only organization that is capable of performing counterintelligence .
",
14358,0,," they have the capacity and the authority to detect foreign spies in the national jurisdiction , and experience with local surveillance and investigation .
",
14359,0,," part of the job of domestic intelligence is to maintain a network of informers and agents , and this can be used to find and track foreign intelligence services on a mission -- these functions ca n't be easily performed by the military or foreign intelligence so an independent domestic intelligence agency is necessary .
",
14360,1,,"the internet has become a major centre of extremist activity, one so important that osama bin ladin back insaid that 90% of all jihadist activity will soon be through the media, which in turn is increasingly being dominated, at least from a jihadi point of view by the internet.
",
14361,1,," often spread out geographically, communication online has become the primary tool for their discussion and organization.
",
14362,1,," not only cat-lovers but also radical islamist movements have capitalised on the potential of the internet.
",
14363,1,," using websites to spread their message, they have increased their reach in the 21st century, spreading its radical messages and gaining recruits in the west.
",
14364,1,,"this growth has sparked serious debate about the role of internet intermediaries (isps like aol or bt but also osps like facebook, google and twitter) in the combatting of extremist, dangerous groups using the web as a platform.
",
14365,1,," some groups suggest that it is should fall to the individual intermediaries to self-police and to block sites that promote various brands of extremism.
",
14366,1,," others question whether this action will adulterate free access to the internet more generally, or if this duty should fall to private agents and not the state.
",
14367,1,,"it is necessary to make something clear in this debate that the arguments stand in most legal contexts.
",
14368,1,," with some tweaks one might use these arguments to discuss a mandate from the state to require that isps block these sites, or to discuss the arguments in the context of a regime in which isps have freedom to allow or disallow these sites.
",
14369,1,," the various arguments have different weight and different emphasis given the paradigm considered.
",
14370,1,," the arguments presented in this debate seek to be open enough to be utilized in varying contexts.
",
14371,1,,"for the purpose of this debate, “extremist” can be taken broadly to mean any group that promotes popular revolution or violent action against the state, individual human beings or groups within society.
",
14372,1,," this definition is quite broad, and the arguments put forward in the following debate can be used quite effectively even if the definition is broadened or narrowed to a degree.
",
14373,0,," freedom of speech certainly may be curtailed when real harms can be shown to arise from it .
",
14374,0,," extremist sites serve as centers of dangerous dissent , whose members threaten all of society .
",
14375,0,," they promote a message that is fundamentally bad speech , because it can not it can not be argued with and promotes aims that are so anathema to free society that its dissemination represents a true threat to people 's safety .
",
14376,0,," the threat extremists represent to free society demands that their right to speech online be curtailed .
",
14377,0,," by blocking these sites , isps certainly are denying some freedom of speech , but it is a necessarily harmful form of speech that has no value in the global commons .
",
14378,0,," thus , there is essentially no real loss of valuable speech in censoring extremist websites .
",
14379,0,," isps are ultimately private providers of a service .
",
14380,0,," because of this they should retain the right to restrict that service to certain groups .
",
14381,0,," so long as isps make public their policy for what constitutes extremism so that consumers can decide if they want to opt into it , there is no real issue .
",
14382,0,," there are many filters available to users to screen out certain materials already , for example internet providers offer customers the option to block adult content , and this is merely an extension of this approach .
",
14383,0,," businesses must be able to sort their own ethos .
",
14384,0,," some isps may not opt to use this power given to them by the state , but others may not wish to carry content they consider dangerous .
",
14385,0,," because extremism is on the very fringe of speech and opinion , and because of the potential dangers that can arise from it , it is only right that the state give some ability to isps to block objectionable content .
",
14386,0,," the isps are the gatekeepers of information .
",
14387,0,," when the internet places no moral judgments on content and the isps let all information through without commentary , it lends an air of permissiveness to the beliefs put forward , that they are held by reasonable people .
",
14388,0,," the internet is a great tool for education , but also one that can be used to sow misinformation and extreme rhetoric .
",
14389,0,," extremist groups have been able to use the internet to a remarkable extent in promoting their beliefs and recruiting new members .
",
14390,0,," worse still , the administrators of these extremist sites are able to choke of things like dissenting commenters , giving the illusion that their view is difficult , or even impossible to reasonably challenge .
",
14391,0,," in doing so they create an echo chamber for their ideas that allows them to spread and to affect people , particularly young people susceptible to such manipulation .
",
14392,0,," the best example of this activity is in the international jihadist community and its reaching out to people in the west .
",
14393,0,," young disaffected muslims have received an introduction to militant islamism from sites often based abroad , but also some domestically , increasing the number of believers in an extreme , militant form of that religion .
",
14394,0,," by denying these people a platform on the internet , isps are able to not only make a moral stance that is unequivocal , but also to choke off access to new members who can be saved by never seeing the negative messages .
",
14395,0,," the greatest fear people have about extremist groups is not their rhetoric , but the actions the rhetoric precipitates .
",
14396,0,," extremists have proven adept at setting up basic websites through which to build communities to organize and coordinate extreme actions .
",
14397,0,," this means in the most limited form the coordinating of extremist demonstrations and rallies , but also violent and terrorist actions .
",
14398,0,," the best example of this is as-sahab , al-qaeda 's media arm , which has used an extensive web presence to galvanize supporters and to coordinate terrorist attacks .
",
14399,0,," in using the tools of the mass media extremists have succeeded in bringing supporters to their cause , people who are often geographically diffuse , into a close community capable of action and disruption that harms all citizens .
",
14400,0,," if blocking these websites entirely isps would pose a significant barrier to these extremist groups organising .
",
14401,0,," even more damaging to these networks in the long terms would be the drop in recruitment due to a reduction in their reach .
",
14402,0,," isps can significantly hamper these organizations from ever embarking on serious violent actions , and from coalescing in the first place by denying them their most effective springboard .
",
14403,0,," the most important effect is in the prevention of radicalization in the first place .
",
14404,0,," preventing , or at least hampering access to extremist materials serves to keep impressionable , swayable people from experiences that might turn them to extremism .
",
14405,0,," as the access providers for the internet isps are best placed to implement policies for blocking extremist sites and so are the natural option for deciding when and which sites to block .
",
14406,0,," furthermore , because the state is often slow due its extensive bureaucracy , it is less able to respond with alacrity to extremist sites popping up online .
",
14407,0,," isps on the other hand are likely to be able to act as soon as they are informed of the existence of a website whereas working through government would simply add an extra layer of requests and orders .
",
14408,0,," the isps blocking the site also creates a fire break between the state and the action so not giving the extremists the ammunition that state intervention might give them .
",
14409,0,," essentially , the good result of eliminating these sites from public access is accomplished faster , more effectively , and with lesser backlash than if any other agent did the blocking .
",
14410,1,,"golden dawn is a right-wing extremist political party that has rapidly gained prominence in the midst of the economic depression greece finds itself in.
",
14411,1,," having been founded inby nikolaos michaloliakos, golden dawn’s recent success in the juneelections gained them 7% of the national vote translating intoseats in the greek parliament.
",
14412,1,,"[1] the elections resulted in a coalition government headed by antonis samaras which includes the parties new democracy, pasok and democratic left.
",
14413,1,," golden dawn’s success has come in the wake of austerity-induced economic depression with unemployment soaring to over 20% and youth unemployment to 36%.
",
14414,1,," aside from its economic woes, greece also faces problems of a huge influx of illegal immigrants and political refugees / asylum seekers and currently has the largest number of illegal immigrants percitizens, in europe.
",
14415,1,," [2]golden dawn hold hard-line right-wing political views and call for a strong state seeking to safeguard core traditional greek values and culture.
",
14416,1,," [3] as such, they have a strong anti-immigration and white supremacist agenda.
",
14417,1,," although golden dawn themselves deny it, the party is generally seen as neo-nazi in character having commonly been reported to use original german nazi slogans translated into greek and nazi-like salutes.
",
14418,1,," [4] golden dawn supporters have widely been reported to have carried out racist acts of violence across greece, primarily targeting illegal immigrants.
",
14419,1,," the party’s voter base is largely consistent of ‘small proprietors, unemployed, members of the security forces, plus the criminal underworld’.
",
14420,1,," [5] as golden dawn’s popularity seems to be on the rise, with the party ranking third in recent opinion polls with 10.5% [6] and racist acts of violence are on the increase, this debate looks at fundamental questions about the role of the state in balancing democratic liberties, rights of political participation and freedom of speech, with the rights of minority groups to live safe from fear, violence and racial hatred.
",
14421,0,,"[5] ibidgolden dawn 's heavily racist agenda has led to a huge increase in the amount of violent crimes committed against immigrants and refugees , many of whom from conflict torn areas like afghanistan , syria and iraq .
",
14422,0,," gangs of golden dawn members , usually clad in golden dawn black t-shirts and balaclavas to hide their identity have been widely reported to attack immigrants , many of whom are homeless , at random , causing severe and often life threatening injuries upon their victims .
",
14423,0,,"  in the six months to septemberthere have beensuch attacks .
",
14424,0,,"  the situation has escalated to the extent that the united nations high commissioner for human rights navi pillay has expressed explicit concerns about human rights violations committed in greece .
",
14425,0,,"  this behaviour is totally unacceptable from any individual or organisation and especially for a political party .
",
14426,0,," through their hateful messages and nazi inspired ideology and chants like `` blood , honour , golden dawn ''  , golden dawn are directly inciting hatred and violence amongst their supporters .
",
14427,0,," not only this , but their own party members , wearing party uniform and representing golden dawn are the ones often causing such violence .
",
14428,0,," the state has an imperative to protect society from such heinous acts .
",
14429,0,," it is unacceptable to have people living in fear of their own lives , whether they are greek citizens or not and irrespective of whether they are legal or illegal immigrants .
",
14430,0,," all people have a basic human right to be able to live free of fear from racial persecution , and the greek state is failing to safeguard those rights within its own borders .
",
14431,0,," fear of marginalisation and persecution are the worst kind of oppression because it attacks their very identity and prevents them from feeling and living as free members of society .
",
14432,0,," golden dawn , their beliefs and their actions must be categorically condemned , and there is no better way to do it than by banning them as a political party .
",
14433,0,," they must be expelled immediately from parliament and elections must be held again , from which golden dawn will be banned from entering .
",
14434,0,," in ideological terms , golden dawn call for systemic change on a huge scale , claiming the current structure of the greek political system is riddled with traitors and foreign interests .
",
14435,0,,"  history , for example right wing regimes all over europe in the 1930s , has shown us that when right-wing extremists have gained a foothold in government , they have tried their utmost to destroy the very system from within and wipe out democracy .
",
14436,0,," given golden dawn 's claims for the need to purge the country of traitors , it is not at all unthinkable that greece could go down a similar root should the party see its popularity increase even more .
",
14437,0,," although it is true that people should be allowed to elect any government they want , a democracy can not be allowed to self-destruct .
",
14438,0,," this is a choice the electorate can not be allowed to make for two reasons .
",
14439,0,," firstly , because a choice to live under a totalitarian regime is an irrevocable choice : there is no mechanism , other than violent revolution , to oust such a regime if things do not turn out as the electorate originally expected .
",
14440,0,," secondly , even if the voters are content with their decision , they can not be permitted to make such a decision on behalf of future generations who have not had a chance to vote yet .
",
14441,0,," future would-be electorates would be unable to oust a totalitarian regime they did not choose for themselves .
",
14442,0,," peoples ' right to exercise their basic democratic right must be protected , and in order to protect it , we must to an extent limit that very same right and deny them the possibility of voting for golden dawn .
",
14443,0,," golden dawn does not behave as most political parties and their mps do not behave like politicians .
",
14444,0,," this is because they are not what we would describe as politicians : they are thugs .
",
14445,0,," emboldened by their mp 's privilege of immunity from prosecution golden dawn mp 's have on multiple occasions been involved in public acts of violence .
",
14446,0,," mp dimitris koukoutsis is being investigated for an assault in parliament on syriza , leftist , mp vasiliki katrivanou  , while party spokesman ilias kasidiaris assaulted two other mp 's on a chat show broadcasted live on tv  .
",
14447,0,," worse still , many of golden dawn 's mp 's and members face criminal charges , including ilias kasidiaris who is accused of ` accessory to robbery , bodily harm and illegal gun possession '  , although his trial has been postponed on multiple occasions because of his mp 's privileges .
",
14448,0,," not only does golden dawn dislike democratic values , they actively abuse their mp 's privileges and behave unacceptably in a highly public manner towards fellow members of parliament .
",
14449,0,," party leader and mp nikos mihaloliakos has publicly declared that golden dawn feel uncomfortable and disgusted in parliament and called upon party members to rally behind them and violently take the struggle out of parliament and onto the streets of athens .
",
14450,0,,"  we can not allow such open criminality and violence to exist in politics and inside the greek parliament .
",
14451,0,," they totally lack respect for other politicians and do not participate in an orderly manner expected of members of parliament and many of them have committed acts of criminality before even being elected into parliament .
",
14452,0,," these people are not fit to take part in government and provide a horrific example for society .
",
14453,0,," they make a mockery of the political system and disgrace greek politics and greece as a whole .
",
14454,0,," they must be banned .
",
14455,0,,"  ibid by allowing golden dawn into parliament , golden dawn gain legitimacy in two ways .
",
14456,0,," firstly their very presence in parliament lends an air of legitimacy to their cause .
",
14457,0,," we have established that golden dawn 's message is harmful both to democracy and to minority group rights .
",
14458,0,," they have managed to use their newfound media exposure and greater state funding for their public relations department , to great effect .
",
14459,0,,"  however , even though there has been a social and media response against golden dawn and racist acts of violence , increased publicity , both positive and negative , is having the effect of normalising society 's view of the party .
",
14460,0,," as the political presence of golden dawn settles into society 's conscience , members and mp 's are often portrayed as normal people and the acts of violence committed under their name are ignored  .
",
14461,0,," the normalisation of golden dawn 's presence in democratic political discourse increases the likelihood that people will see their claims and methods as legitimate .
",
14462,0,," as the electorate despairs and becomes increasingly disillusioned with the mainstream parties of pasok and new democracy , the danger is that golden dawn 's increasingly normalised presence will soak up many votes from people who are not necessarily racist or strongly right-wing .
",
14463,0,," their provision of food-aid to unemployed and desperate greeks hit hard by the economic crisis has gained them further publicity and popularity in a similar way to extremist parties in the middle east -- even if it is very small they are seen to be doing something so rewarded for it .
",
14464,0,," an end must be put to golden dawn 's surge in popularity .
",
14465,0,," golden dawn must be seen for who they are and the only way to achieve this is by banning them .
",
14466,0,," once removed from the public eye and the media ceases to portray them as a legitimate party , golden dawn will no longer be able to attract support in the ways we have seen .
",
14467,1,,"the north atlantic treaty organisation was founded inas a political and military alliance binding western european democracies such as britain and france together with the usa and canada.
",
14468,1,," it was intended to defend europe against soviet communism, which in response built the warsaw pact as its own alliance bloc in eastern and central europe.
",
14469,1,," the basis of nato is that an attack on any of its members will be taken as an attack upon all of them, and that the whole military might of the alliance will be mobilised in response.
",
14470,1,," because of the deep seriousness of this guarantee, new members can only join nato if they are prepared to fully commit to collective security, and if all the existing member states vote to extend the guarantee to them.
",
14471,1,,"by the collapse of communism in the late 1980s most of the western european democracies and turkey had joined nato, although some including ireland, switzerland, sweden and finland remain neutral to this day.
",
14472,1,," the end of the cold war brought the collapse of both the warsaw pact and of communism, and the future of nato in the absence of these former threats seemed uncertain.
",
14473,1,," the alliance continued, however, intervening in the balkans in the 1990s and undertaking a peacekeeping role in afghanistan following thecampaign against the taliban.
",
14474,1,," it also continued to expand, taking in newly democratic former warsaw pact members such as poland, hungary and romania.
",
14475,1,," this expansion led nato into friction with moscow, which resented its former client states becoming american allies, in spite of informal western promises to gorbachev not to expand nato to these states,  and hosting advanced weapons systems which it feared could be turned against russia.
",
14476,1,," most offensive to russia, however, was theentry into nato of latvia, lithuania and estonia, three baltic states which had once been part of the soviet union itself.
",
14477,1,," despite russian protests the baltic countries were accepted into nato and their forces integrated into its military structure.
",
14478,1,,"nato membership greatly appeals to the newly democratic states of central and eastern europe, who remain wary of russia and keen to associate themselves with western democracy and prosperity.
",
14479,1,," in most cases, nato membership has been followed by eu membership, although the two organisations are separate and do not fully overlap in membership.
",
14480,1,," the usa has also been an enthusiast for the expansion of nato, and has most recently championed the applications for membership of georgia and ukraine.
",
14481,1,," these two former states of the ussr both removed pro-russian regimes in theirrose revolution andorange revolution respectively, events which the kremlin saw as the result of western meddling.
",
14482,1,," since then politics in both states have been turbulent, with ukraine split between pro-nato and pro-moscow elements.
",
14483,1,," in most of georgia opinion is more united, but two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia have resisted rule from tbilisi and managed their own affairs under russian patronage.
",
14484,1,,"at its bucharest conference in the spring of 2008, the united states urged its allies to offer georgia and ukraine membership action plans (maps) but was unable to persuade all of its european partners to do so.
",
14485,1,," georgia and ukraine were, however, given assurances that they would one day be welcomed into nato; assurances which went down badly in moscow.
",
14486,1,," in augustevents came to a head when georgia took military action in south ossetia and russia quickly sent troops into the enclave.
",
14487,1,," the american-trained georgian army was rapidly routed and russia gained military control of both breakaway regions, and abkhazia and south ossetia declared their independence.
",
14488,1,," although few other states have recognised their independence, the episode raised fears of a new cold war and called into question the wisdom of offering georgia and ukraine nato membership.
",
14489,1,,"sincethere has been no progress in bringing georgia and ukraine into nato.
",
14490,1,," ukraine made a turn towards russia inwhen it elected president yanukovych leading the country to no longer pursue nato membership while in georgia too there have been attempts to reestablish friendships with russia.
",
14491,1,," however inyanukovych was ousted in a pro-western revolution.
",
14492,1,," russia occupied crimea in events that are superficially very similar to theevents in georgia.
",
14493,1,," such action show the threat that russia poses to ukraine and potentially reopens the question of whether ukraine should join nato.
",
14494,1,," an option that kiev may once more wish to explore now that it has a westward leaning government.
",
14495,0,," many people in both ukraine and georgia wish to join nato , and that is the best reason for welcoming them into the alliance .
",
14496,0,," nato is an alliance of democratic states and should respond positively to the request of a sovereign nation .
",
14497,0,," in georgia a non-binding referendum on whether to join nato showed% of voters in favor of joining .
",
14498,0,," polls show that some% of ukrainians insaid that would support ukraine 's membership in nato if a referendum on this issue were held .
",
14499,0,," both states are at risk of being pushed around by russia , partly because their desire to adopt `` western '' democratic values is at odds with the more autocratic values of russia 's leadership .
",
14500,0,," they also fear that russia has designs on their territory and sovereignty , knowing that many in the russian elite have never fully accepted the collapse of the old soviet union .
",
14501,0,," these fears have been realised with russian forces in south ossetia , abkhazia , and crimea .
",
14502,0,," joining nato offers georgia and ukraine the protection of a proven alliance and a clear route to european union membership that has already been travelled by other former soviet states .
",
14503,0,," ukraine and georgia as european states have a right to join nato if they would satisfy all criteria for nato membership .
",
14504,0,," expansion to include georgia and ukraine is in the interests of nato .
",
14505,0,," after more than a decade without a clear role , the alliance now once again stands for the principle of solidarity between western liberal democracies .
",
14506,0,," the hopes of the 1990s for a new world order in which a democratic and liberalising russia would see partnership with nato and other western clubs as strongly in its own interest died during the presidency of vladimir putin .
",
14507,0,," russia once again poses a threat to europe and needs to be contained or at least shown that nato has not forgotten about it .
",
14508,0,," this is shown by president putin 's continuing lashing out at foreign countries for funding ngos and plans to boost defense spending .
",
14509,0,," extending nato up to russia 's southern border will signal the west 's strength and determination and force russia to respect the alliance and its members .
",
14510,0,," there is a strong precedent for letting ukraine and georgia join nato .
",
14511,0,," latvia , lithuania and estonia are also former soviet states , and russia objected to their entry into nato quite as much as it objects today about its black sea neighbours .
",
14512,0,," yet russia was not allowed a veto over their futures , and it soon got over its annoyance , continuing to participate in joint forums with nato and to cooperate with the usa over afghanistan , north korea and nuclear non-proliferation .
",
14513,0,," so nato is already committed to the defence of states in russia 's near-abroad , and should not fear further expansion .
",
14514,1,,"government transparency, the idea that government should be open about what it is doing with its citizens, has been around since the enlightenment when parliaments began to be more powerful than kings.
",
14515,1,," we usually consider that governmental transparency is a part of good governance in a democracy.
",
14516,1,," this is in part because we consider information to be a public good.
",
14517,1,," every citizen should have the ability to find out what their government is doing on their behalf.
",
14518,1,," in theory this really should apply to everything the government does; from transparency in what the government does with rubbish, through how elections are fought and lobbying processes, right up to military.
",
14519,1,," clearly it would be unreasonable if national security were to be excluded where all the rest of government has to be more transparent.
",
14520,1,,"unfortunately there have always been snags when it comes to national security and transparency.
",
14521,1,," being transparent means letting everyone know about something, it is then clearly impossible to restrict knowledge simply to the citizens of one particular nation, so transparency means transparency with everyone else’s citizens too.
",
14522,1,," in areas like rubbish collection this does not matter, but in national security it does.
",
14523,1,," as a result the state often claims ‘national security’ as a reason for why something has to remain secret.
",
14524,1,," this means that while the rest of government has been opening up as a result of freedom of information laws these laws tend to exempt information that “is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security” or if disclosure would prejudice defence or “the capability, effectiveness or security of any relevant forces.”
",
14525,1,,"yet it is becoming more difficult to keep secrets, to the point that it has been suggested that there will be no more secrets withinyears.
",
14526,1,," the internet changes this relationship fundamentally.
",
14527,1,," it provides immense communication and data advantages that security services can take advantage of.
",
14528,1,," but at the same time it means that others are likely to be able to obtain information the government wants to keep secret.
",
14529,1,," not engaging in transparency might therefore simply limit access to those who don’t have the knowledge and capabilities to engage in the hacking necessary to gain access to it.
",
14530,1,," the internet has also changed the realm of whistleblowing.
",
14531,1,," wikileaks has shown that information that the government considered to be part of its security interest can, and will, be leaked and often much of what is being considered secret cannot be justified on national security grounds.
",
14532,1,,"this will not stop the state trying.
",
14533,1,," conflict in particular breeds secrecy and the latest conflict western democracies are involved in, the war on terrorism, is no different.
",
14534,1,," there being some kind of enemy is exactly what the government needs to justify secrecy.
",
14535,1,," the question then that this debate explores is how justified it is to not be transparent in the realm of security.
",
14536,0,," the most essential commodity within a state is trust .
",
14537,0,," trust is essential in all sorts of aspect of our lives ; we trust that the paper money we have is actually worth more than a scrap of paper , that doctors performing surgery know what they are doing , that we wo n't be attacked in the street , and that the government is looking after our interests .
",
14538,0,," in order to create that trust there needs to be transparency so that we know that our institutions are trustworthy .
",
14539,0,," it is the ability to check the facts and the accountability that comes with transparency that creates trust .
",
14540,0,," and this in turn is what makes them legitimate .
",
14541,0,," the need for trust applies just as much to security as any other walk of life .
",
14542,0,," citizens need to trust that the security services really are keeping them safe , are spending taxpayers ' money wisely , and are acting in a fashion that is a credit to the country .
",
14543,0,," unfortunately if there is not transparency there is no way of knowing if this is the case and so often the intelligence services have turned out to be an embarrassment .
",
14544,0,," as has been the case with the cia and it 's the use of torture following 9/11 , for which there are still calls for transparency on past actions .
",
14545,0,," the nation exits for its citizens ; it depends on their consent to maintain order and to raise finances .
",
14546,0,," the main purpose of the state is law and order , and national defence , both of which are covered by security .
",
14547,0,," as an area that is so central to the role of the government it is vital that the stakeholders in that government , its citizens , know what it is the state is doing in their name for their security .
",
14548,0,," the obama administration for example refuses to acknowledge that it is carrying out a campaign using drones while at the same time saying it is `` the only game in town in terms of confronting and trying to disrupt the al-qaeda leadership . ''
",
14549,0,," if the us government is bombing another country then the us people have a right to know with much less ambiguity what exactly is being done , who is being hit , when and where .
",
14550,0,," they also need to be informed of any possible consequences .
",
14551,0,," transparency is necessary in international relations .
",
14552,0,," states need to know what each other are doing to assess their actions .
",
14553,0,," without any transparency the hole is filled by suspicion and threat inflation that can easily lead to miscalculation and even war .
",
14554,0,," the cuban missile crisis is a clear example where a lack of transparency on either side about what they were willing to accept and what they were doing almost lead to nuclear war .
",
14555,0,," it is notable that one of the responses to prevent a similar crisis was to install a hotline between the white house and kremlin .
",
14556,0,," a very small , but vital , step in terms of openness .
",
14557,0,," today this is still a problem ; china currently worries about the us ` pivot ' towards asia complaining it `` has aroused a great deal of suspicion in china . ''
",
14558,0,," `` a huge deficit of strategic trust lies at the bottom of all problems between china and the united states . ''
",
14559,0,," the result would be an inevitable arms race and possible conflict .
",
14560,0,," transparency is fundamental in making sure that mistakes do n't happen , or when they do that they are found and corrected quickly with appropriate accountability .
",
14561,0,," this applies as much , if not more , to the security apparatus than other walks of life .
",
14562,0,," in security mistakes are much more likely to be a matter of life and death than in most other walks of life .
",
14563,0,," they are also likely to be costly ; something the military and national security apparatus is particularly known for .
",
14564,0,," an audit of the pentagon infound that the us department of defense wasted $billion over two years .
",
14565,0,," this kind of waste can only be corrected if it is found out about , and for that transparency is necessary .
",
14566,0,," transparency is necessary to avoid public relations disasters ; particularly in countries where the media has some freedom to investigate for themselves .
",
14567,0,," it is clearly the best policy for the military to make sure all the information is released along with the reasons behind actions rather than having the media finding individual pieces of a whole and speculating to fill the gaps .
",
14568,0,," a good example would be a collision on 16th januarybetween a b-52 bomber and a kc-135 tanker while attempting to refuel that destroyed both planes .
",
14569,0,," accidents happen , and this one costlives , but could have been much worse as the b-52 had four nuclear bombs on board were not armed and did not detonate .
",
14570,0,," in this case an initial lack of information rapidly turned into a public relations disaster that was stemmed by much more openness by the military and the us ambassador in spain .
",
14571,0,," the release of the information reduces the room for the press to fill in the gaps with harmful speculation .
",
14572,0,," in this case there was never much chance of national security implications or a break with spain as the country was ruled by the dictator franco , someone who would hardly pay attention to public opinion .
",
14573,0,," but in a democracy a slow and closed response could seriously damage relations .
",
14574,1,,"the catholic church forbids the use of barrier methods of contraception, such as condoms.
",
14575,1,," unlike other forms of contraception, barrier methods not only protect against unwanted pregnancy but also against sexually transmitted diseases, such as aids and hiv.
",
14576,1,," in many african and south american countries, aids and hiv are huge problems but people continue to have sex without condoms in order to follow the teachings of the catholic church.
",
14577,1,," in this debate, the proposition believe that the catholic church's position of forbidding barrier methods of contraception, such as condoms, is justified.
",
14578,1,,"edit it should be noted that this debate is partially out of date as there is no longer a complete ban: ‘there may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute [in this connection, the holy see press secretary specifically stated that the pope was not singling out “male” prostitutes; the same argument, he said, is valid also for female prostitutes] uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility, on the way toward recovering an awareness that not everything is allowed and that one cannot do whatever one wants.
",
14579,1,," but it is not really the way to deal with the evil of hiv infection.
",
14580,0,," that can really lie only in a humanization of sexuality’ (benedict xvi, 2010)catholics consider the first commandment given to them by god to be to ` multiply '.
",
14581,0,," in light of this , anything that limits procreation , be it the use of contraception or even condoning the use of contraception , is against god .
",
14582,0,," it is important to remember that the catholic church 's primary obligation is not to its people but to god .
",
14583,0,," the church is , therefore , justified in any action where the alternative is going against what they believe to be the wishes of god , even if it is harmful to the people of the church .

",
14587,1,," importantly, one of the lines of the pledge is “one nation under god.”
",
14588,1,," the words “under god” were not in the original pledge (1892) but were added inin reference to a speech by abraham lincoln.
",
14589,1,," in this debate, the proposition wish to have the words “under god” officially removed from the pledge altogether.
",

",
14591,0,,"the inclusion of the words `` under god '' in the pledge of allegiance is representative of religion 's involvement with the state .
",
14592,0,," the words under god in the pledge of allegiance were clearly government sanctioned as the words were added by congress with the sanction of president eisenhower .
",
14593,0,," , 83rd united states congress 2nd session , when they did this congress , the state , was clearly promoting religion .
",

",
14598,0,," , cornell university law school  the use of the words `` under god '' in this way , particularly regarding america 's history as a christian state , clearly shows favour towards christianity , or at its most expansive monotheistic religions , over alternative religions or no religion , even without explicitly mentioning christianity .
",
14599,0,," , newdow, even if the proposition accepts , which it does not , that the words `` under god '' do not show preference towards christianity , it is undeniable that it is widely understood that these words are a reference to christianity .
",
14600,0,," this associates national pride with christianity and presents other religions as inherently un-american .
",
14601,0,," the proposition believes that this is divisive and promotes religious intolerance and that , therefore , this legislation would help relieve the tolerance and divisions caused by the current pledge of allegiance .
",
14602,0,," the inclusion of the words `` under god '' in the pledge of allegiance implies that there is no place for atheism in american patriotism and that non-believers have nothing to give to their country .
",

",
14605,1,,"this is a debate about the christian church, and a proposition that utterly discounts the authority of the bible is rather missing the point.
",
14606,1,," there is a genuine debate within the church about whether gay men and women can be true representatives of god on earth.
",
14607,1,," generally, the attitude of church authorities is “don’t ask, don’t tell” or more firmly against gays and gay priests; a notable case in augustsaw the rev. robert nugent and sister jeannine gramick, who had ministered to gay and lesbian catholics for many years, summoned to the vatican and ordered to stop their work.
",
14608,1,," more recently, there have been controversies over the appointment in new hampshire of gene robinson as the anglican communion's first gay bishop, which threatened schism within the anglican communion, and over the attempted appointment of geoffrey john as a bishop in england, where john was first appointed bishop of reading and then forced by the archbishop of canterbury to stand down and has since been prevented from becoming bishop of southwark.
",
14609,1,," inthe church of scotland was also split over the appointment of an openly gay minister, scott rennie, in aberdeen where the church ultimately decided to lift its ban on gay priests.
",
14610,1,,"the church of england has however been changing its position since the rejection of geoffrey john in order not to be on the wrong side of the equality act 2010, in the churches legal advice it is conceded that ""a person's sexual orientation is in itself irrelevant to their suitability for episcopal office or indeed ordained ministry"" but appointment can be prevented if it would cause division.
",
14611,1,,"the proponents of gay rights inevitably face a tougher time inside the church, where they face a vociferous opposition, than in society as a whole where political correctness has made such outspoken criticism less common.
",
14612,1,,"with the recently announced proposal to legalise gay marriage in the uk and an ongoing review into the anglican church’s position on civil partnerships this is an issue is great contemporary significance.
",
14613,0,," homosexual behaviour occurs naturally -- both in humans and in the animal world , it has been observed in overanimal species of all different types from mammals to crabs to worms .
",
14614,0,," it must be a misunderstanding of god 's plan to say that homosexuality is unnatural -- it forms a part of the world that he has created and therefore must form part of his plan .
",
14615,0,," the substance of what the bible says about sexuality is that what matters is having a stable and loving relationship , not who that relationship is with .
",
14616,0,," sexuality is an indivisible part of personhood ; people need to be able to express their sexuality openly in order to fully actualise themselves .
",
14617,0,," it is wrong therefore to use sexuality as an individual metric by which they are eligible to become priests or not -- they should be taken on the whole of their personhood .
",
14618,0,," priests have a responsibility to represent the members of their congregations .
",
14619,0,," a large number of christians are gay , and they can receive better spiritual direction from gay ministers than from heterosexuals who do not understand their lifestyles or relationships as well .
",
14620,0,," the church has adapted over the centuries on a number of social and natural issues as it seeks to re-interpret and re-explain god 's message of love in the terms of modern society .
",
14621,0,," for example churches have adapted to the problems that science has thrown up , even the catholic church , often the slowest to embrace change did eventually agree with galileo over the earth going round the sun .
",
14622,0,," the acceptance of homosexuality and admission of gay priests is a necessary next step for the church today .
",
14623,0,," there will be others in the future .
",
14624,1,,"despite the increasingly tolerant attitude towards homosexuality in society, especially in the west, the treatment of homosexuals continues to differ from one country to another.
",
14625,1,," in some nations, homosexuality is illegal whilst in others, homosexuals are now accorded an increasing catalogue of rights that have been enjoyed by heterosexuals all along.
",
14626,1,," in the uk for instance, by virtue of a ruling of the european court of human rights in lustig-prean and beckett v uk (1999) gays can now serve in the armed forces.
",
14627,1,," despite these gains, in most countries gays have yet to attain complete equality of status in the eyes of the law, most notably the right to marry.
",
14628,1,," for many gay people, and for those who find gay rights troubling, the demand for a right to marry a person of the same gender has become the key modern political issue.
",
14629,1,," south africa, belgium, the netherlands, canada, argentina, portugal, sweden, iceland, norway and spain all allow gay marriage, while twenty-two other countries, including the uk, allow civil partnerships which give gay partners all the legal rights of marriage.
",
14630,1,," proponents argue that preventing gays from marrying is discriminatory and that it upholds a traditional, out-dated concept of marriage as the path to procreation.
",
14631,0,," opponents insist however that marriage is tied to the traditional and religious bonds which overtly suggest marriage is between a man and a woman.
",
14632,0,,"it is inaccurate to perceive marriage merely as an institution for child-raising purposes .
",
14633,0,," there are many married couples in society today who do not have children of their own , often by choice , and infertile couples , who can not conceive children , are still permitted to marry .
",
14634,0,," they marry because marriage symbolizes a long-term commitment to one another , not a pledge to reproduce for the state or humanity as a whole .
",
14635,0,," in any case , gay couples may adopt children in countries where they are permitted to do so , revealing society 's view at large that homosexual couples can readily act as capable parents and provide loving home environments .
",
14636,0,," furthermore , the advance of medical science has also enabled same-sex couples to have children of their own through surrogate mothers and sperm donors .
",
14637,0,," it can no longer be said that homosexual couples should not be granted the right to marriage because , either , they can not have children , or that they can not raise children adequately .
",
14638,0,," both claims are evidently false .
",
14639,0,," to allow gay couples to marry would enable them to take advantage of the various fiscal benefits accorded to married couples in general .
",
14640,0,," as scott bidstrup argues , a gay couple together foryears can still be compelled by law to testify or provide evidence against one another , something married spouses can not be forced to do.
",
14641,0,," such antiquated laws take the discriminatory view that the love between homosexuals is artificial and extend it to encompass legal benefits .
",
14642,0,," as justice anthony kennedy noted in a supreme court ruling , ` homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint '.
",
14643,0,," a gay couple 's inability to reproduce should not prevent them from obtaining the benefits of marriage , benefits granted not to encourage or reward child birth but to recognize the bond between two loved ones .
",
14644,0,," the state is charged with the responsibility of both providing registrars to conduct marriage ceremonies and authenticating marriages certificates .
",
14645,0,," if gay marriage was to be legalized , all registrars could be thereafter forced , by the state and their commitment to the law , to legally bind themselves to avoid discriminating between homosexual and heterosexual couples who ask for their service .
",
14646,0,," all registrars who refused to marry homosexual couples could be fired .
",
14647,0,," there could be no difference in the process or the paperwork required for either a heterosexual or homosexual marriage .
",
14648,0,," the dismissal of discriminating registrants would have a legal precedent in the charges brought upon hotel owners who refused gay couples and adoption agencies who refused to deal with gay couples .
",
14649,0,," gay marriage has clear and tangible positive effects on societies where it is permitted .
",
14650,0,," there are now ten countries that allow gay marriage , with no obvious or noticeable detriment to society at large .
",
14651,0,," as chris ott reports from massachusetts , one of few us states to grant gay marriage rights , ` predictably , the sky has n't fallen ... ensuring equality does n't mean there 's less to go around for everyone else '.
",
14652,0,," further to that , gay marriage encourages gay adoption , granting a home and a loving environment for an increasing number of orphaned or unwanted children worldwide .
",
14653,0,," the evidence also suggests that gay parenting is ` at least as favourable ' as those in heterosexual families , eroding fears that the adopted children will be worse with gay parents.
",
14654,0,," the economist thomas kostigen also argues gay marriage is a boost for the economy , ` weddings create revenue of all sorts ... even if a marriage does n't work out that helps the economy too .
",
14655,0,," divorces cost money '.
",
14656,0,," finally , and most simply , societies benefit from the net utility of their citizens , to allow and even encourage gay marriage ensures that those gay citizens wishing to celebrate their love are able to do so , in an environment conducive to their mutual happiness .

",
14661,0,," such discrimination should be eradicated by permitting gay couples to marry as a means of professing their love to each other .
",
14662,0,," the contemporary views of society ought to change with the times ; as recently as, blacks and whites in some americans could not marry , no-one would defend such a law now.
",
14663,0,," gay marriage is possibly , as theodore olson , a former bush administration republican suggests , ` the last major civil-rights milestone yet to be surpassed' .
",
14664,0,," to permit heterosexual couples to profess their love through the bonds of marriage , but deny that same right to homosexual couples ultimately devalues their love , a love that is no weaker or less valid than that of straight couples .
",
14665,0,," as new york state senator mark grisanti admitted when voting in favour of abill , ` i can not deny a person ... the same rights that i have with my wife '.

",
14671,1,,"one of the requirements set by the roman catholic church for priests is that they remain celibate.
",
14672,1,," celibacy is the renunciation of sex and marriage for the more perfect observance of chastity.
",
14673,1,," this vow of celibacy has been propelled to the forefront of public discussion by the recent accusations that the church conspired to protect priests accused of child molestation.
",
14674,1,," the vow of celibacy is seen by some as a cause of the paedophilia that seems to be rampant within the catholic church in america.
",
14675,0,," the vatican has not changed its stance on celibacy in the wake of the controversy, but some within the church have called for the elimination of the vow of celibacy.
",
14676,0,,"while celibacy had been encouraged since the beginning of the church , until the beginning of the twelfth century , when it was banned by the lateran councils ofand, priests in the western church were permitted to marry .
",
14677,0,," the bible does not mandate celibacy and , in fact , st peter , the first pope , was married .
",
14678,0,," even today within the catholic church celibacy is not universal as eastern rite catholics can marry and it is the norm that they do , and there are some lutheran and episcopalian ministers who have converted to catholicism .
",
14679,0,," the true history and traditions of the roman catholic church include the option for priests to marry or at least for married men to become priests .
",
14680,0,," the number of priests in developed countries is on the decline .
",
14681,0,," in ireland in160 priests died but only nine were ordained to replace them .
",
14682,0,," it is expected that the number of priests in ireland will fall fromintoby.
",
14683,0,," as a result almost 50,000 parishes worldwide are without a priest despite the number of parishes not having risen with the increase in numbers of catholics .
",
14684,0,," the prohibition on marriage pushes some men away from the priesthood .
",
14685,0,," the requirement of celibacy drastically reduces the pool from which the church can select priests and means that the church is not always getting the `` best and the brightest '' .
",
14686,0,," as a result even many within the church believe the demand for celibacy should be ended .
",
14687,0,," priestly celibacy is out-dated .
",
14688,0,," it sets the priest apart from the modern world and the experiences of his parishioners .
",
14689,0,," originally , aroundthe gregorian reform movement in the church was keen to enforce celibacy for fear that too many married priests would leave church property and benefices to their children , or create local priestly dynasties .
",
14690,0,," at the time these fears were reasonable and necessary to maintain the property and discipline of the church , but today they are utterly unnecessary .
",
14691,0,," the prospect of celibacy draws sexually dysfunctional men to the priesthood .
",
14692,0,," they hope that by totally denying their sexuality , they will not engage in deviant acts , but unfortunately they often can not overcome their deviant desires .
",
14693,0,," permitting priests to marry would bring men with healthy sexual desires to the priesthood .
",
14694,1,,"the majority of the population of the world is at least nominally committed to some religion or another.
",
14695,1,," and despite the perception in some parts of the western world that religious belief is in terminal decline, or that economic and social development go hand in hand with secularisation, there are many parts of the world where fundamentalist religious belief is firmly entrenched (including arguably the most ‘developed’ nation on earth, the usa).
",
14696,1,," religious belief, it seems, refuses to go away.
",
14697,1,," some people might think that religion is not an appropriate topic for debate – perhaps because it is too personal, too sacred, or outside the realms of rational debate.
",
14698,1,," for the rest of us, however, there is a fascinating and lively debate to be had.
",
14699,1,," there are many different dimensions to debates about religion.
",
14700,1,," to start with there is the philosophical question of how plausible belief in god is.
",
14701,1,," then there are social, moral, and political questions about the effects of religious belief on individuals and communities both in the present and historically.
",
14702,1,," has religious belief, on balance, been a force for good or for harm in the world?
",
14703,1,," this is an enormous area.
",
14704,1,,"the arguments below provide only the most basic of skeletons.
",
14705,1,," it is for debaters themselves to do research and find their own examples from the present and from history to substantiate and illustrate the arguments.
",
14706,1,," this can range across many areas such as: is it necessary for god to work in miracles in order to exist?
",
14707,1,," and why does his existence need to be proven?
",
14708,1,," if you were somewhere else, outside of the parameters of human sight, would you need a human being to verify your existence?
",
14709,1,," isn't evidence also interpretation and dependent on interpreting data?
",
14710,1,," if god is everything, like some people say, then aren't all living and non living things proof of god?
",
14711,1,," so then why is there punishment?
",
14712,1,," if good and evil is needed for the development of human beings, then why is it punishable by god?
",
14713,1,," he created this entity called evil and as a result, we may unknowingly or knowingly choose it.
",
14714,1,," do we blame a clock for not working properly or do we blame the creator of it?
",
14715,1,," why is it different with god, given that he is the ultimate decider of everything?
",
14716,1,," how can free will truly be free if it is being judged?
",
14717,1,," how can it be free choice if one choice is clearly favoured over another?
",
14718,1,," science has uncovered all mysteries?
",
14719,1,," how do you know this?
",
14720,1,," where did the energy needed for the big bang come from?
",
14721,1,," did this energy always exist or were they created out of nothing?
",
14722,1,," if energy always existed then matter is eternal if they didn't then shouldn't something have to account for their existence in a logical sense?
",
14723,1,," are there really no more questions?
",
14724,1,," does proving religion wrong prove the non-existence of a creator?
",
14725,1,," what about conscience?
",
14726,1,," do we not have the capacity to tell right from wrong?
",
14727,1,," and what is your definition of right or wrong?
",
14728,1,," is it determined through reason or is it determined through what you have been told?
",
14729,1,," is it absolute or relative?
",
14730,1,," doesn't religion in some cases accept, even order certain acts that would be considered wrong in many other situations?
",
14731,0,," why is it justified as right simply because it is ordained by religion?
",
14732,0,,"there is no evidence that god exists .
",
14733,0,," reported miracles , healings etc. are never reliably proved actually to have happened , and in any case everyone 's religious experiences are different and point to the psychological differences between human beings not to any objective divine reality .
",
14734,0,," belief in god is simply wish-fulfilment .
",
14735,0,," it would be nice if there was a loving all powerful being watching over us , but there is n't .
",
14736,0,," the world is full of suffering and pain among innocent people .
",
14737,0,," if god is good and all-powerful then why is this the case ?
",
14738,0,," either god does not exist or he is not worth believing in since he does not care about human suffering .
",
14739,0,," science provides us with the tools to form a comprehensive view of the universe which does not include a supernatural being .
",
14740,0,," from galileo to darwin to the modern day , scientists have continually uncovered the true natural mechanisms behind the creation and evolution of the universe .
",
14741,0,," there are no gaps left for god to act in - science has revealed a closed natural order governed by natural laws .
",
14742,0,," brain science has shown that there is not a ` soul ' but that all our mental states are simply caused by brain activity .
",
14743,0,," there is , therefore , no reason to believe in life after death - one of the main tenets of religious belief .
",
14744,0,," religions through the ages , and still today , have been agents of repression , sexism , elitism , homophobia , and - most of all - conflict , war , and racial hatred .
",
14745,0,," the very nature of belief in received wisdom means that it must be , at its core , a conservative and regressive force .
",
14746,0,," moreover the positive moral rules that religions claim to promote tend to have existed independently of those religions -- the world did not have to wait for the ten commandments to learn that murder and theft was wrong , but it waited until the 19th century to reach a consensus that slavery was wrong .
",
14747,0,," whatever small amount of psychological comfort religious belief may give , the evils it is responsible for in the social and political worlds easily outweigh it .
",
14748,0,," with regards to any proposition the only consistent and rational view is to assume that it is not true unless sufficient evidence is put forward to nullify that assumption .
",
14749,0,," the proposition need also be falsifiable , that is to say , there must be some potential fact that could be proven in order to disprove it .
",
14750,0,," god is unfalsifiable because there is nothing .
",
14751,1,,"the last few years have seen a renewed enthusiasm for atheism and secularism in much of the world and debates between believers and non-believers have become ever more vigorous.
",
14752,1,," one distinction that is frequently made, particularly by theists, is that between faith and religion.
",
14753,1,," whether such a distinction is meaningful or relevant does not fall within the purview of this debate, which focusses entirely on religion in the ordinary meaning of the word.
",
14754,1,," in addition it will focus primarily on the abrahamic religions (christianity, islam and judaism) purely on the basis that they represent the largest of the world’s religious traditions.
",
14755,1,,"debates on religious issues are notoriously challenging because the burdens of proof can vary hugely and the term covers so many traditions and so many exceptions- that there always seems to be a counterfactual available to any evidence-based argument.
",
14756,1,," take, for example, the well publicised and widely discussed roman catholic prohibition on contraception.
",
14757,1,," from a purely secular perspective, the decision makes no medical sense.
",
14758,1,," however, from a religious standpoint it encourages abstinence and faithfulness, which are seen as valuable normative goals in and of themselves.
",
14759,1,,"it would be wrong to ignore the fact that debates on religious issues also have a tendency to be heated and, in the case of public debates, can be frustrating because of the reluctance of anyone in the room to criticise their own views.
",
14760,1,," however, precisely because of these factors, discussions on the value of religion for excellent training and competitive debate topics.
",
14761,1,," debates on religion compel speakers and adjudicators not only to question their own views but to focus on the structure of arguments themselves, rather than relying on frameworks of assumed knowledge, as can often be the case in political debates.
",
14762,1,,"usually, debates on this motion run along the lines of the impact of religious organizations on various moral issues and the groups affected by them.
",
14763,1,," abortion, gay marriage, women’s rights and others tend to come up.
",
14764,1,," a common theme also tends to be the extent to which organisations are responsible for the actions of individuals who profess that particular faith.
",
14765,1,," there is a frequent claim that religions- or the organisations that represent them- get to pick and choose.
",
14766,1,," as a result, the argument goes, islam is not responsible for terrorist atrocities nor is the catholic church culpable for child sex abuse.
",
14767,1,," it’s an interesting distinction and one that is likely to exercise both sides of the debate.
",
14768,1,,"efforts to play the same argument the other way around against secularism do not really work, as it is difficult to find an instance of acts comparable to religiously sponsored intolerance being committed as a direct result of the actions of secularism.
",
14769,1,," opposition teams often resort to the use of examples that break goodwin’s law.
",
14770,1,," a desperate opposition team may discuss that securalist or atheist tendencies of hitler and stalin – although rarely to any effect.
",
14771,1,,"ultimately this is a debate that is all about defining the parameters of discussion.
",
14772,0,," it is all too easy for it to degenerate into general assertions about charity and bigotry and yet there is plenty of fact on both sides.
",
14773,0,,"it is a basic tenant of all religions that they divide humanity into ` us ' and ` them ' -- believers and non-believers .
",
14774,0,," however , the divisions of society perceived by religious believers do not stop there , and have a tendency to reflect the social and moral views of an earlier and far less progressive age .
",
14775,0,," as well as condemning those who practice other faiths , or who choose to follow no faith , they have fought , and continued to fight , the expansion of the rights of women and of socially marginalised castes , among other social groups .
",
14776,0,," all of the major churches and sects have had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world , and most of them are still desperately trying to ignore the existence of modernity .
",
14777,0,," while justifying their political and moral positions through obtuse and deliberately obscure interpretations of religious texts , obscure texts even the mainstream interpretations of major religions are usually sexist , frequently racist and almost universally homophobic .
",
14778,0,," preventing access to contraception is the single largest block to women getting out of poverty .
",
14779,0,," there are many other examples of the excesses and double standards of mainstream religion -- too many examples to pick one .
",
14780,0,," particularly in the case of contemporary islam , although other historical examples could be referred to , the combination of certainty and the promise of life after death is a sure route towards violence .
",
14781,0,," that said , catholics and protestants in northern ireland demonstrated this until recently ; the yugoslav wars between catholics , orthodox and muslims , both sides of the battle for israel/palestine and many others in history could also be thrown into the mix .
",
14782,0,," allowing people the opportunity to claim that `` god 's on our side '' can be used to justify anything , especially when he appears to be fighting on both sides .
",
14783,0,," although in much of the world the days of the crusades and the inquisition may be gone , there are plenty of nations were religious disobedience still is still punished harshly , summarily or extra-judicially .
",
14784,0,," in other countries , semi-official militias are left to enforce the minutiae of religious law , although usually in such a way as to disadvantage women and others already persecuted in society .
",
14785,0,," it should be noted that what tends to be the focus of such persecution is a lack of adherence to an ultra-orthodox position .
",
14786,0,," it is frequently a cover for political or social prejudice .
",
14787,0,," charges of heresy or apostasy are easy to level and nigh on impossible to disprove .
",
14788,0,," even beyond these extremes , demands for religious observance play out in us elections and , inexplicably , the views of religious leaders are sought on areas where they really have no relevant expertise at all , such as advances in medical progress .
",
14789,0,," those who disagree on matters such as stem cell research or gay rights are , apparently , arguing with the almighty .
",
14790,1,,"the topic of tolerance towards religious symbols has caused much controversy among many both in the western and eastern hemispheres.
",
14791,1,," religious symbols are incorporated into every religion and are expressions of both faith and devotion.
",
14792,1,," examples of religious symbols include the christian, particularly catholic, crucifix, the muslim hijab and the sikh kirpan.
",
14793,1,," for many people, particularly from the west, the hijab or muslim head covering symbolises the repressive and extremely regressive character of islam.
",
14794,1,," however, for its supporters, it represents the defence of women's modesty against the assault of modern society.
",
14795,1,," in this way, religious symbols and their meanings and consequences differ depending on cultural perception.
",
14796,1,," recent controversy has arisen around france's plan to ban the hijab, along with other visible religious symbols, in schools.
",
14797,1,," france's secular constitution provides the grounds for excluding religion from their schools.
",
14798,1,," however it is not just western countries who have taken this approach.
",
14799,1,," turkey has for many years suppressed the hijab in schools, public buildings and among employees of the state.
",
14800,1,," in the aftermath of 9/11, many minority muslim communities in western countries view attacks on the hijab as part of a wider attack on islam conducted in tandem with the 'war on terror'.
",
14801,1,," in a similar way, there is anxiety as to the freedom to bring sikh kirpans' to school because they are ceremonial daggers.
",
14802,1,," it should be noted that the sikh religion requires the kirpan to carried with the sikh at all times.
",
14803,1,," in this way, the practice of the religion is seen to be restricted and can, therefore, be possibly considered as discrimination.
",
14804,1,," however, there are other forms of religious symbolism that are not necessarily a requirement of the religion and are merely an expression of faith.
",
14805,1,," there was recent controversy over a british woman who lost her job simply because she continued wearing a crucifix after she was told not to by her employers.
",
14806,1,," all of these points present an interesting question.
",
14807,1,," should authorities be more lenient on religious symbols that are a requirement of the person?
",
14808,0,," also, should there be a limit to physical or material expressions of faith?
",
14809,0,,"religious symbols are seen to , in some cases , increase the equality divide between genders .
",
14810,0,," as an example , the muslim hijab is considered by some as a very powerful symbol for the oppression of women , particularly in countries such as saudi arabia or afghanistan where it is compulsory .
",
14811,0,," therefore , when it is worn in western countries that encourage democracy and equality , the wearing of the hijab is seen as almost counter-productive to the goals of democratic society .
",
14812,0,," for this reason belgium has recently banned the wearing of the full muslim veil , much like france in 2010.1 often muslim dress rules for women are seen as more severe than those for men .
",
14813,0,," inequality between men and women is a form of discrimination and liberal societies should fight all forms of discrimination .
",
14814,0,," as well as division in society in general , religious symbols are also a source of division within school environments .
",
14815,0,," the hijab causes schools many problems .
",
14816,0,," it is potentially divisive in the classroom , marking some children out as different from the others and above the rules that the school enforces for everyone else .
",
14817,0,," this may lead to alienation and bullying .
",
14818,0,," full headscarves may also be impractical or dangerous in some lessons , for example pe , swimming , or in technology and science lessons where machinery is being operated .
",
14819,0,," in the same way , there have been discussions as to whether to ban the display of crucifixes in public classrooms .
",
14820,0,," authorities in italy have followed through with the ban saying that such a christian symbol segregates those who are not christian .1 religious symbols can be seen as possible tools for fuelling division within society .
",
14821,0,," when some women wear the hijab it creates pressure on other muslim women to also cover their heads .
",
14822,0,," pressure comes both socially from wanting to look like other women in their community and religiously from imams and family leaders pressing for observance .
",
14823,0,," as such , muslims themselves are divided and religious oppression against women is internalized .1 approving of muslim head coverings in society cements the hijab as an essential tenet of islam , in the minds of non-muslims as well as believers .
",
14824,0,," however , many different schools of islam exist and as on other issues , they often disagree how to interpret the koran 's dress prescriptions .
",
14825,0,," moderate interpretations accept modest forms of modern dress while severe interpretations require full covering with the burka or similar veil .
",
14826,0,," banning the veil furthers the cause of moderate interpretations and prevents the entrenchment of severe interpretations .
",
14827,0,," a ban would be simple to create and enforce .
",
14828,0,," religious symbols are for the most part meant to be shown therefore it is simple for police or authorities to check that someone is not wearing them .
",
14829,0,," there are many societies that have had bans on a religious symbol in public buildings , for example in france where there is a ban on religious symbols in schools has been in force since.
",
14830,0,," in france the ban is made even easier to enforce by restricting it to ` conspicuous ' religious apparel .1 moreover when the ban is only when entering public buildings it can be enforced by the teacher , or the building 's security guards rather than being an issue for the police to deal with .
",
14831,0,," many societies are founded on secular values that do not permit the sponsorship of any religion by the state .
",
14832,0,," british society aspires to this and has consciously acted to separate religion from state authority with many organisations such as the national secular society encouraging the suppression of any religious expression in public places .1 in this climate it is important that all citizens of the state are seen as equal .
",
14833,0,," if some dress differently to others , deliberately identifying themselves as members of one religion , this can harm the unity and ethos of the state .
",
14834,0,," this holds particularly true for institutions of the state like schools and government offices .
",
14835,0,," in this way , it is possible to deduce that religious symbols are detrimental to the secular and equality focused identity of western society .
",
14836,1,,"a creative commons license is a kind of copyright license that gives people the right to use, share, and expand upon a creator’s work whether this is an art work, a piece of literature, or a scientific or academic material.
",
14837,1,," it offers a significant protection against accusations of copyright infringement and is believed by some to offer artists flexibility they may desire.
",
14838,1,," however it also erodes artists’ control of their work because it can be reused without permission meaning it may be used in contexts which the original creator may not have envisaged or approve of.
",
14839,1,,"attendant in all this is the additional issue of how the government should license work that it commissions.
",
14840,1,," work for government is almost by definition being carried out for the people in one form or another so should all work done by government have a creative commons license and therefore be open to those people?
",
14841,1,," the state engages in a lot of work that is licensed; it funds art, and culture (usually only in part) but the state also funds scientific and academic research, the creation of large amounts of software, the creation of large data resources, the development of weapons systems, for all creative commons licencing could apply but in some cases it may not be wise to do so.
",
14842,1,,"some governments, such as the united states already go part way towards making work they fund available to the public.
",
14843,1,," any “government [that] work is prepared by an officer or employee of the united states government as part of that person's official duties” is in the public domain.
",
14844,1,," which means they are similarly open to reuse and reproduction as if they were creative commons.
",
14845,1,," however it is notable that this does not apply to works produced by government contractors or by institutions that are largely or fully funded by government such as the smithsonian which this motion includes.
",
14846,0,," everyone benefits and is enriched by open access to resources that the government can provide .
",
14847,0,," a work is the province of its creator in most respects , since it is from the mind and hand of its creator that it is born .
",
14848,0,," but when the state opts to fund a project , it too becomes a part-owner of the ideas and creation that springs forth .
",
14849,0,," the state should thus seek to make public the work it spends taxpayer money to create .
",
14850,0,," this is in exactly the same way that when an employee of a company creates something presuming there is the correct contract the rights to that work go to the company not the employee .
",
14851,0,," the best means for doing this is through mandating that work created with state funding be released under creative commons licenses , which allow the work to be redistributed , re-explored , and to be used as springboards for new , derivative works .
",
14852,0,," this is hampered by either the creator , or the government , retaining stricter forms of copyright , which effectively entitles the holder of the copyright to full control of the work that would not exist had it not been for the largesse of society .
",
14853,0,," if state funded work is to have meaning it must be in the public sphere and reusable by the public in whatever form they wish .
",
14854,0,," simply put taxpayer bought so they own it .
",
14855,0,," current copyright law assigns too many rights , automatically , to the creator .
",
14856,0,," law gives the generator a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse , except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements .
",
14857,0,," making the creative commons license the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of people 's defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like .
",
14858,0,," the creative commons license guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors , something that is particularly useful for building programs that need to be maintained .
",
14859,0,," at base the default setting of somehow having absolute control means creators of work often do not even consider the reuse by others in the commons .
",
14860,0,," the result is creation and then stagnation , as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator .
",
14861,0,," by normalizing the creative commons through the state funding system , more people will be willing to accept the creative commons as their private default .
",
14862,0,," this means greater access to more works , for the enrichment of all .
",
14863,0,," the result is that a norm is created whereby the assumption is that information should be open and shared rather than controlled and owned for profit by an individual or corporation .
",
14864,0,," all governments recognise a right to freedom of information as part of freedom of expression making it the government 's responsibility to provide access to public information and many are enabling this through creating freedom of information acts .
",
14865,0,," this is simply another part of that right .
",
14866,0,," the nature of the internet and mass media is such that many creators can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them .
",
14867,0,," creative commons provides vast benefits in allowing a creation to have life after its funding has run out or beyond its original specifications .
",
14868,0,," creative commons means that the original work can be considered to be a building block that can simply be used as a foundation for more applications and modifications .
",
14869,0,," for example in many countries government has for decades produced official maps for the country but these can only be irregularly updated -- often with a new release of a paper map .
",
14870,0,," however the internet means that maps could easily be regularly updated online by enthusiastic users and volunteers as things change on the ground if those maps were available under creative commons .
",
14871,0,," this is why applications like openstreetmap or google maps , which is not creative commons but can be easily built upon by creative commons projects , are now much more successful than traditional mapping and has often forced government map providers to follow suit such as the uk 's ordnance survey making many of its maps free and downloadable .
",
14872,0,," it is important to recollect that those operating under a creative commons license still maintain control of the marketable aspects of their work and can enter into deals for the commercial distribution of their works .
",
14873,1,,"digital rights management (drm) is a kind of technology, normally software-based, that is used to prevent unauthorised copying of digital media, usually by restricting the context in which that media can be used.
",
14874,1,," for example, only allowing music to be played on one particular portable player.
",
14875,1,,"drm is most often used to protect music, films, and computer software.
",
14876,1,," some examples of drm usage are music purchased from apple’s itunes store (which are linked to an itunes account), films on dvds (which are scrambled), and the online activation found in microsoft’s windows operating system (copies of the software must be activated).
",
14877,1,,"since drm is used to protect digital media, often purchased over the internet, it is common in many countries.
",
14878,1,,"  us and eu legislation enforces the provisions of theworld intellectual property organisation (wipo) copyright treaty.
",
14879,1,," both the us digital millennium copyright act (dmca)(1998) and the eu copyright directive (2001) protect drm technologies in addition to making simple piracy illegal by prohibiting technologies which circumvent drm protection.
",
14880,1,,"some people believe that drm is not the most effective way protect digital media.
",
14881,0,," this discussion covers arguments for and against drm usage in at least some instances.
",
14882,0,,"drm has a ` chilling effect ' on genuine technological research , preventing legitimate reverse-engineering of technologies for research purposes , particularly in university departments which do n't get funding for this because of the potential legal issues .
",
14883,0,," in the usa the dmca has also been cited as chilling to legitimate users , such as students of cryptanalysis , including , in a well-known instance , professor felten and students at princeton , and security consultants such as niels ferguson , who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the dmca when he travels to the us .
",
14884,0,," it is generally accepted in most legal jurisdictions that copying media for the use of others is a form of stealing and should remain illegal .
",
14885,0,," however , this should be enforced by targeting pirates who produce large quantities of copied media in bulk , rather than targeting innocent or low-impact home users sharing songs with a friend or transferring a song from a cd to an mp3 player for listening on the move .
",
14886,0,," such home users make little difference to the viability of the media or software industries , but the actions of pirates impact upon their ability to make profits from the intellectual property they own .
",
14887,0,," a good example of this is the drm on the blu-ray edition of the film avatar which rendered the discs unplayable on many blu-ray players .
",
14888,0,," drm is n't effective against piracy and so we should see it as an anti-competitive practice and trade barrier which makes life worse for consumers and does n't bring benefits to artists or the music industry in the long run .
",
14889,0,," drm technology should be considered an infringement on types of legitimate ` fair use ' consumer use , harming rights for consumers which are protected under the world intellectual property organisation copyright treaty ,.
",
14890,0,," drm aims to make it impossible to create compilations of songs & videos that you already own .
",
14891,0,," microsoft zune 's limited sharing technology prevents unlimited streaming between two devices owned by the same individual .
",
14892,0,," activation schemes frequently incorrectly tell users that they are using pirated products when reinstallation is attempted after a crash , for instance the windows ` genuine advantage ' scheme .
",
14893,0,," further , drm makes it very difficult for firms who operate thousands of computers to install multiple copies , volume licenses often do away with drm , resulting in a huge economic cost to them in terms of having to install on every system separately .
",
14894,0,," evidence of an acknowledgement of this counter-productivity came when emi stopped releasing audio cds with drm in januarybecause of the sheer number of cd players they were incompatible with .
",
14895,0,," they themselves admitted that `` the costs of drm do not measure up to the results '' .
",
14896,0,," continued reliance on drm inhibits the industry shift towards new models of content management for the future .
",
14897,0,," the media industry needs to preserve its revenue by moving in at least some ways in the direction of the creative commons agreement .
",
14898,0,," drm goes in exactly the opposite direction .
",
14899,0,," it hurts the firms because it gives consumers a negative experience and places the burden on them to prove that they are n't pirating , but does n't even stop those who actually pirate .

",
14903,1,,"3d printing is a revolutionary method of manufacturing.
",
14904,1,," it is an additive process, meaning that it builds layer over layer of material in any shape using a laser, and does not waste as much material as cutting or drilling larger blocks into the desired shape (subtractive manufacturing).
",
14905,1,," recently, they have begun to become accessible to households, and the price has dropped from several thousands to several hundreds of dollars.1 however, the industry is still massively underdeveloped.
",
14906,1,," while 3d printers have been known to produce truly ground-breaking things, such as food or human organs2, these are the exceptions.
",
14907,1,," 3d printing still faces many limitations: it is slow, materials can be very expensive, machines are highly specific so you need different ones for different purposes, and they mainly produce brittle products with a rough surface.3nonetheless, the industry is developing tremendously fast, and the possibilities, both positive and negative, seem endless.
",
14908,1,," a particularly loaded question is that of the domestic use of 3d printers.
",
14909,1,," on one hand, they may eventually provide people with cheap access to endless necessities from home and allow individuals to produce anything they like enabling them to compete with large corporations.
",
14910,1,," on the other, very shortly after 3d printers became a known concept, people began spreading blueprints of plastic printable guns on the internet.
",
14911,1,," this allowed anybody with a 3d printer to produce their own weapons without any skill or great effort.4 as printers develop, producing guns, drugs or any dangerous product will be inexpensive and impossible to regulate.
",
14912,0,," such a new type of technology seems to call for drastically adapting existing regulations: but is it sufficient to justify a ban on 3d printers in households while this is still possible?
",
14913,0,,"while 3d printing may revolutionise professional manufacturing and lead to less waste , in the household it promotes mindless consumerism .
",
14914,0,," by producing anything desired cheaply and more accessibly , without even having to leave your house , they encourage people consume much more than they otherwise would .
",
14915,0,," this happens because individual consumers tend not to be concerned about the sustainability implications of every purchase : they will do so even less when 3d printers allow instant gratification .
",
14916,0,," on one hand , it can make people more dependent on material possessions , which makes it harder for them to attain more sustainable forms of happiness .
",
14917,0,," additionally , this eventually leads to more waste and overproduction , reversing all the potential benefits of industrial 3d printing .
",
14918,0,," as the technology develops , it seems likely that guns like the one created by defense distributed will continue to appear , becoming cheaper , more functional and more accessible .
",
14919,0,," while the us succeeded in promptly removing the blueprints , removing blueprints from the internet will quickly prove impossible as the phenomenon inevitably becomes more widespread .5 this is dangerous for all the same reasons that we do not allow people to produce their own weapons : we can not ensure criminals or mentally ill people do not gain access to them , and we can not track them after they have been used to commit a crime .
",
14920,0,," furthermore , they can be made of plastic , thus making them essentially undetectable to most security scans .
",
14921,0,," when weapons become so easily accessible , crimes become easier for terrorists or criminals to commit , and thus more crimes take place .
",
14922,0,," by banning printers before blueprints spread , we could avoid disasters such as thebombings in madrid , in which the bombs were produced from instructions on the internet6 .
",
14923,0,," similarly , the production of drugs and other illegal substances becomes impossible to regulate when anybody can produce anything in their own homes from plans on the internet .
",
14924,0,," restricting the spread of blueprints online is impossible , so the physical means of production must be regulated before they become irreversibly accessible .
",
14925,0,," banning household 3d printers , therefore , is a necessary step to uphold the rules we find important to our safety .
",
14926,0,," the great appeal of 3d printers is that they make consuming more efficient than normal methods : however , normal methods are inefficient in part because they undergo important checks and balances .
",
14927,0,," without proper regulations , standards are quickly dropped to save money and the health of thousands of consumers is put at risk .
",
14928,0,," such is the case in china , where consumer protection regulations are inefficient .7 through 3d printing this becomes a global problem .
",
14929,0,," any company , real or fake , can sell products online without them having been approved .
",
14930,0,," this means that people may buy dangerous products from unidentifiable , and thus legally unaccountable , companies .
",
14931,0,," shifting the burden of ensuring safety standards away from companies and onto consumers , who have significantly less information , is a threat to consumers ' health and safety .
",
14932,0,," all nations to develop economically depend on the importation of capital .
",
14933,0,," in most cases , this takes the shape of labour-intense manufacturing .
",
14934,0,," in fact , scarcely any countries have developed without transitioning through having a large manufacturing sector .8 it takes time for these countries to develop the capital and infrastructure to enter higher barrier to entry markets , such as the service sector .
",
14935,0,," transitioning without of manufacturing is therefore not an option for the majority of developing nations , and the exceptions that have succeeded in creating economic growth without large scale manufacturing , such as india and sri lanka , relied on spectacular luck .9 as a result , many developing nations depend on exporting cheap products to the developed world , where consumption is the highest .
",
14936,0,," if demand for the goods they produce is satisfied in the developed world , such countries will be unable to export .
",
14937,0,," because of the labour intensiveness of the manufacturing this will affect a large number of people .
",
14938,0,," short term drops in growth are particularly harmful in the developing world , where social security is too underdeveloped to cushion their effect .
",
14939,0,," people who work long hours for minimal wages do so because unemployment is not an option .
",
14940,0,," were these factories to have to close suddenly , the social consequences would be devastating .
",
14941,0,," 3d printers provoke this to happen by satisfying all demand for cheap products .
",
14942,0,," when individuals in western liberal democracies can get access to cheaper products from their own home , developing nations will be unable to compete , and their exports fall substantially .
",
14943,0,," 3d printers should remain at the industry level , where companies are more likely to rationally prefer importing cheap products over the extra costs of using 3d printers , such as electricity , and are likely to continue trade with the third world .
",
14944,0,," intellectual property law is split into copyright , design protection , patents , and trademarks .
",
14945,0,," all areas can be easily infringed by 3d printing .13 there is no meaningful way of sustaining these laws against individuals who choose to use 3d printers to benefit from the hard work of others .
",
14946,0,," much in the same way one can steal music online , blueprints for products can be decoded or stolen and subsequently reproduced at almost no expense .
",
14947,0,," it may be impossible to determine where this has been done .14 this is unjust in itself , but it also creates a large deterrent from innovating by removing the profit incentive .
",
14948,0,," corporations and individuals will be pushed away from creating high quality innovative products if they know their blueprints can be pirated and spread online for free or for less than they themselves charge , making their effort in creating them worthless .
",
14949,1,,"the right of asylum is a juridical concept, under which a person, in this case a woman, persecuted by her own government may be protected by another sovereign authority, a foreign country, or a union of countries.
",
14950,1,,"legislation is a law that has been enacted by a governing body and is currently part of the legal system in that country with the purpose to regulate, authorize, sanction, grant or restrict certain individual liberties.
",
14951,1,,"discriminatory legislation against women is not restricted to any one region or group of states but is best known in countries such as saudi arabia and others with legal system strongly influenced by sharia, the moral code and religious law of islam.
",
14952,1,," even if the quran states that men and women are equal, it also sustains that “men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because allah has made one of them to respect the other, and because they spend from their means.”
",
14953,1,,"sharia law applies in full, covering personal status issues as well as criminal proceedings, in mauritania, sudan, saudi arabia, yemen, iraq, iran etc. there are also countries in which sharia applies in personal status issues only (marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody), which is the case in much of the middle east north africa region but there it is also applied in some regions of indonesia.
",
14954,1,," it should be noted that not all islamic countries apply sharia law.
",
14955,1,," discrimination can take a wide verity of different forms.
",
14956,1,," at its worst women become the “property” of the man and they cannot pursue anything without his approval.
",
14957,1,," they are treated poorly by not being equal in front of the justice system, punishment for adultery consist most of the times in stoning or female genitalia mutilation.
",
14958,1,," elsewhere however discrimination may simply be unequal representation in the political system.
",
14959,0,,"    everyone is equal .
",
14960,0,," women who live under legal system that permits discrimination against them are being denied of basic human rights whether this is the right to vote , to a fair trial , or bodily integrity .
",
14961,0,," sharia law , for example , clearly denies them human rights like equality before the law , a basic human need according to universal declaration of human rights .
",
14962,0,," `` all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law . ''
",
14963,0,," under sharia a woman 's testimony is worth half a man 's and she gets half the inheritance of her male siblings .
",
14964,0,," second of all , bodily integrity is affected when women are stoned to death or beaten by their husbands without them even being punished .
",
14965,0,," the importance of self-determination and autonomy are neglected in saudi arabia where women are not allowed to drive or go alone in public .
",
14966,0,," female genital mutilation , which causes bleeding , infections and infertility , and is almost always done without the girl 's consent , is a big problem in many african countries .
",
14967,0,," asylum given by the eu shall be the only way for these women to leave the system that persecutes them and be able to have their human needs respected and therefore creating a healthier , safer and better environment .
",
14968,0,," the european union is not able to protect women in other countries that are not a part of the union .
",
14969,0,," countries that have legislation discriminating against women are clearly not listening to european urgings on human rights .
",
14970,0,," they will not respond to these urgings social and cultural traditions are deeply ingrained and only slowly change .
",
14971,0,," where women are seen as second-tier citizens it is seen as a natural part of the society can barely walk to the corner of the street without the consent of their husband .
",
14972,0,," moreover , the situation in countries with legislated discrimination against women is not improving , in countries which were previously secular there is increasingly a challenge from islamism as in libya and egypt during the ` arab spring ' .
",
14973,0,," moreover the influence of the european union is declining ; it has always been primarily financial , through aid which is declining , and through investment which , at least in the mena , region has reversed as a result of those same revolutions .
",
14974,0,," by granting asylum we can help them escape a legal system that clearly is against them and replace it with a european union legal system that grants them those rights they never had .
",
14975,0,," sometimes , women who are persecuted by their government end up running from their country just to be sent back from the eu when their asylum application is rejected .
",
14976,0,," under the current legal system , the problems of women from countries that implement sharia law and other forms of discrimination are often not considered sufficient grounds for asylum .
",
14977,0,," this is because refugees are only considered to be refugees ` owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ' , so it does not include persecution for gender .
",
14978,0,," the consequences can be of two kinds .
",
14979,0,," the first and the worst is sending them back home where to face harsh punishment for trying to leave .
",
14980,0,," this was the case with two women who applied for asylum in great britain inand were denied this right even though they faced death by stoning upon return .
",
14981,0,," even if the women are not sent home immediately due to a prolonged appeals process they are left in detention centers , in uncomfortable conditions and unable to get a job or do anything while they wait .
",
14982,0,," those who are denied entry are left with nothing only a long depressing wait to be returned to the horrible conditions from which they thought they had escaped .
",
14983,0,," there is a moral obligation for such a powerful and diverse group of nations to protect not only their own citizens but also people in desperate need all around the world .
",
14984,0,," all the countries in the eu have signed the universal declaration of human rights and therefore stand behind its principles .
",
14985,0,," as the world biggest economic power the eu is fully capable of doing so .
",
14986,0,," the union is wealthy enough that it can take in the extra migrants that would occur as a result of taking in women from countries where they face discriminatory legislation .
",
14987,0,," the european union 's international image is not based on its military might but upon its economy and on being upstanding in its promotion of a human rights agenda .
",
14988,0,," granting asylum to women that live under discriminatory legal system reinforces this image of being concerned for human rights .
",
14989,0,," the european union has signed up to the united nations ' convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women by which signatories `` agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women '' while the convention is calling for the elimination of discrimination internally it is fully in the spirit of the convention to undertake actions that encourage others to fulfill the convention .
",
14990,0,," by being willing to grant asylum to women from countries that have not lived up to the standards of the convention -- which includes `` to adopt appropriate legislative and other measures , including sanctions where appropriate , prohibiting all discrimination against women '' -- the european union will put pressure on these regimes , helping to highlight their unequal systems .
",
14991,0,," women who are constantly threatened by their husbands or who are in societies where they are considered to represent less than a man will most certainly lack ambition to achieve their full potential -- or even if they do have the ambition will be restrained from fulfilling it .
",
14992,0,," when you live under a system that considers you inferior to the other gender and denies you opportunities on the basis of gender -- sometimes including education the individual is clearly never going to have a chance to make their life worthwhile for its own sake .
",
14993,0,," they wo n't be able to take up jobs that will have an impact on the world , they wo n't control their own economic circumstances as their husband is the only breadwinner , and they will be denied the opportunity to express their ideas and views .
",
14994,0,," by giving them asylum in a place where women and men are treated equally , we give them the opportunity to do whatever they wanted to do before .
",
14995,0,," besides the security that they will gain , they will be able to go to school or get a job more easily than in their native country .
",
14996,0,," there is no reason for which we do n't want these women to be a part of our european cultural identity .
",
14997,0,," it is shameful to give this opportunity only to your citizens when women from countries that discriminate against them might be able to contribute so much more than they are able to under their circumstances in their native country .
",
14998,1,,"the age of consent refers to the age at which a person’s assent to have sex is recognised as valid in the eyes of the law.
",
14999,1,," men (and sometimes women, depending upon local law) who engage in sexual activity with young men or women below this age are therefore guilty of a criminal offence.
",
15000,1,," this is true even if it was the young person who wanted to have sex and agreed to it in total understanding of what they were doing – the agreement of the person below the age of consent is simply invalid in the eyes of the law.
",
15001,1,," yet in many countries this offence (often called ‘statutory rape’, as in the usa) is one that is very severely punished, sometimes with a sentence of up to life imprisonment.
",
15002,1,," ages of consent also vary greatly depending on sexuality, in most countries people have to be older to consent to homosexual sex than to heterosexual sex.
",
15003,1,," it is the combination of these factors that make age of consent laws highly controversial.
",
15004,1,,"age of consent laws are highly complex because of their many variations, and therefore all too often create difficulty for students in age of consent debates.
",
15005,1,," to avoid confusion it is best to:(a) firstly think about the ‘basic’ age of consent rule: for heterosexuals -no sex with anyone belowin england,in most parts of australia,in canada,in italy and varying from state to state betweenandin the u.s.a.(b) secondly think about the ‘plus’ element – many places in addition to the ‘basic’ rule, also make it an offence for you to have sex with persons below a certain age (usuallyor 21) if that person is in a relationship of ‘trust or dependency’ with you.
",
15006,1,," this would include relationships between children in foster care and those responsible for their welfare, and those between teacher and student.
",
15007,1,," such places include england, australia and canada.
",
15008,1,,"(c) thirdly think about the ‘minus’ element – in subtraction from the above two rules, states may make it not an offence if: (i) you reasonably thought the person was above the ‘basic’ age; or (ii) you reasonably thought you were married to the person ; or (iii) both partners are in similar age (usually 2-5 years).
",
15009,1,," in most jurisdictions if the adolescent is really, really young (i.e.in england) then even these ‘minus’ elements will not be allowed as a defence.
",
15010,1,,"there are therefore an almost infinite number of ways in which age of consent laws can be reformed.
",
15011,1,," it is less important to know the age details of each rule in each country (16 years?
",
15012,1,,"years?
",
15013,1,," 14?
",
15014,1,," 15?)
",
15015,1,,".
",
15016,1,," it is instead very important to think about the ‘basic’, ‘plus’, and ‘minus’ ideas in age of consent laws (such as, should it be a defence if someone had sex with a really, really young girl but honestly believed she was above the legal age of consent?)
",
15017,1,,".
",
15018,1,,"this article considers the arguments whether, in principle, age of consent rules should be made more liberal (lower or no ‘basic’ age and more generous ‘minus’ elements) or made stricter (same or higher ‘basic’ age and with less or no allowance for ‘minus’ elements).
",
15019,0,," the freedom of sexual expression , and exploration , is not only a matter of choice which is fundamental to the individual -- it is also particularly important to young people as they proceed through the stage of adolescence into young adulthood .
",
15020,0,," age of consent laws place artificial limits on this freedom .
",
15021,0,," sex is entirely natural and should be celebrated in the context of loving relationships , not criminalised and put under the prying eye of an authoritarian state .
",
15022,0,," violence , coercion and exploitation in sexual relationships should still be punished , but not consensual activity .
",
15023,0,," such restrictions go against the human rights to privacy and of freedom of expression .
",
15024,0,," the concept that young people do not know what they are doing is flawed , because every person who has gone through sexual development has learnt by doing .
",
15025,0,," there is no process of suddenly coming into full knowledge without acting and exploration .
",
15026,0,," such exploration would be more safely done in an environment that does n't criminalize it .
",
15027,0,," such criminalization can actaully lead to the very harm that the law ostensibly seeks to avoid , coercion and exploitation , for it is people who are naturally more inclined to coercion and exploitation that will disregard the law anyway .
",
15028,0,," this feeds the lambs to the wolves .
",
15029,0,," some countries have one age of consent for young females , say, and a different , higher age of consent for young males or for having anal sex , say.
",
15030,0,," this means that a heterosexual adult male who wants to have sex with a 17-year-old female is free to do so , but a homosexual adult male can not have intercourse with a young man who is.
",
15031,0,," not only are such laws clearly discriminatory , they entrench and perpetuate the myths , stereotypes , and prejudices against homosexuals and homosexual sex .
",
15032,0,," age of consent laws , if we are to have them at all , should be equalised across the genders .
",
15033,0,," the idea that young people should not be having sex is a leftover relic from the past : its justifications are anachronistic and have little place in modern times .
",
15034,0,," age of consent laws were the product of a ` purity campaign ' in britain in the 1800s , when it was believed that sex was a ` male privilege ' , that it led to the sexual ruin of young women , that it meant the loss of their virtue , which was a fate worse than death , and that it contributed to women 's second class citizenship .
",
15035,0,," in the uk the age ofwas chosen and set in, more thanyears ago , and has remained ever since .
",
15036,0,," today these ideas would offend both men and women .
",
15037,0,," age of consent laws are in fact dangerous because they drive underground the very people who should be , and are in most need of , receiving contraceptives , advice on safe sex , and access to health and other educational services .
",
15038,0,," this is true both of the ` statutory rapist ' as well as the under-16 consenting ` victim ' , who may worry about having assisted in the commission of a crime .
",
15039,0,," both parties then become real victims as they are put at greater risk of contracting stds or unwanted pregnancies .
",
15040,1,,"  although arranged marriages are an entrenched cultural norm in many european-asian communities, there is still a lot of controversy over their practice.
",
15041,1,," although there are differences in the ways cultures carry them out, they can be broadly defined as forms of matrimony where the individuals involved are brought together by parents or family members, and not necessarily through their own choices.
",
15042,1,," however they are different from forced marriages in the sense that arrange marriages can involve the consent of the man and woman at the centre.
",
15043,1,," forced marriage was made punishable by law in the uk in early 2012.
",
15044,1,," before then laws were introduced in britain inallowing people to apply for forced marriage protection orders, where penalties for its breach can include up to two years in prison.
",
15045,1,," france also banned forced marriages and tried in recent years to discourage its continued usage via public education campaigns.
",
15046,1,," yet arranged marriages are practiced across societies in south asia, north africa and the middle east, particularly in communities that are predominantly hindu and muslim.
",
15047,1,," many diaspora communities in britain also practice them, and it was widespread among white europeans for centuries.
",
15048,1,," however many people in the west now see it as clashing far too much with more modern ideas of marriage where people often enter into matrimony independently of their families.
",
15049,1,,"  however, sympathisers claim that arranged marriages are not necessarily damaging or threatening to young men or women if they are not forced, and are a vital part of the cultural heritage and functioning of various diaspora communities in europe.
",
15050,1,,"    as the use of forced marriage already carries strict penalties, this debate will focus purely on arranged marriages.
",
15051,1,," the mechanism would be to outlaw marriages where the individuals at the centre have been introduced to each other by parents or relatives and had little or no contact with each other beforehand.
",
15052,1,," police officers, social workers and other public service workers would be made aware of the new regulations and be required to make those in their communities who might be vulnerable more aware of their rights.
",
15053,0,,"  even if marriages are not made absolutely mandatory , covert family pressure can still propel people into unions where they will be unhappy .
",
15054,0,," this is a form of restricted liberty as the consequences of people rebelling against arranged marriages can include being forced to leave home or suffering stigmatisation and reduced contact with family members .
",
15055,0,," the stigma may also be the other way with the family feeling shame when their children reject their arrangements this in turn can lead to attempts at compulsion and even some cases like that of shafilea ahmed murder for the rejection of the marriage .
",
15056,0,," clearly there is a thin line between arranged and forced marriages .
",
15057,0,," although things like stigmatisation are harder to police than physical intimidation or violence , it is only right that the state steps in to regulate these harms , giving people the legal mandate to challenge the practice as well as to discourage relatives from attempting it from the outset .
",
15058,0,," arranged marriages have not been a part of the cultures of most european countries for many years now .
",
15059,0,," part of the reason for this is because ideas about marriage have become more progressive , with people accepting that men and women of any orientation should be allowed to choose their own partners .
",
15060,0,," this was even the case during the socially conservative era of the 1950s , when it was generally accepted in countries like britain that people would court and meet their partners independently of their parents .
",
15061,0,," arranged marriages also conform to a view of women in particular which regards them as chattel .
",
15062,0,," this does not fit in with the type of egalitarianism many european countries seek to practice , and thus does not conform to western notions of individual rights .
",
15063,0,," it is also hypocritical to adopt a double-standard with diaspora communities , turning a blind eye to practices which many other majority groups find reprehensible .
",
15064,0,," the rights and norms of a country of block of countries such as the eu must apply to all .
",
15065,0,," arranged marriages are often different when practiced in the home countries of many immigrant families in europe , where women often have networks of friends and relatives to rely on .
",
15066,0,," the danger with allowing arranged marriages to happen in eu countries are that the women at the centre are often far more vulnerable , away from their own family , unfamiliar with the local language and fully reliant on their husband 's family .
",
15067,0,," this makes it easier for domestic abuses to go undetected which is simply compounding problems of underreporting .
",
15068,0,," it is therefore likely that there is more domestic violence within arranged marriages .
",
15069,0,," this is shown even amongst women who still consented to arranged marriages but faced abuse from their husbands -- such as with the case of razia sodagar , whose husband abandoned her for another woman after she failed to fall pregnant .
",
15070,0,," this illustrates how it is not always easy to draw a clear division between arranged marriages and forced marriages , as the former can often bear the same characteristics as the latter .
",
15071,0,," it would therefore be safer to outlaw both .
",
15072,1,,"an amnesty can be defined as ‘a general pardon, esp for offences against a government’.
",
15073,1,," in the case of illegal immigrants this would be for the offence of entering and remaining in a country illegally and would in most cases not apply to those who have committed other crimes so there is usually an emphasis that an amnesty would only be for those who are law abiding – except for being in the country illegally.
",
15074,1,," amnesties may be granted by the executive or the legislature for a country, in the case of a general amnesty for migrants this would probably need both and would likely be a highly controversial move in any country.
",
15075,1,," politics about illegal immigrants are likely to be more highly charged in countries that already have a lot of migrants (whether legal or illegal) which means that migration is considered an social and economic issue that affects much of the electorate.
",
15076,1,,"despite their potential for controversy amnesties for illegal immigrants are not uncommon.
",
15077,1,," poland granted an amnesty for illegal immigrants in 2011, newt gingrich has made some kind of amnesty part of his campaign for the republican nomination for the presidency in the united states and it was also a campaign pledge in the in the uk general election by the liberal democrats in 2010.
",
15078,1,," while the uk has never granted a general amnesty and the united states has only had one in some countries they are quite common; france and portugal have offered two each, italy five and spain six amnesties.
",
15079,1,,"the proposition in the debate would have to give some idea of what conditions they are attaching to the amnesty and whether there are any limitations on it.
",
15080,1,," often more there are proposals for more limited amnesties rather than a general amnesty in order to reduce the political backlash that could result from a more indiscriminate policy.
",
15081,0,," amnesty is the only way to deal with the fundamental problem behind immigration ; the developed world much richer and has more jobs available than the developing world .
",
15082,0,," for example the usa has a per capita gdp of $ 48,100 by comparison mexico 's is only $ 15,100 using ppp the gap with the central american countries to the south of mexico is even starker with guatemalan gdp/capita at $ 5,000 .
",
15083,0,," not surprisingly the usa far outstrips the central american countries in the human development index ; the us is 4th , mexico 57th and guatemala 131st .
",
15084,0,," so long as there is such diversity of income and opportunity immigrants will keep coming , and this will continue no matter what the state that is receiving migrants does in an attempt to deter them .
",
15085,0,," amnesties will help allow labour to get to where it is needed , through nafta the us is integrating north america but it is specifically excluding labour from this integration while tightening border controls at the mexican border .
",
15086,0,," amnesties would help to counter-act the problems caused by leaving labour as the resource that is not allowed to cross borders and so provide benefits to both the host economy and the country of origin for the migrants .
",
15087,0,," this is because the migrants will send back remittances that will help to develop their home nation and they themselves may well return after developing new skills that can then be put to use at home .
",
15088,0,," migrants , including illegal migrants , are necessary for the economies of rich countries .
",
15089,0,," there are schemes run by these countries that allow the migration of skilled workers for jobs where there is a skills shortage in the native population , for example the united kingdom takes in a lot of migrants to work as doctors and migrants .
",
15090,0,," however these schemes fail to acknowledge that migrants are also vital for unskilled jobs which native workers are often unwilling to take ; for example jobs in catering , picking crops and cleaning .
",
15091,0,," approximately 6.3 million illegal immigrants are working in the usa , and these are benefiting the economy .
",
15092,0,," the federal reserve bank of dallas says `` the pace of recent u.s. economic growth would have been impossible without immigration .
",
15093,0,," since, immigrants have contributed to job growth in three main ways : they fill an increasing share of jobs overall , they take jobs in labor-scarce regions , and they fill the types of jobs native workers often shun . ''
",
15094,0,," amnesties are necessary to ensure the economy keeps benefiting from these workers .
",
15095,0,," much of the rich world is aging , and in a few cases is close to having a declining population .
",
15096,0,," as a result the size of the available workforce will decrease .
",
15097,0,," for example in germany bya third of the population will be over, and over the nextyears will as a result loose five million workers from the current workforce ofmillion .
",
15098,0,," while increasing retirement age can mean that these reductions in the size of the workforce come later to maintain the size of the workforce immigration or a rapid increase in birth rate is necessary .
",
15099,0,," these countries in order to maintain the size of their economies will therefore either have to rapidly increase productivity , which itself may not be easy as they are already the most productive nations , or else allow migrants to fill the gaps in the labour force .
",
15100,0,," at the same time there will be an increase in some jobs that rely on migrants such as care workers to help look after the increasing number of elderly .
",
15101,1,,"this is not about states limiting or banning people from having children.
",
15102,1,," nor is it about individuals who, for medical reasons, are unable to have babies.
",
15103,1,," instead, the house may be understood as people, couples or just women.
",
15104,1,," the debate will therefore focus on pros and cons of individuals having children.
",
15105,1,," globally more and more families are choosing not to have children.
",
15106,1,," in canada in 2006, 17.1 percent of women agedtosaid “no,” as did 18.3 percent of men in the same category when asked whether they were planning to have children.
",
15107,1,," in the u.s. national center of health statistics reports that the number of american women of childbearing age who define themselves as “child-free” rose sharply in the past generation: 6.2 per cent of women inbetween the ages ofandreported that they don’t expect to have children in their lifetime, up from 4.9 per cent in 1982.
",
15108,1,," in the uk inalmost 50% of married couples were living without children.
",
15109,1,," also, 58% of cohabiting couples were childless.
",
15110,1,," it has becomes so worrying in many countries that many countries are introducing policies to encourage couples to have children (tax reductions, benefits, subsides).
",
15111,1,," at the same time many developing countries are trying to reduce their population growth which results in discouraging having children.
",
15112,1,," for example, china governmental one-child policy means that couples are fined for having more than one child.
",
15113,0,," parenting effectively prevents people from pursuing their own interests and fulfilling their own goals .
",
15114,0,," the child becomes the center and the only valid part of parents ' lives .
",
15115,0,," by having kids , people turn from free individuals into servants .
",
15116,0,," they often have to abandon their careers in order to take care of the offspring .
",
15117,0,," women 's careers are most heavily affected , as women usually end up being the major childcare provider .
",
15118,0,," furthermore , people with children have much less time for socializing resulting in losing friends .
",
15119,0,," couples ' relationships are also bound to deteriorate as mother and father become more interested in a baby than in themselves .
",
15120,0,," it has also been proven that couples with kids engage in sexual activities far less often than those who are childless .
",
15121,0,," all of these reasons contribute to general dissatisfaction of parents who feel they have lost their own lives .
",
15122,0,," as the evidence for that we can quote daniel gilbert , who holds a chair in psychology at harvard .
",
15123,0,," based on his research findings , he reports that childless marriages are far happier .
",
15124,0,," * such a view is supported also by madelyn cain , a teacher at the university of southern california , who says `` statistics show childless couples are happier .
",
15125,0,," their lives are self-directed , they have a better chance of intimacy , and they do not have the stresses , financial and emotional , of parenthood . ''
",
15126,0,," the level of emotional involvement in bringing the child up is immense .
",
15127,0,," parents pour all their souls into children , who , in turn , often leave them disenchanted and exhausted .
",
15128,0,," parents also have to share their child 's problems , fears and traumas , so that the amount of grief that parents take on themselves doubles , or even triples , depending on how troublesome the child is .
",
15129,0,," not only that , but those who have offspring also become more vulnerable .
",
15130,0,," they worry about their kids from the moment they are born until the day they themselves die .
",
15131,0,," parents ' to-worry-about list is endless : from child 's nutrition to summer camps , from accidents to social acceptance , from choosing a school to moving out .
",
15132,0,," having raised children , parents become emotional wrecks .
",
15133,0,," all parents agree that it is emotionally draining and stressful , in, advice columnist ann landers asked her readers , `` if you had it to do over again , would you have children ? ''
",
15134,0,," seventy percent of respondents said `` no . ''
",
15135,0,," for majority of people children are the biggest expenditure they ever undertake .
",
15136,0,," the united states department of agriculture reported inthat the average annual expenses associated with raising a child can be as high as $ 22,960 .
",
15137,0,," * if we assume that a child will live with their parents until the age ofand add average cost of sending a child foryears to college , we arrive at the conclusion that bringing up a child in a developed country costs around $ 500,000 .
",
15138,0,," this money can be far better spent , for instance , on enhancing the standard of education or health care , subsidising economic initiative in developing countries , investing in green technologies , etc, four out of every five children will be born to families whose members survive on less than $a day .
",
15139,0,," around one third of children in developing countries is estimated to be underweight or stunted .
",
15140,0,," * research suggests that even in the usa ,% of children live in poverty .
",
15141,0,," and such an extreme plight of the child is only the beginning .
",
15142,0,," even if a child is born into a relatively well-off family , there are endless devastating situations he has to face during his life : war , death of family members , chronic illness , divorce , crime , and social exclusion .
",
15143,0,," the list can go on and on forever .
",
15144,0,," having children is the equivalent of forcing innocent people , against their will , to experience the misery of life .
",
15145,0,," thus , it is inhumane .
",
15146,0,," the more people consume in the world , the greater the environmental damage .
",
15147,0,," an average american producestons of garbage by the age of.
",
15148,0,," * however , producing extra litter and pollution is not the only hazard that every child poses to the planet .
",
15149,0,," increasing world 's population also places incredible stress on earth 's resources .
",
15150,0,," it is estimated , for instance , that bythree billion people will live in water-scarce countries .
",
15151,0,," by reducing the number of human beings we will manage to avoid numerous overpopulation crises and reverse the damage done to the environment .
",
15152,0,," social and economic inequalities between men and women stem primarily from the fact that women are the child bearers , and mothers overwhelmingly spend more time on childrearing tasks than do their male spouses .
",
15153,0,," not surprisingly then , many employers still discriminate against women when recruiting to work .
",
15154,0,," they view females as those responsible for parenting and thus not reliable , devoted or loyal as employees .
",
15155,0,," even when there is little or no discrimination in recruitment women often hit a ` glass ceiling ' due to breaking their careers in order to have children , in the uk a recent report by the chartered management institute found it would take untilto close the pay gap .
",
15156,0,," * on a social level , not having children will mean more gender equality as there will be no ground for justifying an unequal labour division .
",
15157,1,,"in the 1990s the world band and the imf demanded that developing countries follow structural adjustment programmes to make their economies more market orientated.
",
15158,1,," the resulting change to free market policy brought about changes in the labour market - changes in terms of who is involved in the labour force, what type of employment individuals are able to access, and the degree of risk associated with jobs.
",
15159,1,," loans were made conditional on the implementation of structural adjustment programs (saps)  encouraging neoliberalism, flexibilisation, and a decentralisation in control over the economy.
",
15160,1,," conditions applied affected the lives of inhabitants both in urban and rural economies.
",
15161,1,," today africa’s labour force is continuing to change following the economic crisis.
",
15162,1,,"a feminisation of labour has been occurred in both periodic events.
",
15163,1,," a ‘feminising’ labour force can be referred to in two aspects: firstly, an increase in the number of women being incorporated into paid work.
",
15164,1,," secondly, ‘feminisation’ refers to the increasing flexibilisation of work for both men and women.
",
15165,1,," a shift in the nature of employment is found, with a rise in informal employment and irregular conditions of work.
",
15166,1,," the feminisation of the labour force therefore means changes in the structure of who is employed and the structure of jobs available.
",
15167,1,,"this focuses on labour force participation and empowerment.
",
15168,1,," the world development report (2013) argued jobs are key to development - more jobs are needed and focus should be on getting employment.
",
15169,1,," however, by exploring the picture of female employment and jobs, does work provide empowerment - who is empowered; what kind of empowerment; and fundamentally, how long for?
",
15170,1,," will the convergence, and continued inclusion of women, in employment mean gender differences will disappear in africa’s labour market and society?
",
15171,1,," finally, with women seen to be able to pioneer national development and gdp growth (i.e. barsh and lee, 2011) should we be encouraging more women to enter the labour force?
",
15172,0,," jobs are empowerment .
",
15173,0,," building sustainable livelihoods , and tackling poverty in the long term , requires enabling access to capital assets .
",
15174,0,," a key asset is financial capital .
",
15175,0,," jobs , and employment , provide a means to access and build financial capital required , whether through loans or wages .
",
15176,0,," when a woman is able to work she is therefore able to take control of her own life .
",
15177,0,," additionally she may provide a second wage meaning the burden of poverty on households is cumulatively reduced .
",
15178,0,," having a job and the financial security it brings means that other benefits can be realised such as investing in good healthcare and education , women working from home in kenya , designing jewellery , shows the link between employment and earning an income .
",
15179,0,," the women have been empowered to improve their way of life .
",
15180,0,," unemployment has been linked to several health and wellbeing effects .
",
15181,0,," firstly , the psychological impact of unemployment involve a range of issues - from confidence to mental well-being .
",
15182,0,," issues of mental health problems - such as depression , suicide , anxiety , and substance abuse , need recognition in africa .
",
15183,0,," the impact of mental health may not only be on the individual , but dispersed within families and across generations .
",
15184,0,," secondly , unemployment may result in a loss of social networks and networking skills .
",
15185,0,," the power of social capital , or networks , in reducing vulnerability has been widely noted .
",
15186,0,," therefore encouraging women to participate within the labour market ensures new networks are built and retained through the vital communication skills used .
",
15187,0,," finally .
",
15188,0,," unemployment may affect physical health status .
",
15189,0,," unemployment may place individuals in a downward spiral , making it harder to re-enter the job market .
",
15190,0,," labour participation enables an awareness , and acquirement , of equal gender rights .
",
15191,0,," firstly , labour participation is challenging cultural ideologies and norms of which see the woman 's responsibility as limited to the reproductive sphere .
",
15192,0,," entering the productive sphere brings women equal work rights and the right to enter public space .
",
15193,0,," by such a change gender norms of the male breadwinner are challenged .
",
15194,0,," secondly , labour force participation by women has resulted in the emergence of community lawyers and organisations to represent them .
",
15195,0,," the declaration of the african regional domestic workers network is a case in point .
",
15196,0,," with the rising number of female domestic workers , the network is working to change conditions - upholding conferences , sharing information , and taking action .
",
15197,1,,"despite launching as recently asfacebook has quickly become the biggest social network on the internet.
",
15198,1,," it has more than a billion members of whom half log in daily.
",
15199,1,," it is one of the biggest companies in the world with its market value passing $100 billion in the summer of 2013.
",
15200,1,,"(1) without any doubt, is has had a tremendous effect upon its users, the question is if it’s beneficial or not.
",
15201,1,," proponents argue that it enhances socialization and serves as a platform to spread information among numerous individuals while opponents believe its very existence is detrimental to children making them more prone to anxiety and depression.
",
15202,1,," early in 2013, reports suggested that facebook lost nine million active monthly users in the u.s and two million in britain, showing that many think that facebook now has too much of a negative impact on their lives.
",
15203,0,,"with facebook being the social network of choice for so many and having an immense amount of influence over how we interact the question of whether the social network is beneficial is of vital importance.
",
15204,0,,"one of the most crucial elements in any child 's development is the ability to socialize with peers .
",
15205,0,," by having a large circle of friends to talk to and share interests , the child gains trust , self-esteem and self-confidence .
",
15206,0,," if you have people to talk to when you have a problem , it is much easier to overcome any problems .
",
15207,0,," facebook and social networks in general help teenagers on multiple levels to maintain and expand their circle of friends .
",
15208,0,," firstly , it lets you remain in touch with friends even if you are very far apart .
",
15209,0,," as we live in an increasingly globalized world , friend circles tend to be broken up very easily .
",
15210,0,," as a result , individuals need to be able to keep in touch in spite of the physical distance .
",
15211,0,," facebook enables them to do that .
",
15212,0,,"  secondly , by allowing people with shared opinions , hobbies or interests to gather , social networks allow users to expand their circle of friends , something that is more applicable the bigger the social network .
",
15213,0,," thirdly , it allows young people to spend more time with the friends and people they already know through chat conversations , shared photos or status updates .
",
15214,0,," as a result , people who are engaged on these social networks have more self esteem , more confidence in them , feel more appreciated and tend to be happier in general due to their wide circle of friends .
",
15215,0,,"  undoubtedly , one of the most important aspects which will influence your efforts to improve your life is your ability to take advantage of every opportunity which comes up .
",
15216,0,," obviously , one of the , if not the , best way to do this is to stay connected with the world around you , this enables you to be able to quickly find out about job opportunities , sporting competitions or social events in your area .
",
15217,0,," facebook created and developed an efficient , extremely widely visited platform on which millions of users can get in touch with each other .
",
15218,0,," this can prove to be an extremely useful tool both for companies or event planners and direct customers .
",
15219,0,," no matter if we are talking about google 's new hiring policy or toyota 's new discount , an upcoming music festival or a football tournament for amateur players , facebook is informing the individuals about these events , keeping them connected with their community .
",
15220,0,," social networks are more efficient to serving this purpose than other more conventional means like tv commercials because it is free .
",
15221,0,," a very good example of this is the konycampaign , which informed the people about the atrocities that happened in uganda at the time , mainly relying only on social media .
",
15222,0,," the youtube video telling its story has more thanmillion views and also there were more posts on facebook about kony on march 6th and 7th than even apple 's new ipad or tv releases .
",
15223,0,,"  no matter if we talk about tv ads , radio commercials or billboards , the price that has to be paid in order to promote an event is a big drawback for anyone who wants to inform the population .
",
15224,0,," as a result , facebook as with other social media is the online , cheap , efficient equivalent to an info point .
",
15225,0,," social networks aid our society on multiple levels , one of them being the democratic process .
",
15226,0,," this happens both in autocracies , where the democratic process is basically nonexistent and in western liberal democracies where facebook acts as a megaphone for the will of the population .
",
15227,0,," firstly , when talking about oppressive regimes , facebook allows the population to organize themselves in massive protests which can , in time , overthrow the government .
",
15228,0,," this is of particular importance as the population can not organize protests `` offline '' in the real world , because government forces would quickly find them and stop the protests before they even started .
",
15229,0,," these people need a safe house , where government intervention is minimized , so that they can spread the news and organize the protests .
",
15230,0,," the online environment is the best options .
",
15231,0,," we have seen this happening in the arab spring  , brazil  , turkey  as well as for protests in democracies as in wisconsin  for western liberal democracies too facebook plays a very important role in aiding the democratic process .
",
15232,0,," even in a democracy the government often engages in unpopular policies .
",
15233,0,," unfortunately , as we are talking about countries with tens of millions of people , citizens often feel they ca n't make a difference .
",
15234,0,," luckily , here 's where facebook comes in .
",
15235,0,," it connects all the people who share the same disapproval of government actions , removing the feeling that you can do nothing as there is no one backing you .
",
15236,0,," millions can come together to voice their opinions .
",
15237,0,," therefore there is more likely to be dissent .
",
15238,0,," moreover , the internet allowed individuals to start massive campaigns of online petition gathering , which they will later use as an irrefutable argument to the government showing the desire for change .
",
15239,0,," there are a lot of sites , one of the biggest being avaaz.org which facilitates this process , which use facebook as a medium through which the petition is shared and so grows .
",
15240,1,,"female genital mutilation or fgm is often referred to as 'female circumcision'.
",
15241,1,," it refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural, religious or any other non-medical reasons.
",
15242,1,," four different types of female genital mutilation are known to be performed today, ranging from piercing or stretching of the clitoris and/or labia to their total removal.
",
15243,1,," the most common form of fgm is complete excision of the clitoris and the labia.
",
15244,1,," the most extreme form of fgm, called infibulation, replaces the vulva with a wall of flesh, except for a pencil-size opening1.
",
15245,1,," after excision, the labia are sewn together and the girl's legs are tied together for around two weeks to prevent her from moving.
",
15246,1,,"the majority of females who have undergone fgm are from twenty-eight african countries, found mostly in the band that stretches from senegal in west africa to somalia on the east coast, and from egypt in the north to tanzania in the south.
",
15247,1,," in these regions, it is estimated that more thanmillion girls have undergone this procedure2.
",
15248,1,," however, fgm is also practiced in some parts of asia, the middle east and increasingly by african immigrants living in australia, canada and the usa.
",
15249,1,," as of today, approximatelymillion women have undergone fgm.
",
15250,1,," it is estimated that three million girls each year are likely to be subject to fgm procedures.
",
15251,1,,"even within cultures where fgm is the accepted norm, the procedure, purpose, and typical age at which fgm is performed varies widely.
",
15252,1,," fgm is practiced by followers of a religious belief as well as non-believers, for sociological reasons as well as mythical ones.
",
15253,1,," fgm is usually carried out with crude medical instruments and without anesthetic, but sometimes may be performed in a health care facility with modern medical amenities.
",
15254,1,," fgm can be performed on infants only a few days old, female children or adolescents, or even on mature women3.
",
15255,1,," the average age for the majority of fgm procedures, however, is between four and fifteen years of age.
",
15256,1,,"despite these variations of fgm, the world health organization is universally opposed to medicalization of all types of fgm.
",
15257,1,," most human rights organizations in the western world, africa and asia consider fgm a violation of human rights4.
",
15258,1,," proponents of fgm object to the use of the word ""mutilation"", arguing that it reinforces the idea that this practice is a violation of human rights.
",
15259,1,," they point out that local languages generally use the less judgmental ""cutting"" to describe the procedure.
",
15260,1,," inthe un adopted the term ""cutting"" to avoid demonizing certain cultures, religions and communities, but the practice is still almost universally referred to as ""fgm"".
",
15261,0,," the proposition will need to prove that a ban would be a justified and effective means of protecting women.
",
15262,0,,"global institutions are better equipped to comparatively analyze the facts about fgm and therefore need to prohibit the practice of fgm so that those ignorant to the consequences of the practice will be protected .
",
15263,0,," global organizations are also the only bodies that can ensure that marriage networks give up the practice simultaneously so that no woman is socially handicapped .
",
15264,0,," this process proved successful in china in the early 20th century when the practice of foot binding was rapidly abandoned1 .
",
15265,0,," it requires sufficient funding for large scale education efforts and adequate enforcement , a financial requirement that only these large organizations can meet2 .
",
15266,0,," human rights declarations and treaties , like the un declaration of the rights of the child , which draw upon local cultural and religious notions of common sense , justice and dignity , are often the best way to promote human rights and change the cultural norms that violate them .
",
15267,0,," after all , every country has signed up to these universal standards , and it is our moral duty to enforce them , for example by threatening to withhold aid from states which are not serious about tackling the fgm issue .
",
15268,0,," benin , burkina faso , central african republic , chad , cote d'ivoire , djibouti , egypt , ministerial decree , ghana , guinea , kenya , niger , nigeria , multiple states , senegal , tanzania , togo , australia , belgium , canada , denmark , new zealand , norway , spain , sweden , united kingdom , and the united states have all banned the practice .
",
15269,0,," making this an international policy would support their actions and promote more of the same3 .
",
15270,0,," while many believe that fgm is associated with the tenets of a religion , this is in fact not the case .
",
15271,0,," different religious leaders condone , deem it irrelevant , or discourage it , but there is no one religion that explicitly says fgm is a necessary practice .
",
15272,0,," therefore , banning fgm is not declaring a religion wrong and does not debunk the fundamental beliefs of a group of people .
",
15273,0,," instead , it is competing with a cultural practice that shows a woman 's purity , considered to be harmful to her .
",
15274,0,," cultures change and adapt as they come into modernity -- foot binding is no longer practiced in china , although it was a deep seeded tradition .
",
15275,0,," however , as long as it remains culturally valued for women to be ` cut ' and men only want to marry ` cut ' women the practice will continue .
",
15276,0,," therefore , there needs to be a total ban on the practice so that all women are ` uncut ' otherwise , not undergoing the procedure will continue to carry stigma in some societies .
",
15277,0,," the practice has been replaced within some groups , with one that celebrates and serves the same purpose , but does not involve cutting .
",
15278,0,," fgm is not a necessary part of religion and the fundamental beliefs of the groups that practice it .
",
15279,0,," so , it is not insensitive to ban it .
",
15280,0,," and , a ban is the only way to make being ` uncut ' the norm within these cultures .
",
15281,0,," some rights are inalienable , guaranteed to all human beings and can not be violated with any justification .
",
15282,0,," the right to bodily integrity is perhaps the most fundamental right we enjoy as civilized human beings1 .
",
15283,0,," fgm is a form of illegal body modification and the mutilation of those too young to give their informed consent .
",
15284,0,," most are not given the choice as they would be socially marginalized if they were ` uncut ' .
",
15285,0,," genital mutilation may leave a lasting mark on the life and mind of the woman who has undergone it .
",
15286,0,," in the longer term , women may suffer feelings of incompleteness , anxiety and depression .
",
15287,0,," fgm is also a form of violence against women and a direct expression of patriarchal oppression .
",
15288,0,," fgm has been practiced by some cultures solely in order to maintain the chastity and virginity of a woman before marriage , to ensure fidelity during marriage , and to increase male sexual pleasure2 .
",
15289,0,," fgm additionally violates her right to equal opportunity , to not be discriminated against , to freedom from violence , injury , abuse , torture , cruel or inhuman treatment , protection from harmful traditional practices and the freedom to make reproductive decisions , all of which are protected under international law3 .
",
15290,0,," it takes a woman 's body out of her own control , and ultimately inflicts long term pain and suffering , none of which can be justified .
",
15291,0,," immediate complications of female genital mutilation include severe pain , shock , hemorrhage , urine retention , ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue1 .
",
15292,0,," hemorrhaging and infection can cause death .
",
15293,0,," long-term consequences include cysts and abscesses , keloid scar formation , damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence , dyspareunia , painful sexual intercourse , and sexual dysfunction , as well as difficulties with childbirth2 .
",
15294,0,," more recently , concern has arisen about possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus , hiv , due to the use of a single instrument in multiple operations3 .
",
15295,0,," the fundamental goal of human society is preservation , and it is the responsibility of world-wide organizations to safeguard human sustainability .
",
15296,0,," this goal is compromised in cultures that practice fgm .
",
15297,0,," deliveries to women who have undergone fgm are significantly more likely to be complicated by caesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage , and episiotomy , extended maternal hospital stay , resuscitation of the infant , and inpatient prenatal death , than deliveries to women who have not had fgm .
",
15298,0,," it was estimated in a junewho study thattobabies per thousand births die during delivery as a result of the practice of fgm4 .
",
15299,0,," additionally 25-30 % of women who undergo fgm are left infertile5 .
",
15300,0,," fgm jeopardizes maternal and infant health and therefore can not be justified .
",
15301,0,," the health consequences that it causes mean it should not be allowed to continue .
",
15302,1,,"at present all children born in the usa are automatically made citizens of the united states.
",
15303,1,," this applies even if one or both parents are not themselves us citizens – they could be illegal immigrants, tourists, students, or legal immigrants temporarily working in america.
",
15304,1,," in many other countries birthright citizenship does not exist; babies born in countries such as the uk or japan do not automatically become citizens as their status depends on the citizenship and immigration status of their parents.
",
15305,1,," as the debate over illegal immigration in the usa has gained strength over the past decade, there have been calls to change the us system by removing birthright citizenship.
",
15306,1,," similar debates have occurred in other countries, with ireland voting by referendum to end birthright citizenship in 2005.
",
15307,1,," on the other hand germany used to restrict citizenship to those of german descent, but changed its laws into give citizenship to many children born in germany to parents who were non-citizen “guest-workers” (most turkish in origin).
",
15308,1,,"the debate in the usa is complicated by the origins of birthright citizenship there.
",
15309,1,," the original united states constitution, written in 1787, assumed the concept of citizenship but did not define it.
",
15310,1,," courts at state and federal level (notably lynch v. clarke in 1844) applied the english common law principle of “jus soli” - the idea that you gain citizenship by virtue of your birth in a particular country – rather than “jus sanguinis” (“citizenship of blood”), the alternative concept that a child acquires the status of their parents.
",
15311,1,," however, major exceptions were made for native americans and african-americans; notoriously, in thecase of dred scott vs sandford the us supreme court found that no african-american, whether slave or free, could be a citizen of the united states.
",
15312,1,," this is why after the civil war and the abolition of slavery, the 14th amendment to the constitution was passed in(ratified 1868).
",
15313,1,," this says that “all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside.”
",
15314,1,," because of the 14th amendment it is usually argued that the only way to remove the right of birthright citizenship would be to amend the us constitution.
",
15315,1,," although some republicans are keen to overturn birthright citizenship, the party is not united on this issue and democrats are solidly against the proposal, so a constitutional amendment to this effect is very unlikely to pass.
",
15316,0,," however, some advocates of a change argue that the 14th amendment has been misinterpreted in the past, and that by passing ordinary laws at federal or state level that challenge birthright citizenship, they could force the supreme court to look again at the issue.
",
15317,0,,"the national security of the state depends on shared values , norms and principles , factors that by definition can not be tested and massaged whilst immigrants hide in the shadows and refuse to come forward .
",
15318,0,," birthright citizenship encourages the assimilation of families and cultures as a whole into that of the state , forming not a homogeneity but a comfortable and restrained multiculturalism joined at the core by certain shared principles .
",
15319,0,," as john mccain noted in aspeech , ` we have a national interest in identifying individuals , incentivizing them to come forward out of the shadows ... regularize their status '.
",
15320,0,," therefore , to ensure that state derives the most it can out of its citizens , it is in their interest to give them citizenship at birth rather than turn a blind eye to the illegal underclass .
",
15321,0,," birthright citizenship prevents an increase in the number of illegal residents .
",
15322,0,," as more children of current illegal aliens are denied citizenship , we will be creating a permanent , ` marginalized and undereducated ' underclass with few civil rights , likely to be alienated from our society but knowing no other homeland to which they could return .
",
15323,0,," a recent migration policy institute study found that the removal of birthright citizenship would lead to a% increase in the illegal immigrant community .
",
15324,0,," more illegal immigrants creates a hereditary poverty due to the understandable barriers to entry in the job market for non-citizens .
",
15325,0,," further to that , jared bernstein , a senior economist , argues that illegal immigrants are statistically poorer because they lack access to the economic advantages conferred by citizenship ; ` while 9.8 % of those naturalized are poor , the share for non-citizens is a whopping 21.6 % ' .
",
15326,0,," to increase the amount of illegal immigrants with such statistics in mind would only serve to exacerbate the poverty of such groups and provide a sore for the state as a whole .
",
15327,0,," birthright citizenship has been a critical driver of integration for generations .
",
15328,0,," for newly arrived immigrants , knowing that their children will have full citizenship has encouraged them to work hard , put down roots and invest in their new country .
",
15329,0,," for their citizen children , knowing they have equal opportunities with all other young americans has led them to work hard to achieve their dreams .
",
15330,0,," as tamar jacoby of the manhattan institute argues , ` newcomers put down roots and invest all-out in their lives because they know their children will be guaranteed full membership ' .
",
15331,0,," if birthright citizenship is removed , the process of integration will inevitably stutter .
",
15332,0,," over the years , many children born in america will end up without citizenship anywhere , including a third generation that has no links to any other state .
",
15333,0,," removing birthright citizenship will involve costly unintended consequences .
",
15334,0,," a huge new federal bureaucracy will be needed to keep track of millions of residents who lack citizenship , but who can not be deported because they have no citizenship elsewhere either .
",
15335,0,," as tamar jacoby points out ` these young people know no other home , many will never learn the language of their parents , and very few will even consider going back to the old country ' .
",
15336,0,," it will be , as legal expert margaret stick notes , ' a bureaucratic nightmare ' requiring the hiring of ` thousands of lawyers to adjudicate people 's applications and figure out whether they are citizens or not ' .
",
15337,0,," furthermore , it may have wider effects in society .
",
15338,0,," in the united states for example , ` the vast majority of people prove their citizenship through a birth certificate , and if that is no longer considered proof that you are an american citizen , they are going to have to come up with something else ' .
",
15339,0,," in summary therefore , the costs of the removal of the birthright citizenship far exceed the likely benefits .
",
15340,0,," a child has no choice where it is born , and the child of non-citizen parents should be recognized as a citizen just as much as the child born to those who can trace their citizenship back through many generations .
",
15341,0,," the united states is famously a nation of immigrants , welcoming `` huddled masses yearning to breathe free '' on the statue of liberty .
",
15342,0,," unlike germany or japan , where ethnicity has traditionally been the criteria for citizenship , the usa is a melting-pot , uniting people of diverse origins under one flag .
",
15343,0,," throughout us history the children of non-citizens have been accepted as true americans , paying taxes , being drafted and fighting for the flag in wartime , and being elected to office .
",
15344,0,," as enshrined in the 14th amendment of the u.s. constitution , ` all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the united states ' .
",
15345,0,," this is what america stands for , what made the nation great ; it is a proud history which should not be rejected .
",
15346,1,,"lgbt (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender), same-sex, or gay (for short) adoption is the adoption of children by lgbt parents, either individually, or as a couple.
",
15347,1,," lgbt adoption is a complex legal issue, involving several considerations.
",
15348,1,,"states in the world have laws on the books specifically giving gay couples the right to adopt.
",
15349,1,," several other states have jurisdictions where same-sex couples are legally allowed to adopt, while not having a national law on the issue.
",
15350,1,," for example, several states in the us allow gay couples to adopt, a few specifically prohibit it, and the rest have no specific right or prohibition against it.
",
15351,1,," but there is no federal (nation-wide) law settling the issue for all states.
",
15352,1,," a few other countries, like finland and iceland, allow one partner in a same-sex union to adopt the other's biological child.
",
15353,1,," this is especially relevant for lesbian couples where one partner gives birth to the child, gay male couples who use a surrogate with the sperm of one of the partners, and individuals who enter a gay relationship after having or adopting children in a hetereosexual relationship (essentially same-sex step-parent rights).
",
15354,1,," in other countries, gay people may petition individually to adopt, while gay couples cannot.
",
15355,1,," the majority of countries in the world, though, have laws specifically prohibiting adoption by gay couples.
",
15356,1,," in others, like the majority of african states, being gay is in itself illegal, so the point of adoption is moot.
",
15357,1,," many gay and lesbian couples emigrate from countries where it may be unsafe for same-sex couples to raise a family to those which allow for gay marraige and adoption.
",
15358,1,," given the multitude of scenarios this debate can cover, it is useful to restrict it to a specific case.
",
15359,0,," the debate usually focuses on the right of gay couples, rather than individuals to adopt children.
",
15360,0,,"there are still many ways for gay people to become parents .
",
15361,0,," some of them are able to pay for a surrogate ; some may have a natural child from a previous , heterosexual , relationship and then raise the child with a gay partner .
",
15362,0,," in effect , what this law does is make it impossible for two gay people to have legal rights over a child they may already be raising together .
",
15363,0,," these kids deserve the security of two legally recognized parents .
",
15364,0,," if being raised by gay parents is really that harmful , why would the law allow two gay people to raise a child together as parents but refuse to legally recognize them as such ?
",
15365,0,," the overwhelming majority of scientific studies on this issue have convincingly shown that children raised by gay couples are certainly not worse off than those raised by straight parents1 .
",
15366,0,," some studies have gone as far as to demand that in the face of this evidence , gay bans be ended2 .
",
15367,0,," based on the robust nature of the evidence available , the courts in florida were satisfied inthat the issue is beyond dispute and they struck down the ban3 .
",
15368,0,," when there is n't any scientific evidence to support the differential treatment of one group , it is only based on prejudice and bigotry , which should have no place in a democratic society .
",
15369,0,," discrimination is the practice of treating people differently based not on individual merit but on their membership to a certain group .
",
15370,0,," the adoption bans are a clear example .
",
15371,0,," rather than assessing gay couples individually , it is simply assumed that they would all make bad parents because they are gay , while straight couples are assessed based on their individual merit .
",
15372,0,," this breaches the fundamental right of all people to be treated equally under the law and it should be stopped .
",
15373,0,," this principle is enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights ; article`` all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights .
",
15374,0,," ``and also many other national and regional legal texts , e.g, the us constitution ,2 the european convention on human rights .
",
15375,0,," getting married and raising a family is considered in most societies one of the most important and fulfilling experiences one can aspire to .
",
15376,0,," it is so important it is considered a human right , articleof the european convention on human rights states `` everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence .
",
15377,0,," ``, it is considered so important for people to be able to become parents that some governments , the uk , for example , fund fertility treatments for couples who are reproductively challenged , and a majority of the population supports that policy2 .
",
15378,0,," but members of the lgbt community are stopped from pursuing this human right by repressive and discriminatory laws .
",
15379,1,,"the exchange of personal sexual services for economic rewards has a long history.
",
15380,1,," it is important to distinguish different kinds of markets in sexual services in order to determine the appropriate societal response.
",
15381,1,," for example, markets in sexual services that involve coerced sex, children, fraud and deception, and, in general, non-consensual and egregiously exploitative sexual or labor practices, are immoral and should be restricted.
",
15382,1,," theorists often use the terms “human trafficking,” “sex trafficking,” or “sexual slavery” to describe such practices, and the service providers in these practices have the status of a victim or slave.
",
15383,1,,"there are markets in sexual services that do not appear to involve forced labor or sex, and in which the workers seem reasonably well compensated.
",
15384,1,," debates over prostitution often focus on the issue of whether genuinely voluntary markets can exist or whether markets in sexual services are inherently coercive, oppressive, and harmful to the individuals who participate, as well as to non-involved third parties.
",
15385,1,,"prostitutes are highly stigmatized for the work they do, and those who condemn this work believe that it is shameful and immoral, and has no place in a just social order.
",
15386,1,," others believe it is a necessary evil, in that if men (primarily) could not satisfy their sexual urges through some form of commoditized sexual service, these urges would find a more socially disruptive outlet.
",
15387,1,,"  some feminists argue that prostitution is a relic from older patriarchal societies in which men’s access to the bodies of subordinates was a privilege and expression of men’s social power.
",
15388,1,," many contemporary “sex workers” (a term coined by prostitutes’ rights activists) report that their clients have various motives, but primarily to seek relief from loneliness or to have uncomplicated sex.
",
15389,1,," these sex workers believe that they are providing a valuable and morally permissible service to their clients and, by earning a living doing valuable work, they are making a contribution to their societies.
",
15390,1,," in short, women (and men) who offer their labor in various types of sex trades believe that the stigma that attaches to them and their work is unfair and undeserved.
",
15391,1,,"the appropriate societal response to human trafficking and slavery is abolition.
",
15392,1,," the abolitionist approach criminalizes only the activities of the client and others who profit from sex trafficking, but not the provider of sexual services.
",
15393,1,," providers are treated as victims whom others exploit by luring them into sex trades.
",
15394,1,," for sex markets not involving forced labor or sex, there are three standard approaches: prohibition, legalisation, and decriminalisation.
",
15395,1,," the prohibitionist approach criminalizes the activities of the provider, client, and other persons who profit from sex market transactions.
",
15396,1,," the legalization approach tolerates sex markets and businesses, but restricts them in ways that are specific to this industry.
",
15397,1,," regulations may include mandatory std testing or condom use, zoning restrictions, special licencing requirements for businesses, government registration of workers, restrictions on advertising, and minimum age restrictions for providers and customers.
",
15398,1,," the decriminalization approach seeks to remove both criminal and special regulatory restrictions and to regulate markets in sex in ways that are common for non-sex businesses.
",
15399,1,,"the abolitionist approach collapses sex trafficking and prostitution together, as proponents generally believe that few workers enter sex markets voluntarily, and those who do are not acting in their best interest.
",
15400,1,,"  the decriminalization approach typically recognizes the need for some special regulation (at least those appropriate to adult businesses, such as liquor stores), but proponents often oppose the regulatory schemes currently in use (especially, registration and mandatory health exams for workers).
",
15401,1,,"  for the sake of argument, this debate assumes that some service providers enter sex markets voluntarily and with a rational assessment of their interests, and that some special regulation is necessary even if we have not yet come up with the best scheme.
",
15402,0,,"  therefore this debate will focus on legalization verses prohibition.
",
15403,0,,"criminalizing the acts of selling and buying sexual services does not protect those who sell or buy such services , but rather pushes these activities underground .
",
15404,0,," while market exchanges of sexual services involve some risk-taking , the risks are increased and compounded when such markets are prohibited .
",
15405,0,," when selling and buying sex is illegal , those participating in these exchanges can not , or simply do not , seek the protection of the law when their rights are violated .
",
15406,0,," because crimes against sex workers or their clients are often unreported , and when reported often not investigated , predators and rights violators can take advantage of others without fear of arrest and punishment .
",
15407,0,," moreover , because criminalization forces sex work into remote and invisible corners of society , sellers and buyers are less able to insure their safety and protection .
",
15408,0,," for these reasons , laws criminalizing sex markets amplify the risks sellers and buyers face when they participate in sex market transactions .
",
15409,0,," the main purpose of criminalizing sex markets is to protect those who enter such markets from harm .
",
15410,0,," yet the harms of paying or accepting money for a good that can be legally exchanged for free are far less than the harms that result from the rights violations that often occur , robbery , battery , sexual assault , murder , when sex markets are pushed underground .
",
15411,0,," while many societies have attempted to restrict sex to marriage , few , if any , have succeeded .
",
15412,0,," in contemporary , secular liberal societies , adults are no longer punished for pursuing sex outside of marriage .
",
15413,0,," many adults find non-marital sex satisfying , healthy , and fulfilling , whether it occurs in the context of an ongoing romantic relationship , a casual friendship , or a market exchange .
",
15414,0,," while many people will never seek the services of a sex worker , those who do are often seeking sensual comfort , companionship , entertainment , and fantasy fulfilment .
",
15415,0,," while the latter goods are often obtainable in non-market relationships , some people prefer the convenience and efficiency of market mechanisms for securing these goods .
",
15416,0,," in a liberal society , individuals are free to pursue their own vision of happiness , as long as they respect the moral and civil rights of others .
",
15417,0,," markets that provide sexual services enable some individuals to secure goods essential to their happiness .
",
15418,0,," those who provide services to these individuals can do so in a manner that respects their rights and dignity , if the markets are legal and well regulated .
",
15419,0,," sexual autonomy means being able to control when , where , and with whom one has sexual relations .
",
15420,0,," it also means that , at any moment , one may withdraw from a sexual relationship or encounter .
",
15421,0,," spouses , lovers , and also strangers have the right to sexual autonomy .
",
15422,0,," if an adult chooses to engage in sex with other adults who offer material benefits , her right to sexual autonomy is respected as long as she has control over when , where , and with which clients she has sexual relations , and as long as she is mentally competent and is allowed to terminate the agreement at any time .
",
15423,0,," if markets in sex were to become legal , the rights of providers , and clients , to sexual autonomy would need to be respected .
",
15424,0,," this means that sex workers would maintain the right to refuse service to any customer , and to discontinue service or employment at any time and for any reason .
",
15425,0,," like other workers , sexual service providers would have the right to a safe and healthy work place .
",
15426,0,," workers who are drug dependent , or otherwise incompetent or highly vulnerable in the work place , would need to be provided treatment and time off work until they were capable of protecting themselves and others .
",
15427,0,," removing criminal penalties from the sale or purchase of sexual services , and regulating sex markets so that they protect participants and non-involved third parties , would be socially beneficial .
",
15428,0,," in particular , sex enterprises and businesses could be made safer for workers , clients , and the communities in which they operated .
",
15429,0,," by allowing sex businesses to operate openly , providers , clients , and business owners can become law-abiding , productive citizens , who contribute to their communities .
",
15430,0,," sex businesses and workers would pay taxes , and other licensing fees .
",
15431,0,," business owners would be expected to comply with standard business laws and regulations .
",
15432,0,," moreover , the government could enact special regulations appropriate to this industry , such as age restrictions on workers and clients , and mandatory condom use .
",
15433,0,," the resources that are currently allocated to arrest , prosecute , and incarcerate sex workers and clients could be reallocated for better uses .
",
15434,0,," for example , these resources could be used to better address the sexual abuse of minors , sexual assault , substance abuse , mental health problems , and the many public and individual needs that go unmet .
",
15435,0,," some markets in sex should be blocked .
",
15436,0,," markets that involve child labor , forced labor or sex , and forced migration and detention , should be stopped and those who organize and profit from such markets should be prosecuted .
",
15437,0,," as with any service , it is critically important that no one is forced to work or to continue working , either through the threat of harm or through fraud and deception .
",
15438,0,," it is also critically important that children are protected from sexual predators , and are excluded from all aspects of sex businesses .
",
15439,0,," forced labor and child sexual abuse involve violations of basic human rights that all societies are expected to protect .
",
15440,0,," voluntary , adult sex work is significantly different from trafficking , and law enforcers need to distinguish market exchanges involving consensual sex among adults from market exchanges involving forced sex among adults or involving minors .
",
15441,0,," by legalizing voluntary , adult sex work , law enforcers and rights protectors could focus their efforts on eliminating markets that involve the sexual abuse of adults or children .
",
15442,0,," additionally , clients of sex business would have the choice of patronizing legal business , and therefore would be less likely to patronize inadvertently a business that relies on forced or child labor .
",
15443,1,,"sponsoring a child is a popular way of supporting charity work in the developing world - countries where people don’t have much money.
",
15444,1,," many charities run schemes which link a person in a more wealthy country (the donor, or sponsor) with a particular child in a developing country.
",
15445,1,," the sponsor gives a little bit of money (a donation) every month to support that child, it’s usually between $20 and $40[1].
",
15446,1,," some charities focus their sponsorship work on orphans, but most choose children living at home with their families, and the money is often spent by the charity rather than given directly to the child’s family.
",
15447,1,," usually the child benefits through education, health care, and perhaps food aid.
",
15448,1,," some charities use the sponsored children as a way of assisting a whole community, while others focus more on the individual child and their family.communication is an important part of sponsorship schemes.
",
15449,1,," as well as their regular donations, sponsors usually send letters to the child they are supporting, and perhaps occasional gifts.
",
15450,1,," in return they can expect to receive regular reports and photographs from the charity about the child’s progress and how their money is making a difference to his or her life.
",
15451,1,," often the child is also expected to write to their sponsor, if they are able to do so.
",
15452,1,,"although sponsorship is a major source of funding for charities working overseas, it does have critics.
",
15453,1,," most of the largest aid agencies choose not to offer child sponsorship schemes, this discussion looks at why that is, and whether or not sponsorship is a good form of charitable giving.
",
15454,0,," over the years $a month , or perhaps even more , adds up to thousands of dollars ' worth of aid spending - this is different to other forms of charity because the main focus here is on `` long-term changes ''  .
",
15455,0,," unlike a one-off donation , this method of giving ensures that poor people get support for a long time without costing people too much in one go .
",
15456,0,," it also ensures that people keep giving to these needy causes , and makes people realise that they can afford to make a difference .
",
15457,0,," personal letters , charity reports , photographs and even visits help to build a bridge between the developed and developing world  .
",
15458,0,," more and more people are able to talk to each other around the world , and it is important that less fortunate people in poor countries are connected to the rest of us and have the opportunity to communicate with us .
",
15459,0,," sponsorship creates a personal connection - the children get to learn about their sponsors and the sponsors get to learn how their money helps people .
",
15460,0,," this continued attention to the positive effects of sponsorship is really important to help poorer countries , especially at a time when worldwide economics are in trouble and charities are most at risk from begin forgotten  .
",
15461,0,," this includes drinking water , food , education , medical care , shelter and sanitation - often charitable donations are more specific , they only provide for one of these aspects of life .
",
15462,0,," by putting children at the heart of charity programs it is hoped that a stronger foundation will be made for the future - the young people who are helped today can maintain a better lifestyle in the future  .
",
15463,0,," giving all this to an individual child also produces more tangible results than giving to a vast organisation , whose work is can often over-ambitious and more open to corruption  .
",
15464,0,," unlike most other forms of charity , sponsorship creates a direct link between the person giving money and the person receiving it .
",
15465,0,," people are able to see the ways in which their money is helping others , and this makes them feel good about it -- as world vision international says - `` you get to see and feel the difference your support makes ''  .
",
15466,0,," although this is probably not the best reason for people to give their money to those in need , practically speaking , in the real world , it is one of the most effective , it works very well , in encouraging people to give .
",
15467,1,,"    despite enhanced access to education and political participation, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions worldwide.
",
15468,1,," the gender inequality in representation is often explained through historical, cultural, socioeconomic, and institutional factors affecting women’s status.
",
15469,1,," in 2013, the business world has only two female chief executives in the ftse 100.
",
15470,1,," the introduction of gender quotas is an effort to close the participatory gap between genders.
",
15471,1,," both those in favour and against quotas link their arguments to the effects on the economic factors.
",
15472,1,,"  the latest example takes place in the european union (eu) where the voluntary self-regulation aiming at gender equality in boardrooms did not change the status quo and women still account for only 13.5 per cent of board members in large public companies.
",
15473,1,," this failure resulted in a proposal from the eu commission that will require national governments to impose penalties, such as fines or a loss of government contracts, when more thanper cent of a firm’s non-executive directors are of the same gender in 2020.
",
15474,1,," state-owned companies will have to meet the requirement by 2018.
",
15475,1,," the written style of the proposal ensures that men are likewise not negatively affected by gender imbalance.
",
15476,1,," it would introduce reporting requirements for any company in which fewer than two out of five posts on the corporate board were held by women or men.
",
15477,1,," in those cases, the companies would have to prove candidates for board positions had been chosen purely on the basis of experience.
",
15478,1,," in situations where finalists had the same level of experience, the post would have to go to the candidate from the gender underrepresented on the board -- in most cases to a woman.
",
15479,1,,"    this requires some definitions.
",
15480,1,," this discussion interprets ‘gender quotas’ as a set minimum of reserved places for women in business institutions that could be constitutional and/or legislative or voluntary.
",
15481,1,," by ‘advantageous’, the proposition argues that gender quotas stimulate, support, or foster an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, compared to the period prior to their introduction.
",
15482,0,," gender equality at the workplace is an important principle that businesses should follow .
",
15483,0,," if we consider men and women to be equal then they should be equally represented at the top levels of politics , society , and business .
",
15484,0,," this is not simply a national issue , but a pan-eu problem of justice and equal rights .
",
15485,0,," gender equality is linked to the fundamental human rights that the eu endorses and the lack of progress in terms of women in high positions of europe requires a proactive stance .
",
15486,0,," as morin-chartier argues , the eu directives are about being a model for one another and the quotas will serve as an archetype for others worldwide .
",
15487,0,," therefore , the quotas are necessary to encourage progress in this field as other tools have not brought equal gender representation .
",
15488,0,," by introducing gender quotas to ensure gender equality , one could not only increase the labour force by bringing more women but also enhance the labour productivity and the available talent pool in a country .
",
15489,0,," this would stimulate businesses to expand , innovate , and compete .
",
15490,0,," this process has an effect of raising tax revenue and social security payments .
",
15491,0,," the overall effect is the positive growth of the economy .
",
15492,0,," therefore , addressing social injustice and higher economic returns are mutually supportive goals .
",
15493,0,," this argument is particularly relevant for qualified women who could be hired at executive positions , but are prevented from doing so due to cultural beliefs , societal practices , and lack of economic and institutional support .
",
15494,0,," a study by asa löfström on the links between economic growth and productivity in the labour market argues that if women 's productivity level rises to the level of men 's , europe 's gdp could grow% which makes women 's participation is of crucial importance to europe 's economy .
",
15495,0,," quotas would allow for a better utilisation of the talent pool ; as currently ,% of the students graduating from europe 's higher educational institutes are women .
",
15496,0,," with the current access to education and the introduction of quotas against barriers of existing prejudices , women will have incentives and support to increase their productivity in the case of norway , the quota law requires all public , state-owned , municipal , inter-municipal and cooperative companies to appoint at least% women on their boards per.
",
15497,0,," the law led to a fast increase from% women on boards of public limited companies into 36 % in.
",
15498,0,," quotas attempting to maximise the number of educated and skilled women in executive positions could improve corporate performance and help raise national productivity .
",
15499,0,," but doing so will depend on keeping ambitious , well-qualified women moving up the management ranks .
",
15500,0,," gender quotas will encourage more women to pursue education and career options leading to the top of executive positions .
",
15501,0,," quotas create incentives for women to adapt their job preferences to the more accessible boardroom positions and develop necessary skills which would reduce the need for positive discrimination in the future .
",
15502,0,," encouraged to develop relevant skills , women will contribute to the long-term talent pool and the economy .
",
15503,0,," according to mckinsey report , women 's interest in being leaders increases as they progress from entry level to middle management which is exactly what the principle behind quotas aims to encourage - more women following professional career development .
",
15504,0,," this is very important in the short run during which , according to research , women who have high position stimulate other women 's interest in traditionally male-dominated sectors and encourage them to pursue similar career paths .
",
15505,0,," there are many reports showing that there is a positive correlation between the number of women on high positions and the companies ' performance .
",
15506,0,," a report from the mckinsey organizational health index , ohi , argues that companies with three or more women in top positions , executive committee and higher , scored higher than their peers .
",
15507,0,," companies that score highly on all the ohi measures have also shown superior financial performance .
",
15508,0,," this is often related to the high overall education level of women on boards .
",
15509,0,," in norway , there has been some advancement in firms ' human capital as a result of the quotas , which may result in increased profits in the future due to the increasing number of well educated women .
",
15510,0,," female managers tend to promote a communal and collaborative style of leadership that can improve a company 's performance and work culture .
",
15511,0,," organizations with women in top leadership positions are also more likely to provide work-life assistance to all employees .
",
15512,0,," norwegian scholars have found that the increased number of women on boards has led to more focused and strategic decision-making , increased communication , and decreased conflict .
",
15513,0,," in fact , many successful business women , such as sheryl sandberg , also argue that more women in business could change business ethics and the male-associated image of successful business model that will bring competitive advantages to companies and thus , to the eu economies .
",
15514,1,,"feminism is relatively difficult to define, both because of the breadth of the movement, which includes a wide diversity of views and some vigorous internal debate, and because it is so frequently caricatured by its opponents.
",
15515,1,," a fair description might be that it is a movement committed to the pursuit of equality, notably but not exclusively sexual equality.
",
15516,1,," it is based on an analysis of inequality rooted in the social transformation of sex (the real, biological differences between men and women) into gender (the various ways in which men and women are perceived as having different abilities and social roles), and the ways in which gender is implicated in unequal power relationships between men and women in many areas of life.
",
15517,1,,"feminism assumes that such treatment is cultural and thus possible to change and not simply ""the way the world is and must be"".
",
15518,1,," feminism looks to a different culture as possible, and values moving towards that culture.
",
15519,1,," it consists of activism, individually and in groups, to make personal and social change towards that more desirable culture.
",
15520,1,," important topics for feminist theory and politics include: the body, class and work, disability, the family, globalization, human rights, popular culture, race and racism, reproduction, science, the self, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality.
",
15521,1,,"for years women have fought for their rights.
",
15522,1,," once women gained rights in society (including the right to vote invia the representation of the people act 1928, in america inwith the passage of the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution and in australia in 1902) they were no longer willing to be treated as second class citizens in the home or in the work place.
",
15523,1,," but almost a century later has this feminist movement achieved its end goal of complete equality, or are there still battles to be fought by the feminist movement?
",
15524,0,," feminism is still of relevance today , and is indeed needed .
",
15525,0,," in the uk , one in four women suffers domestic violence , and an increase in the reporting of rape in the last thirty years has gone alongside a threefold drop in conviction rates .
",
15526,0,," in countries such as ireland and malta abortion is still not legal for all women , this can be seen as an important part of equality for woman that has not been achieved yet and needs to be fought for .
",
15527,0,," if we take feminism as a global movement then the movement is still of huge importance .
",
15528,0,," that 's because u.s. women still earned onlycents on the male dollar in, according to the latest census statistics .
",
15529,0,," , that number drops to% for african-american women and% for latinas .
",
15530,0,," , these are all real problems , on which feminists continue to campaign - as they should .
",
15531,0,," out of overcountries , only a few are currently headed by women .
",
15532,0,," women still account for only about% of members of parliament worldwide in.
",
15533,0,," some argue that gender quotas should be established to ensure equal input of men and women in parliament .
",
15534,0,," therefore , the feminist movement is still needed to fight this battle .
",
15535,0,," woman still hold lower position in business , the legal profession and in the world of politics .
",
15536,0,," it is therefore hard to argue that the glass ceiling has disintegrated .
",
15537,0,," until women hold higher positions in these fields the feminist cause has still not achieved its goals - in seeking to create a world where , amongst other things women can advance up the ladder in their career without being blocked by a glass ceiling and held back in lower positions .
",
15538,0,," employers worry when they hire young/middle aged women .
",
15539,0,," they fear that after hiring a woman , she will only cost the company money by getting pregnant and going on maternity leave .
",
15540,0,," to combat this attitude , maternity and paternity leave should be equal .
",
15541,0,," currently , paternity leave is a maximum of two consecutive weeks .
",
15542,0,," these two weeks must be taken withindays of the child 's birth .
",
15543,0,," this can be contrasted with the long maternity leave that is allowed for .
",
15544,0,," women are entitled toweeks of maternity leave from day one of employment .
",
15545,0,," women are entitled to maternity pay forweeks if they have been working for their employer forweeks .
",
15546,0,," father 's also do not have the right to take time off work to attend antenatal classes , this allowance is for pregnant employees only .
",
15547,0,," the feminist cause still has this issue to resolve .
",
15548,0,," until paternity leave is offered an employer can safely assume that a woman will be the partner to burden the care of the child and the employer will be the one to bear these costs of maternity leave .
",
15549,0,," this gives men an unfair advantage in the workplace as they are a `` safer bet '' for employment .
",
15550,1,,"sincethe people’s republic of china has pursued a population control policy that limits all families in china’s largest provinces (with some exceptions), to no more than one child.
",
15551,1,," the chinese government introduced the policy to alleviate social and environmental problems that it had determined to be a result of over population.
",
15552,1,," the policy is controversial both within and outside china for a variety of reasons.
",
15553,1,,"many consider child-birth to be a sacred, inalienable right of citizens.
",
15554,1,," others worry about the economic and social consequences of a policy that will create a more aged population.
",
15555,1,," the policy is enforced at the provincial level through fines that are imposed based on the income of the family and other factors.
",
15556,1,," however, there are still many citizens that continue to have more than one child.
",
15557,1,," in april of 2010, a new chinese census showed that the population, the world's largest, rose to 1.34 billion as of last year, from 1.27 billion in 2000.
",
15558,1,," this put its average annual growth at 0.57% over the decade, down from 1.07 per cent in 1990-2000.
",
15559,1,," it also showed that people over the age ofnow account for 13.3 per cent of china's population, compared to 10.3% in 2000.
",
15560,1,," its reserve of future workers also dwindled; with people undernow make up 16.6% of the population, down from 23%years ago.
",
15561,0,," all of this sparked renewed  subject.11 page, jeremy, “china’s one-child plan faces new fire”, the wall street journal,april 2011, the one child policy is often strictly enforced in china and many parents are given information about contraception to prevent any chance of an unplanned pregnancy .
",
15562,0,," however a large number of pregnancies - within any population - are inevitable , despite the precautions that parents may take .
",
15563,0,," whether as a result of defective medication , irresponsible behaviour , or simple bad luck , sufficiently frequent sexual activity will always lead to pregnancy .
",
15564,0,," reports from human rights workers indicate that the chinese states deals with such eventualities by forcing women to have abortions against their will .
",
15565,0,," by some accounts , the state directly detains and punishes women who resist family planning policies .1 the psychological trauma caused by this is almost indescribable .
",
15566,0,," not only does a forced abortion represent a significant attack on a woman 's bodily autonomy , procedures of this type are officially contextualised as correcting the results of wrongdoing .
",
15567,0,," the woman is not counselled or assured that she is not morally culpable for her actions ; she is placed in a position where the destruction of her foetus is portrayed as the inevitable result of her own lack of responsibility .
",
15568,0,," chinese women are made to feel directly responsible for the loss of their unborn children or for the circumstances that gave rise to their pregnancy .
",
15569,0,," further the chinese authorities often force people to be sterilised against their will .
",
15570,0,," this has happened in some cases almost immediately after birth , which is incredibly traumatic for the people involved .
",
15571,0,," further , should these people ever leave china it prevents them from raising a family in the future with more than a single child .
",
15572,0,," again , forced sterilisation in this way causes large psychological harms due to the manner in which the person 's body is violated .2 many asian cultures have a preference for sons over daughters due to traditions involving inheritance .
",
15573,0,," further , in rural communities a son is often preferable to a daughter simply because of the amount of work that they can do for the family .
",
15574,0,," as well as this , sons act as primary caregivers for the parents when they go into retirement and the son 's parents are often treated better than the daughter 's .
",
15575,0,," it is for these reasons that often when a chinese family finds out that they are set to have a daughter they attempt to selectively abort it and try again for a son .
",
15576,0,," this is technically illegal in china , however , this has only led to back alley abortions which often carry a much higher chance of mortality for the mother .
",
15577,0,," further , it has also led to parents abandoning female children or leaving them to starve so that they may try again with a son .
",
15578,0,," in china 's rural provinces it is much more difficult for the authorities to deal with every case given the sheer number of people over such a large area and as such these crimes often go unprosecuted or punished .
",
15579,0,," this process not only leads to human rights violations , as mentioned , but it also skews the gender balance of the chinese population .
",
15580,0,," specifically , since the implementation of the policy inmany men are finding there are simply no women to marry .
",
15581,0,," byit is estimated there will bemillion men unable to marry in china simply because of the lack of females .1 the one child policy is a policy that can be ignored fairly easily by richer people within china .
",
15582,0,," through their ability to bribe officials as well as their ability to hide extra children using foster parents and the like , it is easily possible for richer people to flout the one child policy .
",
15583,0,," this has shown itself in the form of many wealthy chinese officials , entrepreneurs and celebrities who have been caught ignoring the one child policy .
",
15584,0,," for example betweenand1968 government officials in hunan violated the one child policy .1 given that this is true , the one child policy serves to create social division in china .
",
15585,0,," it is perceived by the poorest chinese communities as an obstacle to prosperity .
",
15586,0,," by imposing harsh penalties , both moral and fiscal , on parents who attempt to maximise not only their future welfare , but also their family 's economic prosperity by trying for a son , the one child policy undermines social development within china 's rural and working classes .
",
15587,0,," moreover , it serves to entrench negative perceptions of chinese officials and business owners as corrupt tyrants .
",
15588,0,," how else will marginalised communities relate to a law that undermines the cohesion of their families and that the wealthy can exempt themselves from ?
",
15589,0,," 2 ibid
",
15590,1,,"asylum is “protection from arrest and extradition given especially to political refugees by a nation or by an embassy or other agency enjoying diplomatic immunity.”
",
15591,1,," asylum can be best understood as protection a country grants an individual by means of granting them ‘refugee’ status and allowing them to live in their country without fear of persecution or prosecution from their home country.
",
15592,1,," asylum is granted in cases where there is a reasonable and immediate threat of what is deemed “unjust” harm or punishment by the receiving country if the individual being granted asylum were to return to their home country.
",
15593,1,," the origin of the concept of asylum is rooted in theconvention relating to the status of refugees and theprotocol relating to the status of refugees.
",
15594,1,," these international conventions were further supported by resolution(xxi) adopted by the united nations general assembly.
",
15595,1,," the international organization that provides administrative and institutional support to asylum-seekers is the united nations high commissioner for refugees.
",
15596,1,,"mirroring a growing acceptance of difference in sexual orientation seen in most western liberal democracies is a continued and violent lack of acceptance of “taboo” sexual practices in less socially-progressive areas of the world.
",
15597,1,," homosexuality, bisexuality and transgendered peoples are common targets of violence and hatred in much of the developing world.
",
15598,1,," in many parts of the world homosexuality is criminalized and even carries the death penalty as punishment in many countries.
",
15599,1,," early maysaw uganda’s parliament attempt to back a bill that would make the crime of homosexuality punishable by death.
",
15600,1,," much of the world is an unsafe place for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (lgbt) peoples and the discussion of asylum is centred on how to appropriately address this issue.
",
15601,0,," the lgbt community fulfills the most basic principles and purposes of the concept of asylum .
",
15602,0,," asylum was created as a direct protection of articleof the united nations declaration of human rights , undhr ,which states that `` everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . ''
",
15603,0,," this article was created in order to protect the third article of the declaration `` everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person . ''
",
15604,0,," this concept of asylum was created to develop a separate category of migration that would allow its applicants to breach normal immigration protocol and application procedures on the basis that these people were in immediate danger and that without creating a specific bypass for them , they would endure great harm or death .
",
15605,0,," the point of asylum as a specific and emergency measure and , indeed a moral necessity , was two-fold : 1 , the immediate nature of the threat/danger to their person 2 , that this threat was persecutory in nature what is important to note is that `` persecution '' is fundamentally different than prosecution .
",
15606,0,," the difference lay in the acceptability and justice of the punishment someone may or will endure .
",
15607,0,," persecution is a term used for a punishment that is unjust or morally abhorrent .
",
15608,0,," asylum has emerged as a category of protection we grant to people who we believe that we are morally obligated to help , because if we do not , they will receive a punishment they do not deserve and will severely harmed for something they deserve no harm for .
",
15609,0,," we , the proposition , believe that both of these criteria are filled by those fleeing persecution for sexual orientation and thus we are morally-obligated to grant them asylum .
",
15610,0,," first , it is clear that they are facing immediate danger .
",
15611,0,," whether it is death penalties in places like uganda or vigilante justice against homosexuals such as the murder of david kato .
",
15612,0,," in places like uganda , local tabloids often publishes `` gay lists '' of individuals they believe are gay so that the community can track them down and kill them for their sexual orientation , which is how and why david kato was murdered .
",
15613,0,," it is clear that whether by the state or by their neighbour , there is a clear and immediate danger to many lgbt people across the world .
",
15614,0,," the second criteria of the unacceptability of this persecution is also clear .
",
15615,0,," we as western liberal democracies have in recent years become increasingly accepting of the lgbt community with the granting of gay marriage , application of anti-discrimination laws and even allowing of gay-adoption in many countries .
",
15616,0,," the sexual orientation of an individual is in no indicative of one 's worth as a human being in the eyes of the western liberal democracy and can never possible be a death sentence .
",
15617,0,," it is inconceivable for us to consider sexual orientation a reason to not allow a person to raise a child , never mind view it as an acceptable reason for death .
",
15618,0,," this will help change practices of sexuality-discrimination in nations across the world .
",
15619,0,," one of the most effective ways to engage the international community on swift action to protect certain rights is to make a clear , bold statement against a particular type of behaviour .
",
15620,0,," by acting to not just condemn a certain behaviour , but actively circumvent states ' ability to carry out such a behaviour , the international community sends a message of the unacceptability of such practices .
",
15621,0,," moreover , and more importantly , regardless of if the countries are persuaded into agreeing with the international community on the issues of lgbt rights , this action will still change state behaviour .
",
15622,0,," this will happen for two reasons : the best example of this is that due to strong and vocal condemnation of the bahati bill in uganda which would have imposed the death penalty for the crime of homosexuality , the cabinet committee rejected the bill .
",
15623,0,," therefore , this policy is instrumental in changing state behaviour towards sexual orientation and making the first steps towards acceptance and ending discrimination .
",
15624,0,," global consensus on progressive rights for the lgbt community will be aided through this policy .
",
15625,0,," one of the most powerful weapons in the international community 's arsenal is the soft power of condemnation .
",
15626,0,," one of the most important things the international community can do is use its weight and influence to advocate protection of vulnerable peoples and promote moral and social causes .
",
15627,0,," the west with its immense wealth and importance in international institutions such as the united nations have a lot of power when it comes to influencing discriminatory policies in other nations .
",
15628,0,," granting asylum to people on the basis of sexual orientation sends a clear message to the international community that it is not okay to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and that the west not only strongly disapproves of this behaviour , but that , more importantly , they will take active steps to counter-act your discriminatory policies .
",
15629,0,," this has immense impact on pressuring governments to change their policies .
",
15630,0,," what is important to note here is that there is a gradual normative consensus that is manufactured under this system .
",
15631,0,," through the use of soft power , the policies of nations are slowly but surely moderated and a global consensus is created .
",
15632,0,," not only can this policy influence current state behaviour , but that the influence and change that creates becomes part of a larger global move towards universal acceptance of the norm and the diffusion of that idea throughout all strata of society .
",
15633,0,," this is important in two ways : making sexual orientation a category for asylum not only saves lives , but also sends a strong and influential message that helps craft policy in nations who use discrimination as a tool of oppression against the lgbt community .
",
15634,0,," this begins the foundations of global consensus on equality for all sexual orientations and a lasting solution to the issue of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
",
15635,1,,"in 2007, eliot spitzer, governor of new york proposed that all illegal immigrants in his state should be allowed to obtain drivers licenses.
",
15636,1,," at the time, it was estimated that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 illegal immigrants were residing in new york state, most of them driving on the roads despite a lack of a driver’s license.
",
15637,1,," spitzer proposed that instead of needing an american social security number to get a driver’s license, new york would also accept a foreign passport as adequate identification to obtain a license.
",
15638,1,,"the move for giving illegal immigrants licenses is an issue that has arisen and re-arisen multiple times, especially in states with high illegal immigrant populations such as california.
",
15639,1,," however, american citizens are seemingly overwhelmingly against this policy with over 70% of new yorkers polling against this policy.
",
15640,1,," this creates a debate over what the impact of these licenses will be and how the public’s perception of this policy weighs up against these potential benefits.
",
15641,1,," currently, seven states in the us allow illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses: hawaii, maine, michigan, new mexico, oregon, utah and washington.
",
15642,0,," offering drivers licenses to illegal immigrants makes the streets safer by giving drivers training to people who would otherwise be driving on the streets without adequate education .
",
15643,0,," unlicensed drivers are five times more likely to get into a fatal crash than licensed drivers .
",
15644,0,," a fact that needs to be acknowledged is that illegal immigrants have a necessity to drive and the vast majority will do so regardless of if they are given licenses or not .
",
15645,0,," this is very dangerous both for them and for those who they share the road with as they are operating motor vehicles with a proper education on the rules of the road or any form of driving instruction or test to ensure that they can competently and safely drive on the streets .
",
15646,0,," illegal immigrants are very likely to opt into this system of driver 's education and licensing because it is in their own interest to avoid breaking the law to avoid detection , but also because it is very much in their interest to get instruction on how to drive as they are as much a danger to themselves as they are to the rest of society when they drive without instruction .
",
15647,0,," therefore , offering illegal immigrants driver 's licenses will help make the streets safer by giving drivers access to the education and instruction they need to be safe and competent drivers .
",
15648,0,," insurance is a key component in making the streets safe for all drivers on the road .
",
15649,0,," allowing illegal immigrants to get driver 's licenses allows them to gain driver 's insurance .
",
15650,0,," driving absent insurance means that there is an incentive to drive off if you cause an accident to avoid having to pay for the damages you have caused and being criminally punished for driving without insurance .
",
15651,0,," this leaves the other driver having to foot their own bill for the repairs to their vehicles .
",
15652,0,," moreover , even if the uninsured driver stays at the scene , illegal immigrants are characteristically very poor as they must engage in exploitative work to make a wage because they must hide from the state and do not get the same protections from the state , so would still be unable to pay for the damages they have caused .
",
15653,0,," moreover , having uninsured drivers on the road increases insurance premiums for all insured drivers on the road , as they have to de-facto pay for the risk and damage these uninsured drivers cause .
",
15654,0,," therefore , offering illegal immigrants driver 's licenses allows for more fair and accountable systems of insurance and driving conditions on the road .
",
15655,0,," drivers licenses are used a major form of identification in america and so granting illegal immigrants these forms of identification can help enfranchise one of the most exploited minorities in america .
",
15656,0,," despite american feelings on illegal immigrants , they are there in their society , contribute to their communities and are a group of people that are routinely and unjustly exploited because of their lack of access to state protection .
",
15657,0,," despite popular opinion of this being a punishment for breaking their laws , these people operate like any other citizen in american society and are human beings who deserve to be treated as such and to be offered at least some level of protection for the fact that they are human and for what they contribute to america communities and society .
",
15658,0,," providing these people with a proper form of identification , especially a driver 's license , which is almost universally accepted as an adequate form of identification to access services from the state and to interact with the rest of society .
",
15659,0,," specifically , this allows immigrant communities to not feel as though they are confined to an isolated area as they now can travel further distances to gain better employment without fear of being caught and thrown into jail .
",
15660,0,," moreover , this allows them access to all services offered by the state that require identification such as voter registration .
",
15661,0,," therefore , this helps enfranchise a group that is normally exploited in america society .
",
15662,1,," once rio di janeiro has hosted thesummer olympics, africa will be the only continent not to have hosted the summer olympic games.
",
15663,1,," previous olympic bids by african countries include cairo for(which did not get past the first stage), and cape town, which came third in the voting for thegames behind rome, and athens which went on to host the games.
",
15664,1,,"south africa has a track record of successfully hosting major sporting events.
",
15665,1,," following coming second in the bidding process for thetournament, south africa hosted thefifa (football) world cup, the first of two under a since dropped system of continent rotation, beating out competition from morocco and egypt.
",
15666,1,,"  thetournament ""set a new benchmark"", according to fifa secretary-general jerome valcke.
",
15667,1,," south africa has also hosted the cricket world cup in 2003, and the rugby world cup in 1995, in which the home team was victorious.
",
15668,1,," the first big sporting event hosted by south africa after the collapse of apartheid, thetournament was immortalized by the image of nelson mandela handing the trophy over to the victorious springboks captain, francois pienaar, while wearing a shirt and cap of the team which had symbolized white minority rule.
",
15669,1,,"the death of mandela caused the first post-apartheid south african olympic medallist, elana meyer, to suggest that the time is right for south africa to host the olympic games.
",
15670,1,," possible venues for a south african games could include johannesburg (which held theworld cup final), and cape town, which was a candidate for thegames.
",
15671,1,," johannesburg and cape town are considered to be alpha- and beta+ world cities, respectively.
",
15672,0,," a key reason why countries host the olympic games is in order to boost their image abroad -- china held thegames in beijing as part of an exercise in national promotion .
",
15673,0,," this would also be an opportunity to change the perceptions of africa amongst some elements in the outside world , from an inaccurate picture of a `` third world '' continent with no features other than poverty and violence to a more accurate depiction of a continent which , while having challenges , is having economic growth and advancing human development .
",
15674,0,," south africa is the best nation to showcase the development of africa ; it is africa 's biggest economy and one of its most developed .
",
15675,0,," while hosting a major sporting event is relatively expensive , although cape town and johannesburg already have a number of appropriate venues for some of the events already , hosting major sporting events creates major economic benefits .
",
15676,0,," london got a # 10bn economic boost from hosting theolympics .
",
15677,0,," this may be higher -- many of these benefits are difficult to calculate ; how much of a tourism boost is a result of a successful games ?
",
15678,0,," barcelona however just like london had a large boost of tourism following thebarcelona games .
",
15679,0,," it raises awareness of the city , and the country , and what it offers as a tourist destination .
",
15680,0,," hosting very large sporting events is a great way to advertise a nation , and create a national feel-good factor .
",
15681,0,," when london hosted the games in, a successful event with a successful home team , there was a significant national `` feel good factor '' .
",
15682,0,," this can bring the benefit of bringing a nation together ; particularly important for multi-ethnic countries such as south africa , it will bring all ethnicities together in a shared experience helping to justify the label of ` rainbow nation ' .
",
15683,0,," as sports minister fikile mbalula argues `` sport is said to be a national religion in south africa .
",
15684,0,," in recent years it transcends race , class , language and geographical location . ''
",
15685,1,,"the uefa eurotournament is being jointly hosted by poland and ukraine.
",
15686,1,," the football is scheduled to start on 8th june with a match between poland and greece and it will run until 1st july.
",
15687,1,," the final will be held in the olympic stadium in kyiv the capital of ukraine.
",
15688,1,," this will put ukraine in the spotlight throughout the tournament as leaders regularly attend international tournaments to show their support for their national team and sometimes engage in some international diplomacy on the side.
",
15689,1,," there have however been calls for europe’s leaders to not attend, to boycott, those games that are to be held in ukraine.
",
15690,1,,"  german chancellor angela merkel has been campaigning for a mass boycott by european leaders and she has been joined by the austrians.
",
15691,1,," others such as the european commission president barroso and british foreign minister william hague have said they will be staying away without explicitly stating that they are boycotting the tournament.
",
15692,1,," the furore has been caused by the conviction of yulia timoshenko on charges of criminally exceeding her authority over a 10-year gas contract signed with russia in january 2009.
",
15693,1,," timoshenko and her supporters claim it was a politically motivated show trial and an attempt by the president of ukraine viktor yanukovych to prevent his main rival from contesting elections in the future.
",
15694,1,," timoshenko went on hunger strike in april having accused prison guards of beating her and fearing that the ukrainian authorities would attempt to have her killed.
",
15695,1,," although timoshenko ended her hunger strike on 9th may the international fallout continues.
",
15696,0,," viktor yanukovych fairly came to power inhowever since then he has set about attacking the country 's fragile democracy .
",
15697,0,," there are numerous cases showing this democratic decline .
",
15698,0,," for example changes to the constitution that occurred after the orange revolution have been rolled back to give more power to the presidency .
",
15699,0,," most visibly opponents of the regime such as yulia timoshenko have been jailed in politically motivated trials .
",
15700,0,," at the same time there have been attacks on the freedom of the media and ukraine has fallen down rankings of press freedom in 2010-11 with its score from freedom house falling fromtowith its ranking falling to 130th .
",
15701,0,," ukraine , like its neighbours russia and belarus , has become a ` virtual mafia state ' where the sbu , ukraine 's successor to the kgb , is all powerful and the elite are unaccountable .
",
15702,0,," it is becoming more and more corrupt as is shown by its fall down the corruption perceptions index from 118th into 152nd in.
",
15703,0,," ukraine is clearly going in the wrong direction and european leaders need to stand up and show that the will not allow this to continue .
",
15704,0,," european leaders must take a stand on human rights in their own back yard if they are to be taken seriously on the issue anywhere in the world .
",
15705,0,," there are numerous human rights abuses in ukraine ; migrants `` risk abusive treatment and arbitrary detention '' , roma and people with dark skin in particular face governmental and societal discrimination and some xenophobic attacks and may be prosecuted for acting in self defense .
",
15706,0,," amnesty international has highlighted abuse of power by the police `` numerous cases in eurohost cities in which police have tortured people in an attempt to extort money , extract a confession , or simply because of the victims ' sexuality or ethnic origin '' .
",
15707,0,," if europe turns a blind eye to these kinds of abuses in neighbouring states without even a minor diplomatic snub it will not have the moral authority to confront worse abuses elsewhere in the world .
",
15708,0,," states that are abusing their own citizens would shrug off criticism believing that european states will not back their criticism up with any action .
",
15709,0,," diplomacy is necessary with any regime almost no matter how oppressive they are however that does not show approval of a regime to the world in the way that high profile visits and events can .
",
15710,0,," just as the beijing olympics were the people 's republic of china 's coming out party so eurois an ideal chance for ukraine to show itself off to europe and the rest of the world .
",
15711,0,," if there was not a boycott this would implicitly show that europe approves of ukraine and the actions of its government .
",
15712,0,," in a list of possible diplomatic responses that range from verbal diplomatic complaints right up to sanctions a boycott represents a mid-point .
",
15713,0,," a boycott is perhaps the best action that the european union leaders could take is it takes away the shine that the event would otherwise give the yanukovych .
",
15714,0,," it will be denying him the political benefits of the euros while highlighting rights concerns .
",
15715,0,," a boycott is also proportional because it gives ukraine 's leaders a chance to reform before beginning any further measures that would have a much deeper effect on diplomatic relations .
",
15716,1,,"even following the collapse of white minority rule, south africa is still a country with many racial divides in society.
",
15717,1,," sport is no exception.
",
15718,1,,"rugby union was, and still is, a sport associated with white groups, particularly afrikaans speakers, in south africa.
",
15719,1,," before fully democratic rule in 1994, the national team, the springboks, were considered poster boys for apartheid.
",
15720,1,," they were met with opposition after thegleneagles agreement between commonwealth nations, which signalled the strong support for a sporting boycott of south africa.
",
15721,1,," south africa did not compete in a rugby world cup until thetournament, held in south africa shortly after the end of apartheid.
",
15722,1,," the home team famously won, but the abiding image of the final was nelson mandela, political prisoner turned president, presenting the william webb ellis trophy to captain francois pienaar.
",
15723,1,,"despite the increase in non-white participation (the national team only contained one non-white player in 1995, chester arthur, but there were nine non-white players in the national first team for two major matches in 2013), even after the end of apartheid, rugby union is a sport largely comprised of the white minority, in particular afrikaans speakers.
",
15724,1,," while south africa is one of the most competitive nations in international rugby, the sport is not the most popular in the country (that is football).
",
15725,1,," rugby union has been seen as, to some extent, a sport for social “elites” in many, but not all of the countries it has been played.
",
15726,1,,"effective for theseason, the south african rugby union has created a system of racial quotas in the third tier vodacom cup competition (below the super rugby competition run with australia and new zealand, and the currie cup, the flagship domestic competition).
",
15727,1,," each side, which represents all or part of a south african province (except for a kenyan team), will have to have a minimum number of black players: seven in each match-dayplayer squad, two of which forwards, five of which in the starting fifteen.
",
15728,1,," no penalties for violation of these quotas have been outlined by saru.
",
15729,1,,"no such quota system is used for the national team, or the currie cup and super rugby.
",
15730,1,," a quota system was introduced in 1999, but dropped in 2004.
",
15731,1,," in south africa, cricket (another sport historically far more popular in white communities) has used quotas too, with the domestic professional franchises required to field one black player with cash bonuses available for those who play more than one.
",
15732,1,,"afriforum, an organization linked to the largely white afrikaans speaking trade union solidariteit, has criticized the measure and has suggested it might be against the rules of the world governing body, the international rugby board, whose by-lawprohibits racial discrimination.
",
15733,0,," it is plain for all to see how unrepresentative rugby union in south africa is .
",
15734,0,," while there is not necessarily a deliberate policy of racism , it is very easy for biases to creep in .
",
15735,0,," across the division where the quotas will come in only about% of players are black , a number that should increase to% .
",
15736,0,," quotas could help concentrate the mind to ensure that the best team is picked .
",
15737,0,," at grass roots level , there have been some cases of flat-out racial abuse of non-white players , including using racial terms that are particularly offensive in a south african context .
",
15738,0,," the talent pool in south african rugby is not as racially diverse as one would expect from the `` rainbow nation '' -- some commentators have argued that england and france produce more top level black players than south africa .
",
15739,0,," this is because top level players are a result of development from the grassroots up .
",
15740,0,," targets or quotas could not only improve the talent pool of today , but could broaden it for the future .
",
15741,0,," a new generation of youth across all races in south africa would be able to see that rugby union is a sport that accepts people from their backgrounds , making them more likely to participate in rugby union , either as players , coaches , referees or as a general part of the rugby fraternity .
",
15742,0,," in, the south african social attitudes survey revealed that most south africans ,% , support a quota system .
",
15743,0,," this support remained roughly the same over a four year period .
",
15744,0,," sport should reflect the will of the population of the country , if the population wants quotas then there should be quotas .
",
15745,0,," there is particularly strong support from quotas among black people ,% , implying they feel that something needs to be done in order to let them into the sport .
",
15746,0,," doing nothing will simply ensure the status quo with very few non-white rugby players remains indefinitely .
",
15747,1,,"undoubtedly, international competitions are by far the most popular and prestigious tournaments throughout the world of sports.
",
15748,1,," for decades, countries have tried to prove their supremacy on this stage, but in order to do that they need their most talented players available.
",
15749,1,," in the light of recent events, like an episode involving samuel eto’o who refused to play for cameroon’s national football team, questions have been raised regarding the duty of an individual to represent their country at an international level.
",
15750,1,," some say that the participation should be mandatory, while others claim that even if the players have a moral duty, the decision is entirely in their own hands.
",
15751,1,," some federations, like the polish volleyball association are currently considering fines for not wanting to represent your country(1), so this phenomenon might escalate in the near future.
",
15752,1,," as far as punishments are concerned, they could range from fines to more severe ones like excluding athletes from national competitions, and so on.
",
15753,1,," this would always be at the discretion of the national sports associations and might differ from case to case as well as between sports.
",
15754,1,," moreover, another pressing point of interest regarding this topic is whether sportsmen should be allowed to represent a country with which they have very loose ties with(a distant relative or have only lived there a short time), thus allowing countries to virtually buy their services or if this should be forbidden.
",
15755,0,,"  as “naturalizing players” becomes more and more often in the world of sports, this issue might be the topic of a fierce debate in the future.
",
15756,0,,"it is clear that any individual , no matter his chosen area of expertise needs the appropriate environment to achieve his maximum potential .
",
15757,0,," the people involved in professional sports are no exception .
",
15758,0,," they need coaches to guide them , stadiums in which to practice , sponsorship and funding to allow participation at some competitions .
",
15759,0,," any person who succeeded in making a career in sports partly owes it to the society he grew up in that provided these facilities and opportunities .
",
15760,0,," let us not forget that especially in poor areas , most of the sports trainings are done `` pro bono '' by good samaritans who want to lend a hand .
",
15761,0,," therefore , as other people invested in their development , every sportsman has the moral duty to pass on that help , and also lend a helping hand towards those who were n't as privileged .
",
15762,0,," representing the nation is a part of this moral duty to repay that which the country has given .
",
15763,0,," this improves the image of that country and allows it to get the recognition in deserves for bringing up such talented players .
",
15764,0,," cristiano ronaldo is one of best paid soccer players in the world and mainly got to where he is due to his talent , determination and countless hours on the pitch .
",
15765,0,," but he was also born in portugal , where he took advantage of the entire football industry that exists there .
",
15766,0,," if he had been born in sri lanka , his talent would have gone unnoticed .
",
15767,0,," undoubtedly , one of the most important things for a professional sportsperson is to have a long , healthy and fulfilling career .
",
15768,0,," no matter what a sportspersons motivation is , whether it is the pleasure from winning or the money a player always needs to be in top form .
",
15769,0,," playing on the international level helps athletes improve themselves .
",
15770,0,," first of all , no matter of sport , the level of the sport is much more intense when it is international , as obviously , the best players are taking part in it .
",
15771,0,," santos vs boca juniors have always been very thrilling football matches , but none of them compare with the matches between brazil and argentina .
",
15772,0,," if you , as an athlete , are forced to play in a much more competitive environment , then you have to bring your a-game to the pitch on every single occasion as the stakes are high every single time .
",
15773,0,," in time , this improves skills and develops capabilities , as you are challenged on regular basis .
",
15774,0,," second of all , when it comes to team sports a lot of scouts are watching internationals in the hopes of spotting new potential talents for big teams .
",
15775,0,," this can be a very good opportunity for players to get noticed and to receive the credit they deserve .
",
15776,0,," for example luis suarez transferred to liverpool for # 22.8 million in januaryshortly after theworld cup ,  while alex furgeson noted on having bought javier hernández '' if we had waited until after the world cup we would have had to pay maybe three times the price ''  .
",
15777,0,," if they fail to seize the opportunity , players are much more likely to remain unnoticed and unknown outside their own country .
",
15778,0,," it is in their interest to be in the spotlight for the greatest amount of time , and there is no bigger stage than international competitions .
",
15779,0,," it is not just the player or athlete who benefits from taking part in international competitions but the nation as well .
",
15780,0,," every nation wants to do well in international sporting completions and every national wants their nation to do well internationally .
",
15781,0,," every country wants all of their best sportspeople to take part so that they have as much success as possible .
",
15782,0,," this is partially about prestige ; jamaica is perhaps best known worldwide at the moment as a result of the fame of usain bolt and other successful sprinters , if it was not known for this it might instead be known for its gang wars and murder which is not what a country wants people to think of when their country is mentioned .
",
15783,0,,"  but it is also about the economy .
",
15784,0,," countries that do well in international competitions may get an economic boost as a result .
",
15785,0,," economists suggested that winning the world cup could have a positive impact of between 0.25 and 0.5 % , which if it is in the context of near zero growth can be a big impact .
",
15786,0,," this is a result of the feel-good factor from the victory .
",
15787,0,," and we must not forget that feel-good factor itself ; wining international competitions , or even just individual events lifts the mood of the country .
",
15788,0,," and if a country is successful in a sport then that sport provides an opportunity to bring social benefits through social programs to reduce violence or campaigns such as that against racism .
",
15789,0,,"  success is however something which is much more likely if a country is able to field its best athletes and players internationally .
",
15790,1,,"qatar was the surprise winners in decemberof fifa’s vote to determine the hosts for theworld cup beating out competition from the united states, south korea, japan, and australia.
",
15791,1,," in recent months, a lot of concerns have been raised about the temperatures in qatar in summer, when the cup is scheduled to take place.
",
15792,1,," fears that searing summer temperatures of more than 40c could pose a risk to the health of players and supporters convinced a lot of sporting officials to try and move the world cup in winter, when the heat dips to an average of 20c.
",
15793,1,," if this were to happen it would be for the first time inyears that the tournament has not been held in the summer.
",
15794,1,," qatari officials state that they are more than prepared to install air conditioning systems in the stadiums, but this may not be enough to make the games an enjoyable experience for the thousands of fans.
",
15795,0,," in order to fully understand the implications of this motion , one must see what participating in the fifa world cup means to a football player .
",
15796,0,," first of all , it means an intense and sustained physical effort for a significant amount of time .
",
15797,0,," do not forget that the cup itself lasts for a couple of weeks , and there are plenty of weeks of training before it in order to get the players in the best shape possible .
",
15798,0,," this means they are exposed to a lot of physical stress and have to play or train no matter of the weather conditions or temperature .
",
15799,0,," secondly , with temperatures ranging from 35c to 40c during the summer it would be torture to force the players to train and play in those conditions .
",
15800,0,," former france , fulham , manchester united and everton striker louis saha told bbc sport he thought it was impossible for players to handle the middle eastern country 's extremely high summer temperatures .
",
15801,0,,"  `` i was in qatar recently and it was 48c , '' he said .
",
15802,0,," `` believe me , it is impossible to have a proper game down there . ''
",
15803,0,," it is not only the players who get hurt , but also the game itself , as you can not expect the same show from fatigued , light-headed and exhausted players .
",
15804,0,," most of all , fifa 's top priority should always be the protection of player 's health , as , at the end of the day , despite money , show or spectators , no one should risk their life or be obliged to work in unsafe conditions .
",
15805,0,," studies show the immense risks of heat-related illnesses and their potentially deadly outcome .
",
15806,0,,"  being aware of these issues , fifa 's vice-president jim boyce , from northern ireland , is prepared to back a decision in principle to move the world cup to the winter .
",
15807,0,,"  one of the most important parts of the game is the fans .
",
15808,0,," they are the ones who watch the sport , they are the ones to which football owes its popularity .
",
15809,0,," not only are they the ones who pay for the sport they are also a vital part of any competition .
",
15810,0,," without the choreographies made by the supporters and the impressive cheering , football becomes nothing more than a silent , mediocre sport .
",
15811,0,," as a result , we must take into consideration how well these hundreds of thousands of supporters from all over the world who will come to qatar feel during the world cup .
",
15812,0,," let us not forget , that they will spend most of the time outside the stadia ; on the streets , in the gruelling heat , or they will be forced indoors .
",
15813,0,," unfortunately , for many of them this experience will be overshadowed by the constant heat-caused discomfort when engaging in the kind of socialising and watching matches at outdoor screens that usually creates the atmosphere of the cup .
",
15814,0,," it is even more worrying when you take into consideration the fact that supporters of all ages and health conditions come here , some of them will be exposing themselves to heat related risks .
",
15815,0,," heatstroke can potentially cause death .
",
15816,0,," taking this into consideration , uefa 'smember associations have already backed a switch , while europe 's leading clubs have said they are `` open '' to the possibility of a winter world cup in qatar .
",
15817,0,,"  theworld cup in qatar must switch to winter , according to fifa 's own medical chief .
",
15818,0,," michel d'hooghe , the chairman of the fifa 's medical committee , will advise that the risks posed to supporters by extreme heat are too great .
",
15819,0,," `` i am sure the qataris have the technical skill to organise a tournament where teams could play and train in a stable , acceptable temperature , but it 's about the fans .
",
15820,0,," they will need to travel from venue to venue and i think it 's not a good idea for them to do that in temperatures of 47c or more . ''
",
15821,0,,"  there a lot of advantages for you as a country if you are selected to organize a world cup , a european cup or any kind of major sport event .
",
15822,0,," they range from fame and international recognition to money and influence in the administrative bodies .
",
15823,0,," therefore , it is in qatar 's interest that this event goes as smoothly as possible in order to prove its organizing capabilities and thus allowing them to increase its chance for hosting any kind of future sporting event .
",
15824,0,," by hosting the event in summer , qatar is exposing itself a lot of unnecessary risk -- and probable bad publicity .
",
15825,0,," the most obvious is someone getting injured or even worse , dying during the world cup .
",
15826,0,," this would be extremely problematic especially if we are talking about a football player participating in the event .
",
15827,0,," it would not only stain qatar 's image because it happened during the world cup organized there , but it would also destroy any credibility that it has as an organiser of events after so many assurances that the heat will not be a problem .
",
15828,0,," moreover if the cup were to be held in winter , some of the billions that would be used to build such complex systems of air conditioning could be used to serve other purposes .
",
15829,0,," the qataris could invest it in better publicity , more social campaigns such as discouraging racism in sports or many other areas .
",
15830,0,," in that way , not only they would receive the recognition for being the organizers of the world cup , but they would get extra credit from the international community for being involved in the social benefits of sports for example .
",
15831,0,," in conclusion , the qataris do have the administrative support for a change of schedule , as even sepp blatter , fifa 's president has recognised `` after many discussions , deliberations and critical review of the entire matter , i came to the conclusion that playing the world cup in the heat of qatar 's summer was simply not a responsible thing to do '' and they should take advantage of this situation .
",
15832,1,," allowing women to play against men in the same sporting leagues has been a debate almost since the start of professional sporting leagues.
",
15833,1,," the issue is whether there can be no competition between men and women due to men’s superior physical strength and about letting women compete into men’s leagues (not necessarily merging the two) as a solution to gender discrimination.
",
15834,1,,"  as sports competitions are getting bigger, richer, and more televised and accessible, this debate is of crucial importance as it could transform the face of almost every sporting competition.
",
15835,1,," now, in the majority of sports there is a separation between sexes, but lately there has been a growing number of female athletes requested that they would be allowed to play in men’s leagues.
",
15836,0,," there are a few examples of females being allowed in men’s leagues such as the example of danica patrick, a nascar driver, and annika sorenstam who played golf against men at the p.g.a. tournament in 2003, but there are only two olympic sports which allow the two sexes compete head-to-head: equestrian and sailing.
",
15837,0,,"in sports it is crucial that the best person wins no matter of his or her sex .
",
15838,0,," we should let the women decide if they are prepared enough to participate in men 's events , and not take that decision for them by forcing them into set leagues .
",
15839,0,," american skier lindsey vonn has won the women 's world cup four times .
",
15840,0,," in november, she asked to be allowed to compete in the men 's event .
",
15841,0,," the request was denied  .
",
15842,0,," if a female athlete can perform better than a male athlete in a certain discipline , she should be allowed to compete with , and beat , the male athlete .
",
15843,0,," the examples of danica patrick , a `` nascar driver who won theindy japanand finished 3rd in theindy'' and seena hogan who holds multiple records in ultra cycling , which have n't been beaten by any man or women to this day  , show us how women can improve a competition in a significant way .
",
15844,0,," at the end of the day , it does n't matter who wins , the very purpose of sports forces us to let them take the decision , as we can not accurately suppose that women are worse than men at every single competition of every single sporting event as shown by the stated examples .
",
15845,0,," assuming we would have two equally muscular and equally fast male and female athletes , the current system clearly discriminates the female athlete by not allowing her to compete in the male league .
",
15846,0,," it is against the very nature of sports to treat differently two athletes who have the same strength , speed , agility , dexterity , mental focus , determination , ambition based purely on their type of chromosomes .
",
15847,0,," this is extremely important as most of the time the women 's competition gets less attention from the public and sponsors , as seen in the cases of women 's national basketball association and national women 's football association .
",
15848,0,," so , by forcing them to stay in those leagues , you are denying potentially successful athletes fame , pride and money .
",
15849,0,," the giro rosa , one of the biggest women cycling competition , offers a prize money ofeuros , which is a mere thousandth of the tour de france 's 450,000 euro top prize .
",
15850,0,,"  one of the best ways to have a healthy life , avoid obesity and learn crucial values like respect , teamwork and fair play is by practicing a sport .
",
15851,0,," in order to incentivize women from around the world to get involved you need to give them role models ; women who receive a lot of media coverage to whom they can look up to .
",
15852,0,," unfortunately , women 's sports do n't receive as much media coverage as men 's sports because they are considered to be less spectacular and thrilling .
",
15853,0,," by allowing certain women , who have the necessary skills to compete against men to get this coverage you will give young girls the necessary motivation to start practicing sports , thus bringing a massive social benefit to the society .
",
15854,0,," this happens already to successful women who are lucky enough to compete with men , as shown by danica patrick , so why should we stop here ?
",
15855,1,,"605 million people in the world are estimated to know how to play chess: overmillion are registered competitively, representing overcountries.1 despite its presence throughout history and geography, and despite having been recognised as a sport by the international olympic committee in 1999, chess has never been a discipline in the olympic games.
",
15856,1,,"the world chess federation (fide) has been campaigning for years for this to happen.
",
15857,1,," its first attempt infailed because of problems distinguishing amateur from professional chess players2, since the olympic games were originally restricted to amateurs.
",
15858,1,," now, however, this criterion has been dropped.3 sincechess has also been accepted into the asian games, the world's second biggest multi sport games which is organised by the olympic council of asia and recognised by the international olympic committee, as a part of the category of board games which also includes weiqi (go) and xiangqi (chinese chess).4yet there are still obstacles to chess being included in the olympics.
",
15859,1,," it is still rarely perceived as a sport, not to mention an olympic sport, and the olympic games have a limited capacity regarding how many sports they can include.
",
15860,1,," why then should chess, a mind sport rather than a conventional sport, be included in future games?
",
15861,0,,"[2] brace, edward r. “an illustrated dictionary of chess”, hamlyn publishing group, p. 64, 1977.
",
15862,0,,"chess is not a predominantly physical sport , yet neither are shooting and curling , which , in fact , has been nicknamed `` chess on ice ''.
",
15863,0,," the opposition may respond that the determining factor in these is still physical , such as speed and precision .
",
15864,0,," however , chess too requires precise calculation in short periods of time .
",
15865,0,," there is no relevant distinction to be drawn between the human brain and other organs : both can be trained and strained , and doing so should be equally rewarded .
",
15866,0,," more importantly , taekwondo is a further example of what may be called a mind sport .
",
15867,0,," as in chess , both participants have the same set of moves which can be combined in a near infinite number of ways : it thus becomes a battle of intellect and strategy rather than strength .
",
15868,0,," the body merely becomes the vessel through which to compete , precisely as a chess board .
",
15869,0,," although the vessels are different , the fundamental activity is the same , and thus if taekwondo is valid as an olympic sport , so should chess be .
",
15870,0,," when the ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau stated that `` mind sports , by their nature , can not be part of the program '', she contradicted olympic history .
",
15871,0,," the ancient greek panhellenic games , forerunners of the modern olympic games , indeed emphasised musical , theatrical and painting competitions .7 even the modern olympic games had non-physical competitions such as painting , design and poetry betweenand 1952.8 through chess , the cultural and mental aspect now lost in the olympic games is protected .
",
15872,0,," the limits of human capability can be investigated from a new , intellectual , angle .
",
15873,0,," this would allow the games to celebrate , as intended , human potential in its entirety .
",
15874,0,," the sports in the olympics promote good values : they display attributes and disciplines that we want to encourage in society and children in particular .
",
15875,0,," chess is no different from this .
",
15876,0,," numerous studies have shown that chess has large cognitive benefits , strengthening a wide range of skills : problem-solving , decision-making , memory , mathematics , logic , and creative thinking .9 ,these are skills we want to actively promote , and thus if including chess in the olympics would increase its support , we should do so .
",
15877,0,," making chess an olympic sport would make it more accessible to people who would otherwise not watch it .
",
15878,0,," it would also incentivise young enthusiasts to become more involved in the hope of participating in such a recognised competition .
",
15879,0,," bringing chess to a highly recognised event would doubtless increase support , and thus have an objectively positive impact on society .
",
15880,0,," chess is among the sports with the greatest number of federations and of active participants worldwide .12 its large fan base , however , is completely unrepresented in the world 's largest sports competition .
",
15881,0,," chess , furthermore , is highly viewer friendly , so its popularity would only flourish from its representation .
",
15882,0,," it is possible to broadcast any game online , for all to watch at home .
",
15883,0,," games also often feature high commentary action explaining and analysing the players ' strategies , to make them approachable and exciting to the public .
",
15884,0,," furthermore , it could take the shape of a team sport in the olympics , leaving greater space for tactics and discouraging draws , once again making it more appealing for a broad audience .
",
15885,1,,"fordays every four years the summer olympics attract the world's attention and the host city gets immense media coverage.
",
15886,1,," yet many argue that the huge cost of hosting the olympic games means that cities are left with crippling bills and empty stadiam once thosedays are over.
",
15887,1,," montreal, the host in 1976, is still paying off the cost of staging the games today and the athens olympics ofran billions of euros over the original budget - at state expense.
",
15888,1,," the scandal surrounding the bidding process for the salt lake citywinter games revealed thatof theinternational olympic committee (ioc) members who were tasked with deciding who should be awarded the games were 'bought' with gifts and bribes.
",
15889,1,," since then the ioc has tightened up its regulations but rumours of corruption amongst some members remain and were revealed by a bbc sting operation in 2004.
",
15890,1,," whilst proponents of hosting the games generally accept that they will inevitably cost significant amounts of money, they argue that the 'feel good factor' and longer term benefits justify this outlay.
",
15891,0,," hosting creates a ` feel-good factor ' .
",
15892,0,," it is hard to put a price on the buzz that surrounds international sporting events .
",
15893,0,," think of paris during the world football cup inor sydney during theolympics .
",
15894,0,," even sporting success abroad can unite a nation , for example the england rugby union team 's victory in therugby world cup in australia .
",
15895,0,," governments are aware of the huge potential for boosting national pride and national unity .
",
15896,0,," the parisbid has used a well-known footballer , zinedine zidane , who is the son of an immigrant to stress how hosting the olympics would bring parisians of all backgrounds together .
",
15897,0,," it is partly because of this ` feel-good factor ' that so many people want their city to host the olympics ,% of parisians and% of londoners want theolympics .
",
15898,0,," hosting stimulates regeneration .
",
15899,0,," the ioc is enthusiastic about bids that will leave a lasting impact and have looked favourably on cities that locate their olympic villages and stadia in deprived areas in need of regeneration .
",
15900,0,," thebarcelona olympics were used as a means to completely overhaul the port and coast of the city creating an artificial beach and waterside cultural area that became a lasting tourist attraction .
",
15901,0,," along with cleaning up areas and new stadia , olympic villages release between 5,000 and 20,000 new homes which governments can chose to hand over as low-cost housing , as is proposed for london.
",
15902,0,," whilst these projects could be completed without the olympics , the need to provide an overall package , transport , accommodation , stadia , greenery etc. , for a set deadline means that there is far more incentive to get the projects done .
",
15903,0,," an example of this in london is the plan for a new # 15bn underground rail system called ` crossrail ' , first proposed overyears ago but only now being developed because of the attention surrounding the londonbid .1 the fact that international scrutiny will follow the building program means that it is far more likely to be completed to a high standard , consider the detailed coverage of the preparations for athens.
",
15904,0,," the olympics are a showcase .
",
15905,0,," hosting the olympics can be a way of making a strong political point because of the intense media scrutiny that accompanies the games .
",
15906,0,," during the cold war both moscowand los angeleswere used by the ussr and usa to show their economic strength .
",
15907,0,," seoul inused the games to demonstrate south korea 's economic and political maturity .
",
15908,0,," the beijing olympics inare seen by many as evidence of china 's acceptance into the global community and a way for her to showcase her economic growth and acceptance of the west .
",
15909,0,," for new york , thebid is a way of showing that the post-9 /healing process has been completed and that the city is ` open for business ' despite the terrorist attacks .
",
15910,0,," hosting creates an economic boost .
",
15911,0,," whilst none of the olympics of recent times have made an immediate profit , the cost of the regeneration and improved infrastructure means that this is not a big problem as long as the losses are not huge .
",
15912,0,," the olympics showcases the host nation to the world and most hosts have seen a boost in tourism in the years after the olympics , australia estimates it gained # 2bn extra tourist revenue in the four years after sydney.
",
15913,0,," during the games between 60,000 , parisestimate , and 135,000 , new yorkestimate , jobs are created providing skills and training to local people .
",
15914,1,,"boxing, the physical skill of fighting with fists, originated as a sport around 800bc.
",
15915,1,," it is a sport of antiquity that has had a troubled and contentious livelihood.
",
15916,1,," the modern day sport has developed from rules and standards established since this time; with two participation forms: professional and amateur.
",
15917,1,," each has its own rules, although for both forms of boxing, a win is achieved by scoring more points than an opponent by delivering more blows to the designated scoring regions of the body (trunk and head), or by an opponent being unable to complete a bout.4 when first started, this sport was designed as entertainment for aristocrats who enjoyed watching two people ‘slug it out’ to the death.
",
15918,1,," that history has continued into the present day sport which is a largely entertainment based activity, with millions of dollars of investment at the highest of levels.
",
15919,1,," the potential dangers of the sport are a double-edged sword - they create both the entertainment aspect that makes boxing popular, but also run the risk of ending the sport altogether.
",
15920,1,," in the 20th century, approximatelyboxers died in the ring, or shortly afterwards.
",
15921,1,," the youngest death was in a 12-year old participant.
",
15922,1,," in the first decade of this 21st century, an additionalparticipants have died as a result of their participation in boxing.
",
15923,1,," such deaths are more common in professional boxing, but deaths in amateur boxing have also been reported.
",
15924,1,," thousands more boxers have suffered permanent disfigurement, detached retinas in their eyes and various neurological complaints.
",
15925,1,," unfortunately for the sport, the most well-recognised and revered of all of its participants - mohammed ali - is now seen shuffling and mumbling as a result of parkinson’s disease which many incorrectly contribute to his boxing career.
",
15926,1,," while neurological conditions (including chronic traumatic encephalopathy - which has almost exactly the same symptoms and signs as seen with parkinson’s disease) have been reported at high rates in former boxers, ali is not one of its victims.
",
15927,1,,"despite a tightening of safety regulations, neurological and non-neurological injuries have continued with this sport.
",
15928,1,," most medical associations have policies against boxing, including the world medical association and the national bodies of the usa, britain and australia.
",
15929,1,," although the tightness of regulations upon boxing varies from country to country, and from state to state within countries, only a handful of countries have any kind of ban in place.
",
15930,1,," sweden is one country that bans professional boxing, although amateur boxing remains an olympic sport.
",
15931,1,,"as safety concerns over boxing have grown, high schools in most western countries have stopped offering it as a sport.
",
15932,1,," yet overall enthusiasm for boxing is at an all-time high; television audiences are up and record numbers of youngsters across the world are joining boxing clubs.
",
15933,1,," in britain the young olympic silver medallist amir khan, who turned professional inand quickly won the title of world super lightweight champion, is a popular hero and role model.
",
15934,1,," in a number of western countries where amateur boxing was losing popularity, especially the united states, interest has been renewed in the past ten years by the rise of women’s boxing and by white-collar boxing for office workers in their lunch-breaks.
",
15935,1,," on the other hand, the large number of organisations claiming to be world bodies for boxing (e.g. wba, wbo, ibf, etc), each with their own world champions, has damaged the credibility of the sport.
",
15936,1,," many people have also disliked the sight of aging former champions coming out of retirement in their forties or later, tempted by one last big purse.
",
15937,1,,"the arguments below ask if boxing should be banned.
",
15938,1,," most apply to both the professional and amateur sports, but the last points deal particularly with banning the professional game while leaving amateur boxing legal.
",
15939,1,," the arguments would also apply to most other forms of combat sport, for example cage-fighting.
",
15940,0,,"  unlike in any other sport , boxers intend to physically injure their opponents by knockout .
",
15941,0,," allowing people to intentionally inflict injuries upon others for public entertainment and private profit is barbaric .
",
15942,0,," children especially are trained in these ways .
",
15943,0,," when boxers turn professional , they have often already fought in at leastfights in their youth , which does not include the countless rounds of sparring during training sessions .
",
15944,0,," boxers are essentially being trained in violent ways , often at a young age .
",
15945,0,," the australian medical association actively opposes boxing for this reason , calling it , `` a public demonstration of interpersonal violence which is unique among sporting activities . ''
",
15946,0,," while there are other rough sports , boxing is different because its intent is harmful .
",
15947,0,," the world medical association , which also opposes the sport , justifies this position by noting , `` its basic intent is to produce bodily harm in the opponent . ''
",
15948,0,," boxing is a violent sport , in which youth are taught to try to hurt their peers .
",
15949,0,," it has no place in modern society .
",
15950,0,," boxers are presented as beacons of success for young people , but they are not good role models .
",
15951,0,," children should not idolize people who make a living by injuring other people .
",
15952,0,," in addition to the violence in the ring , brawls often break out at press conferences and even inside boxing venues .
",
15953,0,," the marketing of boxing exalts this mindless violence and those who perpetrate it .
",
15954,0,," mike tyson is a particularly harmful example .
",
15955,0,," tyson was one of the most popular and successful boxers in history , when he faced evander holyfield in the most hyped fight of the year .
",
15956,0,," tyson cruelly bit off a portion of holyfield 's ear in the fight , on live television .
",
15957,0,," these are not role models of which we should be proud .
",
15958,0,," when most people think of boxing -- the sport that they see on tv -- they are thinking particularly of professional boxing , which is much worse .
",
15959,0,," the main difference is that in amateur boxing the round lengths are often shorter as are the number of rounds and more protective equipment is worn .
",
15960,0,," therefore the level of exposure is minimised .
",
15961,0,," as a result ,participants out of every million die , in professional boxing , but only six per million die in amateur boxing .
",
15962,0,," that makes professional boxing more thantimes more dangerous than amateur boxing .
",
15963,0,," the fact remains , however , that professional boxing is violent , barbaric , and dangerous , so it should be banned .
",
15964,0,," the british medical association has repeatedly called for a ban on boxing or a removal of the head from the permitted target areas .
",
15965,0,," the body of medical evidence is growing that suggests even if a boxer survives individual bouts relatively unmarked , the cumulative effect of a career in boxing can lead to a greater susceptibility to chronic neurological injury .
",
15966,0,," a doctor who has studied the effect of boxing on parkinson 's specifically says that boxing causes unnecessary harm .
",
15967,0,," he writes , `` unlike most degenerative neurologic diseases , this disorder can be prevented . ''
",
15968,0,," although the incidence of injury is much higher in sports such as basketball , rugby or riding , the risk of serious injury in boxing is far greater .
",
15969,0,," that risk is so great that boxing should be banned .
",
15970,0,," a ban , quite simply , would mean fewer people dead , injured or permanently brain damaged .
",
15971,0,," to be successful , boxers have to train forhours a daydays a week , spending the best years of their lives in the gym .
",
15972,0,," because most boxers lack a formal education and spend all their time in the gym they employ managers to handle their business affairs ; very often the boxer 's entourage control the fighter 's destiny .
",
15973,0,," this relationship can be exploitative given the inequality of bargaining power and the fact that most boxers need to make as much money as they can before they are worn out .
",
15974,0,," an average boxer will have about 30-40 top-level professional bouts in them before their health and skills will dramatically deteriorate .
",
15975,0,," whilst it may well be in the fighter 's interest to hang-up his gloves , those around him have a financial incentive to push fighters into more and more title defences or comebacks .
",
15976,0,," the decisions that older boxers make provide further proof that they feel they have been exploited : over% of older boxers surveyed in chicago said that they did not want their children to be boxers .
",
15977,0,," the truth is that boxers are only treated as money-making devices by their promoters and the boxing industry .
",
15978,0,," when american boxer leavander johnson died after a fight in, his promoter told the press , `` i do n't think there 's anyone to blame here other than the circumstances .
",
15979,0,," he 's a victim of his own courage . ''
",
15980,0,," this shows promoters ' desire to exploit boxers ' `` courage '' and willingness to put themselves at risk , without having any regret for such a dangerous system .
",
15981,0,," oftentimes the promoters actively make it more dangerous , exploiting their clients for criminal ends .
",
15982,0,," in his exploration of boxing deaths throughout history , joseph svinth finds that in addition to health reasons , many deaths were criminal , with the promoter playing the dual role of `` gangster . ''
",
15983,0,," it 's time to break up this industry before any more young athletes get taken advantage of in a bad way .
",
15984,1,,"at the moment, fifa does not permit goal-line technology (glt) or video replays during matches, although it is permitted for post-match disciplinary measures.
",
15985,1,," in ameeting of the international football association board, fifa ""request[ed] the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee"".
",
15986,1,," yet despite this, controversy rages over the so-called ‘ghost’-goals that are all too frequent in the current game.
",
15987,1,," however, on wednesday 4th may, the guardian newspaper reported that fifa is set to consider the possibility of introducing goal-line technology in time for the 2012-13 season.1 it is not the first time fifa has requested that companies undergo a formal testing procedure but there is one key difference this time: they will be permitted to do so at a stadium of their own choosing.
",
15988,1,," previously, every one of the dozen or so companies who underwent the tests at fifa house had fallen foul of the short set-up time and unrealistic conditions that were imposed there.
",
15989,1,," there will be a number of strict criteria to satisfy in the two rounds of testing.
",
15990,1,," technologies must demonstrate a minimum of 90% accuracy in recognising whether both a static or a moving ball is across the line.
",
15991,1,," technologies must also inform the referee about goal-line incidents with both a vibration and a display signal to his watch, wherever he is on the pitch.
",
15992,1,," the testing will be carried out under both daylight and floodlight conditions.
",
15993,1,," the news will be welcomed by uk companies such as hawk-eye and goalminder, who are convinced that their products are already 100% accurate.
",
15994,1,," this announcement, coupled with fifas previously unrelenting stance on glt, has re-ignited the technology debate.
",
15995,0,," should glt be introduced to global football?
",
15996,0,,"football is moving into the twenty-first century , yet the refusal to embrace glt is completely out-dated .
",
15997,0,," nowhere in fifa policy does it state that referees can not use the influence of technology .
",
15998,0,," in fifas disciplinary code  , articlestates that :, `` during matches , disciplinary decisions are taken by the referee '' , and, `` these decisions are final ``.
",
15999,0,," the referee already `` acts on the advice of the assistant referees regarding incidents that he has not seen '' and can change decisions based on advice2 .
",
16000,0,," all referees also have an earpiece , introduced in, linking the two assistant refs and the fourth official , which already demonstrates technology 's successful impact in football .
",
16001,0,," glt is simply the next step .
",
16002,0,," glt technology is readily available and could be quickly implemented .
",
16003,0,," hawkeye , used in tennis and cricket , would serve the glt purpose very well .
",
16004,0,," though eventually dismissed , it was suggested that gps technology could measure whether players are offside or not .
",
16005,0,," cameras are already set up for television with enough angles to make decisions ; it would be simple to set up monitors pitch-side so that officials could watch replayed footage .
",
16006,0,," currently , viewers watching at home are able to make much more informed decisions than match officials .
",
16007,0,," goals are the ultimate measure of success in football ; technology would reduce the risk of teams losing matches unfairly due to controversial decisions , see fifa world cup quarter finalengland v germany .
",
16008,0,," there is no reason to expose referees to criticism , threats and derision when we have the means to help them .
",
16009,0,," glt is a tool meant to assist referees in their decisions , not undermine them .
",
16010,0,," howard webb has added his voice to the pro-technology debate : `` anything that makes my job easier , that makes me more credible , i 've an open mind to .
",
16011,0,," we are still using human opinion in those decisions and maybe on a matter of fact like the goal-line some technology might be the way forward .
",
16012,0,," i personally prefer it when there is no debate about the referees .
",
16013,0,," it 's a difficult position , to judge over the line .
",
16014,0,," it 's at speed , and it ai n't easy .
",
16015,0,," sometimes i feel in a less than privileged position by not having the opportunity , to use technology , but that 's where we are .
",
16016,0,," it 's for other people to decide where that argument goes .
",
16017,0,," ``
",
16018,1,,"major league baseball (mlb), often referred to as “america’s pastime,” is unlike some other sports because it largely disallowing the use of instant replay to determine whether an umpire’s call was correct.
",
16019,1,,"  unlike american football—which allows videos of any play to be reviewed and, potentially, for officials’ calls to be reversed—baseball uses instant replay only for “boundary calls” involving potential home runs (in questions of whether a struck ball was a home run or a foul, or in situations where it’s unclear whether a fan interfered with a potential home run).
",
16020,1,,"  though the decision to adopt this limited degree of instant replay was a watershed in baseball history, many are calling for the sport to embrace instant replay more thoroughly by permitting it in a wider variety of situations.
",
16021,1,,"  it has been reported that mlb officials are considering this expansion for the coming season.
",
16022,1,,"though the push for instant replay has existed for years and seems to grow stronger whenever there is a high-profile mistake by an umpire, it reached unprecedented intensity after a notorious blown call in june 2010.
",
16023,1,,"  detroit tigers pitcher armando galarraga was one out away from a perfect game—among the rarest and most revered accomplishments in baseball—against the cleveland indians when the umpire incorrectly ruled a runner safe at first base.
",
16024,1,,"  video footage showed beyond any doubt that the umpire blew the call and that galarraga had been wrongly deprived of a place in baseball history.
",
16025,1,,"instant replay advocates differ in how they believe the sport should adopt the practice—for example, whether it should be limited to certain types of plays, or whether there should be a time limit.
",
16026,1,,"  though these are important questions, many arguments in this debate do not hinge on the specific mechanics of the instant replay used.
",
16027,0,," the main goal of an umpire is to make accurate calls .
",
16028,0,," umpires are meant to ensure that a player who is out is called out , for example , and that a foul ball is ruled a foul ball .
",
16029,0,," when an umpire makes an incorrect call , he is falling short of fulfilling his primary responsibility .
",
16030,0,," as the official rules of major league baseball instruct umpires , `` the first requisite is to get decisions correctly ... umpire dignity is important but never as important as ` being right ''' , official baseball rules , rule 9.05 .
",
16031,0,," without a doubt , instant replay helps to improve the accuracy of calls .
",
16032,0,," when a play can be reviewed after the fact , in slow-motion , from multiple angles , it 's almost inevitable that the result will be a more accurate judgment .
",
16033,0,," instant replay serves as an additional tool for umpires , allowing closer examination of events .
",
16034,0,," by providing umpires with an extra set of eyes , video cameras will better enable umps to fulfil their purpose .
",
16035,0,," umpires must make split-second judgments , often from bad angles and with many elements to watch simultaneously .
",
16036,0,," mistakes will happen .
",
16037,0,," even the official rules acknowledge this when it tells umpires , `` you no doubt are going to make mistakes '' , official baseball rules , rule 9.05 .
",
16038,0,," some calls will have to be made from a significant distance away from where the umpire is located -- a commonly cited justification of mlb 's adoption of instant replay on boundary calls .
",
16039,0,," fans hold umpires to an exceptionally high standard ; as former umpire nestor chylak put it , `` they expect an umpire to be perfect on opening day and to improve as the season goes on . ''
",
16040,0,," but it is impossible for a human to attain perfection on his own , so we should provide him with the tools that will enable him to meet the exacting standards set out for him .
",
16041,0,," it is folly to withhold technology that is already available .
",
16042,0,," even mlb commissioner bud selig , generally an opponent of instant replay , acknowledged `` that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis '' when he announced its adoption on boundary calls .
",
16043,0,," just as we would never countenance a rule prohibiting umpires from wearing eyeglasses to see calls better , we should also not tolerate a rule that essentially keeps umpires blind to a reality that everyone else -- reporters , coaches , and fans -- has access to .
",
16044,0,," well-respected sports illustrate columnist joe posnanski captured this point well : `` baseball ... should institute replay because it 's just not sustainable in today 's technological world to make bad calls on the field .
",
16045,0,," those days are over ... you ca n't keep giving the fans at home better access to the truth than the home plate umpire . ''
",
16046,0,," instant replay is a necessary tool to help umpires `` see '' better .
",
16047,0,," instant replay will lead fans , managers , and players to hold umpires in higher regard .
",
16048,0,," this will occur in two ways .
",
16049,0,," first , the vast majority of umpires ' calls are accurate .
",
16050,0,," statistical analyses have shown that well overpercent of calls are accurate , but this is not always appreciated by spectators .
",
16051,0,," instant replay will often confirm umpires ' calls , which will call to the public 's attention just how often umpires get it right .
",
16052,0,," second , in cases where umpires ' incorrect judgments could have very bad consequences -- for example , in the case of armando galarraga 's ruined perfect game , or in deciding the outcome of a crucial game -- instant replay will allow a reversal .
",
16053,0,," this will spare the umpire much guilt and shame .
",
16054,0,," umpire tim mcclelland , who was involved in questionable calls during theplayoffs , said as much about his experience and those of jim joyce , the umpire who blew galarraga 's perfect game : `` after watching what i went through in the playoffs last year and then what jim 's going through , i think more and more umpires are coming around to , increased use of replay . ''
",
16055,0,," former umpire don denkinger expressed a similar sentiment .
",
16056,0,," he blew a call in gameof theworld series , and probably changed the outcome of the entire season .
",
16057,0,," `` i hadgreat years ... and i had one call that 's all anybody ever wants to talk about .
",
16058,0,," it 's not right , '' he said , adding that he now supports instant replay .
",
16059,0,," umpires are supposed to facilitate a smooth game .
",
16060,0,," when they are the center of attention , it is usually because something has gone wrong .
",
16061,0,," legendary hall of fame umpire bill klem accurately stated , `` the best umpired game is the game in which the fans can not recall the umpires who worked it . ''
",
16062,0,," the game is supposed to be decided by the feats of the players on the field , not the fallibility of the men in blue .
",
16063,0,," instant replay will help make this happen .
",
16064,0,," with instant replay , we would not have had jim joyce , the umpire who blew galarraga 's perfect game , holding a tearful press conference apologizing for his missed call .
",
16065,0,," instead , we would have had images of galarraga celebrating his historical achievement with his teammates .
",
16066,0,," the latter , not the former , is what baseball is supposed to be about , and what fans want to see .
",
16067,0,," instant replay will ensure that baseball revolves around the players , rather than the officials .
",
16068,0,," there are times when umpires make incorrect calls that determine the outcomes of games or , worse , world series championships , e.g. , don denkinger and theworld series , mentioned above .
",
16069,0,," these erroneous decisions lead to the team that deserved to win actually losing , and vice versa .
",
16070,0,," in short , the results of the games are illegitimate .
",
16071,0,," this is especially unfortunate when fans invest hours to watch a game , or hundreds of hours watching an entire season , only to see the wrong outcome -- which could have been entirely avoidable if umpires were allowed to review their decision .
",
16072,1,,"major league baseball (mlb), often referred to as “america’s national pastime,” differs from some other team sports—such as american football, rugby, and ice hockey—in largely seeking to avoid forceful physical contact between players.
",
16073,1,,"  the rules of baseball largely prohibit players from attempting to crash into or otherwise physically incapacitate opponents.
",
16074,1,,"  there is, however, one notable exception: collisions at home plate.
",
16075,1,,"these collisions occur when a runner attempts to score by reaching home plate before the catcher (the defensive player responsible for covering home) receives a throw from elsewhere on the field and tags the runner out.
",
16076,1,,"  a catcher is permitted to block the path of the runner trying to score if the catcher has the baseball in his possession or if he is about to receive a throw.
",
16077,1,,"  (otherwise, the catcher may not block home plate.)
",
16078,1,,"  runners, in turn, are permitted to collide with the catcher in order to reach home plate, or to jar the ball loose from the catcher’s possession; either of those outcomes would allow the runner to score.
",
16079,1,,"catchers wear protective gear, including a chest protector, helmet, and shin guards (though they tend to remove their face mask when receiving throws, supposedly because it limits their range of vision).
",
16080,1,,"  runners have only a helmet, though they tend to be running at top speed at the time of a collision, whereas the catcher is stationary and sometimes is unable to observe the runner’s approach because his attention is focused on receiving the throw.
",
16081,1,,"these collisions at home plate have occasionally resulted in serious injury.
",
16082,1,,"  when injuries occur, they are usually—though not always—to the catcher.
",
16083,1,,"  famously, hall of fame player pete rose barrelled into catcher ray fosse in theall star game.
",
16084,1,,"  fosse was injured and was never the same player again, but the collision allowed rose to score the winning run.
",
16085,1,,"  more recently, in may 2011, the san francisco giants’ star catcher buster posey suffered a gruesome, season-ending leg injury when he was hit by scott cousins of the florida marlins.
",
16086,1,,"  cousins scored, helping the marlins win the game.
",
16087,1,,"  but the images of posey’s injury sparked a debate about whether such collisions should be permitted.
",
16088,1,,"those who oppose crashes differ in precisely how they would change the rules, but the most common proposal is to require the runner to slide, just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases.
",
16089,1,,"  another option is to disallow catchers to block runners’ paths.
",
16090,1,,"  most of the arguments in this debate do not depend on the specific proposal.
",
16091,0,," baseball is a form of entertainment , and few plays are as entertaining as bang-bang plays , a close call on whether the runner is thrown out , at the plate .
",
16092,0,," as a sport that 's often criticized for being too slow and boring -- `` baseball has no clock , '' the saying goes -- it 's important that it hold onto perhaps the most dramatic , vivid play it has to offer .
",
16093,0,," one columnist described it this way : `` when , collisions , do occur , they 're exciting .
",
16094,0,," we watch to see how well the catcher blocks the plate , how hard the runner slides , and whether the catcher can hold the ball .
",
16095,0,," as dangerous as that play may be , it 's exciting to watch . ''
",
16096,0,," other sports -- like american football , ice hockey , and rugby -- feature plenty of violent hits .
",
16097,0,," baseball has so few of them that when they do happen , they are doubly entertaining .
",
16098,0,," it is just not necessary for baseball to prohibit a small dose of something that is extremely common in other sports .
",
16099,0,," first , collisions are part of the tradition of baseball .
",
16100,0,," they have been part of the game for a very long time .
",
16101,0,," fans , players , and managers all expect home plate hits to occur from time to time .
",
16102,0,," `` some things are part of the game .
",
16103,0,," there 's not a whole lot you can do , '' said red sox catcher jason varitek , who has been on the receiving end of numerous crashes in his career .
",
16104,0,," varitek 's manager at the time , terry francona , agreed : `` nobody wants to see anybody get hurt , but you got to play the game . ''
",
16105,0,," and former catcher brad ausmus , who had also been hit multiple times in his career , echoed the sentiment : `` , i , t 's part of the game .
",
16106,0,," ... when you put on the shin guards and chest protector , you know that if there 's a play at the plate and you 're blocking the plate , you could take a hit at any moment . ''
",
16107,0,," as the associated press put it , many people believe `` home plate collisions are as much a part of baseball tradition as peanuts and cracker jacks and the seventh-inning stretch . ''
",
16108,0,," second , home plate hits are an essential element of playing the game hard .
",
16109,0,," without them , baseball would be much less deserving of its nickname `` hardball . ''
",
16110,0,," one commentator notes , `` , an injury is , extremely unfortunate , but it 's the result of a hard-nosed play that is as old as the game itself .
",
16111,0,," to take away the potential for a high-intensity , physical play in an otherwise non-physical sport would be a mistake . ''
",
16112,0,," in that vein , collisions are also part of the dynamic between the offense and defense that , once removed , will make the game much poorer : `` a baserunner wants to get there at all costs , whereas a catcher wants to protect it at all costs .
",
16113,0,," the mutual discomfort that 's evoked in both the catcher and the baserunner as a play at the plate develops is one of the intriguing peculiarities that makes the game of baseball so great . ''
",
16114,0,," some hits lead to injury , but the vast majority do not .
",
16115,0,," one commentator challenged proponents of a rule change `` to name as many as five mlb catchers in the lastyears who have had their careers ended or shortened as a result of a home plate collision .
",
16116,0,," personally , i ca n't think of one . ''
",
16117,0,," in posing some -- though not a substantial -- risk , home plate collisions are very much like other aspects of the sport .
",
16118,0,," every time a pitcher throws a pitch , the batter could get struck and hurt .
",
16119,0,," every time two outfielders converge on a fly ball , there 's a risk of injury .
",
16120,0,," baseball , as with many other sports , inherently involves the risk of injury .
",
16121,0,," it makes little sense to focus on this play , which does n't often result in significant injury .
",
16122,0,," moreover , catchers are trained to position their bodies in ways that minimize the injury risk from crashes .
",
16123,0,," if catchers do as they 're trained , they 're very unlikely to get hurt .
",
16124,0,," there are two often-discussed ways to change the rules : require the runner to slide , just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases ; or disallow catchers to block runners ' paths .
",
16125,0,," each results in an imbalance between the catcher and runner .
",
16126,0,," a commentator describes this dynamic very well : `` if major league baseball was to employ a rule stating that runners must avoid contact with the catcher -- similar to the ` slide or avoid ' rule employed in amateur baseball -- it would give the advantage to the catcher .
",
16127,0,," the catcher would have the benefit of dictating the course of action that a baserunner must take , and would -- perhaps more importantly -- have peace of mind knowing that there is no chance of an ensuing collision .
",
16128,0,," if major league baseball was to make a rule stating that the catcher can not block the plate , the advantage would certainly go to the baserunner , who would enjoy the luxury of a straight path to the most sacred ground on a baseball diamond . ''
",
16129,0,," allowing collisions is the fairest , most even match between the catcher and runner .
",
16130,1,,"college football is the only major sport, collegiate and professional, that does not have a standard playoff at the end of the season to determine a champion.
",
16131,1,," the creation of the bowl championship series (bcs) inwas intended to cure some of these problems, by offering up a tiered system of bowl-games that matched equivalently seeded teams against each other, and which matched up - supposedly - the two best teams in the country against one another in the national championship.
",
16132,1,," specifically, there are five championships “bowls” meaning ten teams are selected for these championships.
",
16133,1,," the ten teams selected include the six conference champions from selected automatically qualifying conferences and four others.
",
16134,1,," the top two of these ten are then selected for the national championship.
",
16135,1,,"yet, this system has been met with significant criticism over the years, particularly from the supporters of teams that have gone undefeated, and yet who have not received an invitation to play in the bcs championship.
",
16136,1,," an undefeated auburn was denied such a chance in 2004, boise state’s undefeatedseason - which included a win over heavily-favoured oklahoma in the fiesta bowl - was not worthy to be rewarded with a shot at the national championship, and utah's undefeated team inwas also denied a chance.
",
16137,1,," supporters of these teams and others have argued that a playoff - which would likely take the form oforteams - would give a fairer chance to such teams to demonstrate that they are the rightful national champions.
",
16138,1,," the idea has gained so much support over the years that a bill was drafted in the senate incalled the college football playoffs act of 2009.
",
16139,1,," president-elect barack obama gave support to the idea of an 8-team playoff shortly after his election, saying, ""i’m going to throw my weight around a little bit, ""i think it’s the right thing to do.
",
16140,1,,"""buoyed by such support, the idea of college football playoffs continues to gain momentum, with debate becoming increasingly intense.
",
16141,0,," the bcs system unfairly discriminates againstof theteams that participate in college football .
",
16142,0,," given that some of these teams participate in non-bcs leagues they can perform incredibly well and still not get into the bcs .
",
16143,0,," further , the bcs system is flawed beyond this given that both boise state and utah were deemed unsuitable for the competition despite the fact that they went undefeated in the seasons before their rejection .
",
16144,0,," the winner of the bcs is meant to be the best collegiate football team in the country .
",
16145,0,," however , if undefeated teams are unable to compete it makes the system incredibly unfair , and reduces the legitimacy of the bcs title itself , undermining the value of the competition overall .
",
16146,0,," finally , as noted football analyst michael shull notes , due to flaws in the computer algorithms used to allocated bcs places , some teams that do well for a single season as an outlier or due to a positive change for the team do not get into the cup .
",
16147,0,," this potentially means that the same teams consistently get into the cup and gain $million in revenue regardless of whether they win or lose .
",
16148,0,," as such this system ensures that those who do get selected just get richer and better and thus become more likely to be picked by the computer system in the future .
",
16149,0,," within the playoff system every game during the playoffs is a knockout .
",
16150,0,," as such , every single game in the playoffs carries the potential risk of excluding the losing team from the remainder of that season 's games .
",
16151,0,," this works incredibly well to build up tension , because favourites have lost to teams that were believed to be a lot worse .
",
16152,0,," with history supporting this idea all players and fans are likely to feel tension during the playoff games which directly contributes to the enjoyment of a game .
",
16153,0,," further , given the prevalence of late game comebacks in american football , due the ever present threat of an interception , it means that fans are still likely to enjoy games even when their team is likely to lose going into the later quarters .
",
16154,0,," further , the playoff system still significantly incentivises good work during the regular season .
",
16155,0,," the top ranked team would face the lowest ranked team in the first round and gain home field advantage for being the higher seed .
",
16156,0,," it is beneficial for both sides because under bcs , the second team has no guarantee that it would even be included and the former team would not be guaranteed home field advantage .
",
16157,0,," the issue with the bcs system , as mentioned above , is that teams selected by an often broken and biased bcs mechanism receive more money and exposure than more talented , harder working institutions , making them more likely to be selected by the same mechanism in the future .
",
16158,0,," standout teams that only perform that well for a season are able to get significantly more exposure under the proposition model .
",
16159,0,," due to the very high profile nature of playoff games - as well as the fact that there would simply be more playoff games with palpably fair and meritocratic outcomes later in the playoffs - more people will watch college football .
",
16160,0,," specifically , including more teams in a playoff based competition will mean that more fans get their favourites in to the playoffs and as such more people watch .
",
16161,0,," secondly , the increased number of matches ' means that it is more likely that fans will be able to catch another match if they can not watch one .
",
16162,0,," finally , should an upset happen , the amount of interest generated in the subsequent match is incredibly great and generates significantly more exposure for both teams participating .
",
16163,1,,"the world of sport is almost entirely divided between men’s and women’s categories.
",
16164,1,," however men’s sport has always dominated all forms of media coverage despite the fact that women also compete in those exact same sport (increasingly on a professional level).
",
16165,1,," this includes live broadcasting, newspaper and internet articles and reports, news coverage etc. for example, in the usa women’s sports receive a total of 1.6% of sports airtime on local tv and sports media giant espn.
",
16166,1,," [1] a similar story is noticed in australian sports media where women’s sports coverage totalled 9% compared to 81% on men’s sports.
",
16167,1,," [2] in the written press the numbers are similarly skewed.
",
16168,1,," betweenand 2009,articles were published on women’s football in the british press.
",
16169,1,," putting this into context, in the same time spanarticles were published on coventry city fc (a lower league british club) alone.
",
16170,1,," [3] what’s important to note with the examples given is that they are all taken from countries that have a relatively large participation and interest in women’s sports.
",
16171,1,," paradoxically, although the level of participation of girls and women in sport has increased significantly over the past decades this does not appear to have transposed onto increased airtime for women’s sports.
",
16172,1,," indeed some studies have shown the opposite has occurred and the gap in coverage between men’s and women’s sport has widened.
",
16173,0,," [4] the only notable exceptions to the male domination in the world of sport are in the olympic games where coverage is equal irrespective of gender, and to a lesser extent grand slam tennis where coverage is roughly equal but the men’s competitions still carry more prestige.
",
16174,0,,"sport is dominated by a male-orientated world view .
",
16175,0,," this is the case in two respects : this male dominated world-view is unfair on female athletes .
",
16176,0,," sport is supposed to be a celebration of the human mind and body , and it is right that athletes that push themselves to the brink in search for glory receive due praise .
",
16177,0,," the hugely skewed coverage of sport against women 's sports caused by the male world-view in the media is hugely unfair on female athletes , as they do not get the deserved recognition their male counterparts receive .
",
16178,0,," the male world-view which dominates sports media and conveys to the public that women 's sport are inferior to men 's reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and deter young girls from becoming active in sport .
",
16179,0,," gender perceptions have obviously come a long way in the lastyears , but the media classification of women 's sport as inferior to men 's is severely slowing this progress in the field of sport .
",
16180,0,," humans are social beings with esteem needs , and as social beings we like to be viewed in a positive light by our peers .
",
16181,0,," this is best achieved on a general level by conforming to social expectations and norm .
",
16182,0,," this also applies for societal conceptions of gender .
",
16183,0,," the fact that the media deems women 's sport to be of lesser importance which , as we have seen , conveys to the public this message , reinforces the notion that sport is not a worthwhile activity for women and girls .
",
16184,0,," instead , it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys .
",
16185,0,," this kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves .
",
16186,0,," in this way , the lack of media coverage of women 's sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one 's ability ; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do .
",
16187,0,,"  by forcing the media to provide equal coverage of both men 's and women 's sport , we take an effective step in breaking these societal discourses and transforming gender perceptions .
",
16188,0,," this is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women .
",
16189,0,," as more women take part in sport , this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which , in turn , induces further women to become engaged in sport .
",
16190,0,," this is a desirable outcome from the government 's perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active .
",
16191,0,," those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like coronary heart disease and cancer , but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising , and the joy of feeling physically fit .
",
16192,0,," a more obvious problem with the limited coverage of women 's sport is the distinct lack of sports role models available as sources of inspiration for girls .
",
16193,0,," having sports role models is crucial for children to attain the desire and motivation to partake in sport .
",
16194,0,," boys often want to be like lionel messi in football , or lebron james in basketball .
",
16195,0,," boys can access such figureheads because they are world famous .
",
16196,0,," their sporting achievements and prowess are glorified in all forms of media and people can very easily watch them play their sport live on tv .
",
16197,0,," the same does not exist for girls because female athletes receive nowhere near as much media attention as their male counterparts .
",
16198,0,," girls often ca n't even name any female sports stars so lack role models in sport .
",
16199,0,,"  although it is true that children can have role models of either sex , the divide in the sports world between men 's and women 's sports means girls can not aspire to compete alongside the likes of usain bolt or michael phelps .
",
16200,0,," the successes of british female athletes like rebecca adlington , jessica ennis and victoria pendleton , or the young katie ledecky from the usa in the recent olympics have captured the hearts and imagination of a huge number of young girls across the uk and already , as local sports centres and athletics clubs have seen participation amongst girls soar during and after the london olympics .
",
16201,0,," this is no coincidence -- it is because of the media attention and glorification female athletes receive .
",
16202,0,," the olympic games are an example of what equal media coverage of men 's and women 's sport can achieve , the equal coverage of grand slam tennis and the subsequent glorification of the likes of maria sharapova and serena williams is another example .
",
16203,0,," we must take action to provide the same sort of role models across all sporting events .
",
16204,0,," increased media coverage will lead to more money going into women 's sport .
",
16205,0,," this will happen for several reasons .
",
16206,0,," increased government funding is desirable because it leads to better facilities and coaching , increased public awareness , increased participation and , ultimately , in improved results on the sporting field , as was seen in both beijing and london for team gb .
",
16207,1,,"pierre de coubertin, the founder of the modern olympic movement, developed in the early 20th century a set of universal principles – or values – that, he intended, encompassed all olympic games: respect, excellence and friendship (london 2012).
",
16208,1,," his principles were born out of the international olympic committees motto of ‘citius, altius, fortius’ – faster, higher, stronger (allen, 2011).
",
16209,1,," the values were intended to apply to all competing athletes but eventually permeate into society and education.
",
16210,1,,"fast forward toin atlanta, an olympics marred by the growth of corporate sponsorship, a bombing that gave the event a political edge and a widespread belief that, even if they were not caught, doping was rife among athletes.
",
16211,1,," each of the following olympics has followed a similar path, away from the ideals of de coubertin and the values that have ensured the longevity of the event.
",
16212,1,," proponents argue drugs now overshadow remarkable performances, the voting process is accused of bribery and pandering to the interests of its most senior officials whilst studies indicate the youth are more uninspired by the event than ever before.
",
16213,1,," opponents of the motion maintain however that ultimately sport wins out, that the olympic dream is forever maintained by the application and dedication of its athletes; countries and athletes continue to flock to the event because of what it represents and that history will not be overshadowed by political posturing or drug scandals.
",
16214,1,," though the olympic games will continue to be the world’s premier sporting event, the debate concerns whether the modern olympics still carries the dream and ideals of its antecedents?
",
16215,0,," the massive commercialisation of the games erodes the idea of taking part for its own sake : with so much sponsorship money at stake , winning at all costs is the inevitable aim .
",
16216,0,," the rule of the sponsors seems more important than the sport : interrupting television coverage of the events to advertise is symptomatic of this , permitting mcdonalds to sponsor a sports event is another .
",
16217,0,," as is the auctioning off of ` virtually every aspect of the games to the highest bidder . '
",
16218,0,," 1 whilst a recent report indicates that sport is still at the centre of the olympics , ` the volume of commercial messages drowns out any competing narratives apart from sports ' , multinational monitor  p..
",
16219,0,," the olympic dream is that competing narrative attempting to weave the values of friendship , respect and excellence into the home viewer .
",
16220,0,," furthermore , corporate sponsorship concentrates on the richest countries ' athletes .
",
16221,0,," the united states , for example , benefits from huge funding from overcorporations for its team and can thus train them to far higher levels than developing countries can , multinational monitor  .
",
16222,0,," as one of these 100-plus companies , citi paid $million purely to be the ` official bank of theunited states olympic team ' , belson  .
",
16223,0,," this prevents competition on an equal footing , one feature of the olympic dream .
",
16224,0,," the use of performance-enhancing drugs is sufficiently common in the olympics to be a cause of concern .
",
16225,0,," not only do they reduce the victories of those who take them to meaninglessness but they cast aspersions over the efforts of all other athletes .
",
16226,0,," as simon barnes noted in beijing in, `` the world is full of people declaring that they do n't care who wins what at the olympics , because ` they 're all on something ''' , barnes  .
",
16227,0,," new drugs such as the growth hormone epo are very difficult to detect , and the olympic authorities are not doing enough to overcome the problem -- stirring the negative public opinion .
",
16228,0,," though the ioc claims to be clamping down on the drug problem , there were stillcases of doping at athens in, andcases in beijing , allen  , such cases only indicate the athletes taking known substances , or substances that can be tested for .
",
16229,0,," the olympic motto of ` faster , higher , stronger ' is fatally undermined if athletes ' achievements are the result not of physical and mental strain , but chemical concoction .
",
16230,0,," the ioc and many national olympic committees lack integrity , and this kills the games ' spirit and pretensions to fair play .
",
16231,0,," officials working for the salt lake citybid are believed to have spent more than $million on ` gifts and favors ' for ioc members in an effort to bribe their way to the victory .1 furthermore , in response to a bbc programme inwhich highlighted the corruption of members of fifa , football 's governing body , the ioc was forced to open an investigation into three of its own members who held posts at both organizations .2 the inability of the ioc to stamp out the corruption of its own members , or otherwise alter its voting system , reflects poorly on its commitment to excellence and fairness .
",
16232,0,," if the ioc is charged with ensuring the propagation of the olympic dream , it is setting a poor example .
",
16233,0,," the modern olympic athlete is no longer driven ` for the glory of sport ' , but by an appetite for excellence that can , and often does , override any notion of fair-play or respect .
",
16234,0,," the sense of fraternity that olympic athletes once had is becoming lost in the antagonistic rivalries between nations and individual athletes and the pressure not merely to compete , but to win .
",
16235,0,," we should have some sympathy with athletes sometimes : very often , they are compelled to take drugs by their team 's coach .
",
16236,0,," the chinese swimming team , for example , was beset at atlanta by claims that they had adopted a systematic and untraceable doping regime to improve their athletes , with remarkable results .1 to overcome this , the ioc conference in februaryrecommended that coaches should take the olympic oath as well as athletes , however the document itself is so tarnished by the regularity with which it is ignored that it is fast becoming a farce .
",
16237,0,," the olympics therefore may still be a great event , with many great athletes but it no longer carries the associations with respect and fair-play that made its dream so appealing to so many .
",
16238,0,," the olympics have been hijacked so many times for political purposes that competition `` for the glory of sport '' can not help but have been smothered .
",
16239,0,," the munich disaster inis the most shocking : nine israeli athletes were taken hostage by palestinian terrorists and eventually killed .
",
16240,0,," yet the games were only suspended forhours ; it is as if those who play the games were less important than the spectacle of the games .
",
16241,0,," when the usa boycotted themoscow games , they devalued still further the supremacy of sport for its own sake .
",
16242,0,," in, a number of state leaders decided to boycott the beijing opening ceremony in protest of the chinese crackdown in tibet .1 in so doing , they essentially pull the focus of the event away from the athletes and sport and use it instead as a political tool .
",
16243,0,," that is not the purpose of an event founded specifically to grant athletes the platform to shine .
",
16244,1,,"the united kingdom is generally seen as the birthplace of football (soccer) as the world currently knows it today.
",
16245,1,," the first formal set of rules were drawn up in the uk by the football association in 1863, the first official international game took place inbetween scotland and england in glasgow and the world's first football league was setup in england in 1888.
",
16246,1,," but despite being the birthplace of the sport the united kingdom does not currently field a football team in the olympic games.
",
16247,1,," every four years the debate rages as to whether the uk should field a team in the sport in which it created, however with theolympics being awarded to the united kingdom inthe debate has become much fiercer than usual.
",
16248,1,,"the core reason there has not been a uk olympic football team for overyears, despite it being the number one sport in the uk, is that the four countries which make up the united kingdom; england, scotland, wales and northern ireland, each have separate independent football bodies, footballing leagues as well as currently playing as separate footballing nations in the fifa world cup and uefa european cup competitions.
",
16249,0,," so should the united kingdom form a combined team for the olympics or are the obstacles for this to happen too great?
",
16250,0,,"due to the rules around olympic football in regards to qualifying , which make it impossible for the united kingdom to qualify , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for footballers of the uk to play olympic football .
",
16251,0,," to enter the event there is a qualification round , in europe the uefa under-21 championship event is not only a stand-alone competition it is also used for olympic qualification1 ; as uk nations enter this competition as separate teams it means that the uk can not normally enter the olympic event as they would technically have four chances to qualify whereas each other country has only one .
",
16252,0,," however , as the uk is the host nation of theolympics it gains automatic qualification for all the events at the games , including football , which it would usually be illegible to enter .
",
16253,0,," the home nations should pull together and enter a unified team to the olympics as it is quite literally a once in a lifetime opportunity to have any team from the uk playing olympic football , to not enter a team despite having qualification is quite unheard of and as the uk is the home of football it would be a vast disappointment if the uk did not enter .
",
16254,0,," the olympics is meant to represent the top of each sport and for the uk not to enter a team for what is the most popular sport in the country seems an odd state of affairs .
",
16255,0,," one of the major barriers of the uk entering a team into the olympics has been gaining the permission of fifa , whose stance has traditionally been that the uk can not play as separate nations in fifa and uefa football tournaments and then come together for the olympics as one team , they must be either entirely together or entirely separate .
",
16256,0,," however as theolympics are being held in london , fifa has officially sanctioned the creation of a one-off uk team for theolympics only .
",
16257,0,," sepp blatter , the fifa president , has personally stated ' a british olympic football team would not affect at all the privileges of the four british associations as members of fifa '.
",
16258,0,," the barriers of creating a uk team then are therefore lower than ever and it should be acted upon .
",
16259,0,," the act of union demonstrated the nations of the uk can pull together , and for this one-off uk-based event the footballing associations should put their differences aside and seize this opportunity while the barriers to its creation remain historically low .
",
16260,0,," if there is any attempt in the future to use this union as proof that the nations should permanently join , the independent football bodies would simply be able to point to or lean on fifa 's permission ; the explicit sanctioning of the uk team for londonis all the assurance necessary to compete without fear of repercussions .
",
16261,0,," the olympic creed states that `` the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle .
",
16262,0,," the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well .
",
16263,0,," ``as the uk is the host nation of the olympics init should now , more than any other time really follow this creed and take part in all the events particularly as they have the opportunity to do so having got automatic qualification for all the events ; not doing so would be undermine the olympic ideal .
",
16264,0,," a uk football team would be good for national unity .
",
16265,0,," by giving allmillion people in great britain and northern ireland the same team to cheer for , it will make them feel more united .
",
16266,0,," sincewales , scotland and northern ireland have been given a lot of political power over their own affairs .
",
16267,0,," this is good but there is a danger that we lose sight of our common british identity and the government is keen to find ways of promoting britishness ,2 including a british football team .
",
16268,1,,"with the olympics fast approaching, we must ask, what is the price of gold?
",
16269,1,," professional athletes already sacrifice huge amounts in order to earn the ultimate prize, but some athletes endure untold hardships and abuse to get there.
",
16270,1,," particularly prevalent in gymnastics but present in other sports, athletes have been beaten, starved, physically and mentally abused and forced into unusually cruel and inhospitable environments in the name of ‘training’.
",
16271,1,,"  these allegations tend to be directed towards romania, china and russia, although scandals have hit other countries.
",
16272,1,," this house asks, should we allow this to go on?
",
16273,1,," if not, is banning countries from participating if they do opt to subject their athletes to these methods the fairest or most successful means of tackling the issue?
",
16274,1,,"if the policy were to come into place, it’d likely come from the international association of athletics federation (iaaf), who are the central body who currently rule upon international athletics.
",
16275,1,," the policy would ban nations found guilty of using these techniques, indefinitely, until investigations are complete and evidence of reform is shown.
",
16276,1,," that would be a definite change from the status quo where trainers are rarely exposed, and when they are, very little tends to happen.
",
16277,1,," for example, despite the famous gymnastic coaches, béla and márta károlyi, receiving multiple accusations of abuse, the couple are still prominent members of the gymnastics community and marta károlyi is the current usa team coordinator.
",
16278,1,," under this rule, if the karolyis were found guilty, the nation they coached would be banned from competing in the upcoming games and it’d be the responsibility of the nation to put in the necessary procedures to ensure abuses don’t happen again.
",
16279,1,," the definition could go ‘hard-line’ and ban the entire country, including athletes who aren’t in the team where the abuses occurred, or could focus bans upon individual national teams.
",
16280,1,," for example, if abuses were found in the australian javelin team, you could either ban the javelin team from the olympics, or the entire nation of australia and all their teams.
",
16281,1,," let’s assume we’re going hardline.
",
16282,1,,"the policy is drastic, but so are the scandals and allegations of abuse.
",
16283,1,," so, how do we proceed?
",
16284,0,," this measure introduces a strong deterrent against those who allow and facilitate abusive training methods .
",
16285,0,," firstly , it incentivises national athletic and sporting bodies to diligently check the background of coaches before their employment and continue to investigate them throughout the year .
",
16286,0,," it is now in the interest of every single member of national sporting bodies and teams to ensure abuse does n't continue .
",
16287,0,," in most it is currently in your interest to keep quiet , lest you risk disturbing the national programme or being ostracised by your federation .
",
16288,0,," as a result coaches are far less likely to think these training methods will help them achieve success .
",
16289,0,," since it could see their athletes banned from the competition and lose their medals it makes using harsh training methods an immense risk to take .
",
16290,0,," it would also mean they 're unlikely to ever get hired again if caught .
",
16291,0,," this ban is , admittedly , highly punitive and may be called harsh .
",
16292,0,," it will punish hundreds of athletes and coaches who are n't implicated in cases of abuse .
",
16293,0,," yet , on a balance of harms , the disappointment those people feel ca n't be compared to the suffering of an athlete who is beaten and starved and conditioned into a mode of thinking where they accept this without putting up a fight .
",
16294,0,," according to melanie lang of metropolitan university harsh and over intensive training `` removes the element of fun that first attracts so many youngsters to sport .
",
16295,0,," it can inhibit bone growth , cause physical and mental burnout and increase the potential for injury and dropout . ''
",
16296,0,," and worse the coercion can lead to injury and even death ; american gymnast christy henrich became anorexic and as a result died weighing only 3st 5lb while chinese gymnast sang lan was paralysed after being cajoled into attempting a vault .
",
16297,0,," it 's more important to ensure all athletes can train in a safe environment free from physical and mental abuse , than it is to safeguard against the disappointment of professional athletes who want to compete .
",
16298,0,," given that there are major sporting events annually or bi-annually , usually , it 's not as if those forced to miss out ca n't compete again soon .
",
16299,0,," athletes dedicate their lives to their sport and becoming the world 's best at what they do .
",
16300,0,," they are willing to put their body and minds through all sorts of punishment to do this .
",
16301,0,," as such , they 're not in a position to judge what is and is n't an acceptable training method .
",
16302,0,," if they 're told that starvation makes them more likely to win gold then their intense desire for olympic glory often clouds their judgment and ability to make rational choices for themselves .
",
16303,0,," their coaches are authority figures who assumed to have their best interests in mind , and most athletes also assume their coaches know more than them about how to achieve glory .
",
16304,0,," so , if a gymnastics coach tells her athlete that she needs to starve herself to win gold , the athlete will think themselves a bad athlete if they refuse .
",
16305,0,," this is shown by the long history of drug use in the olympics where both coaches and athletes know it is wrong to use drugs but still do so in the hope it will bring them gold .
",
16306,0,," because of this , the iaff has to make this decision for them .
",
16307,0,," it also means that the chance of whistleblowing is low , since athletes can not rationally consider whether the training methods are acceptable .
",
16308,0,," so it has to set an incredibly punitive deterrent to make sure coaches are n't tempted to use a training method they probably wo n't be caught for .
",
16309,0,," just as an employer has a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees , the iaaf has a duty to provide a safe environment for their athletes .
",
16310,0,," the sports medical team is responsible for ` preventing illness and injury ' , clearly something that is caused by harsh training .
",
16311,0,," as do all those who are involved in sports .
",
16312,0,," these athletes only exist in a professional capacity because bodies created the positions for the athletes to exist .
",
16313,0,," if the world wants to pay people to perform and compete for them , then once that offer is made they have a moral duty to ensure that work is safe , since they are culpable in creating that work .
",
16314,0,," moreover , we give the iaaf power in the promise that by giving up localised power of judgement over sport , they can better protect athletes and creating a fairer sporting environment .
",
16315,0,," abusive training methods are a huge failure on the part of the iaaf and as such they must use the most powerful disincentive possible to them .
",
16316,1,,"sports events have often played host to gestures designed to make political points.
",
16317,1,," holding as they do worldwide media attention, they act as a platform to highlight the actions of repressive regimes.
",
16318,1,," both themoscow olympics and thegames in los angeles suffered boycotts from a range of countries protesting against the policies of the host nation.
",
16319,1,," 1993, china bid for theolympics, and its failure to win enough ioc votes then was widely linked the international concern over its use of military force to put down student protests in tiananmen square in 1989.
",
16320,1,," finally, beijing was awarded thesummer olympic games in 2001.
",
16321,1,," the decision delighted the chinese government and people, who saw it as international recognition of their country’s growing economic, sporting and political strength.
",
16322,1,," others criticised the choice of beijing as rewarding a dictatorial government with a terrible human rights record and a history of international trouble-making.
",
16323,0,,"  proponents, including the olympic committee, maintain however that sports events are not the time or place to raise such issues and that they should remain about the athletes, not politics.
",
16324,0,,"hosting the olympics , or any other global sports event , is a huge prize for any nation , giving them huge international prestige and attention , and repressive regimes do not deserve to be by being given the chance to host the games .
",
16325,0,," as the most recent repressive regime to host the games china is a good example .
",
16326,0,," china is a communist dictatorship which maintains tight political control over its 1.3 billion people .
",
16327,0,," all power is focused in the hands of the chinese communist party , and those who call for the introduction of democratic elections are arrested and jailed .
",
16328,0,," as the-then senator obama argued , ` it is past time for china to respect the human rights of the tibetan people ' , miller  .
",
16329,0,," instead china used the games as a coming out party to show the power of the state .
",
16330,0,," with the exception of the ussr in, every post-war olympics has been hosted by a democratic country and this has helped to promote democracy as a desirable norm for successful states .
",
16331,0,," many democratic countries refused to send teams to the moscow olympics and while countries did not feel they could do the same with china inthe principle remains the same -- we should not lend our support to legitimize dictatorships through sport .
",
16332,0,," when countries do not rise to the occasion offered by sports events and clean up their act they deserve to be boycotted .
",
16333,0,," in the case of thegames china has a terrible human rights record so in order to win the games in, china promised the ioc that it would improve its human rights record , but these promises were not kept .
",
16334,0,," thousands of political prisoners continued to suffer in chinese jails and labour camps with a quarter of a million people imprisoned without trial .
",
16335,0,," journalists are among those detained in this way , and the regime runs a huge censorship operation covering all forms of media including the internet despite promises of unprecedented openness to the media in the run up to and during the games .
",
16336,0,," once a state has been awarded the games there is little the awarding body can do to encourage the state to keep to its promises .
",
16337,0,," when a state does not improve we can not show our approval by sending a team to the olympics like the free world did in, missing the opportunity to ` use the limelight of the games to make an issue of germany 's deepening persecution of jews ' , tkacik jr.
",
16338,0,,"  .
",
16339,0,," the olympics are a celebration of international cooperation and peace .
",
16340,0,," this means that they should not go to states that do n't live up to this .
",
16341,0,," china is not a responsible actor on the global stage .
",
16342,0,," many groups like the heritage foundation ` cautiously welcomed ' the granting of the games to china as an opportunity ` to compel beijing to adopt true olympic values ' but they have been left disappointed , tkacik jr.
",
16343,0,,"  .
",
16344,0,," its support props up dictatorial regimes in sudan , zimbabwe , myanmar and north korea , offering them loans , aid investment and military support , all of which democratic countries have decided to withhold in protest against their repressive treatment of their own people .
",
16345,0,," china has also used its veto on the united nations security council to prevent concerted international sanctions being applied against these rogue states .
",
16346,0,," deciding to boycott the olympics when it is being hosted by regimes that do not uphold the values of the games , and would apply pressure both on the host and others to act more responsibly in future .
",
16347,0,," the sports bodies that pick athletes for the world 's major sports events can be dictated to by their respective governments .
",
16348,0,," as the sports bodies would ultimately be representing their state , not their sporting body , they need the approval of the government in question before they can compete .
",
16349,0,," furthermore , as much of the funding both the sport and their participation in the event is provided by the state , they must heed to the state 's decision .
",
16350,0,," if the government in question rules that the regime hosting the event is not deserving of the attention and credence bestowed on successful hosts , it has the ability to order its sports bodies and athletes to not travel .
",
16351,1,,"bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of spain, portugal, southern france and some latin american countries (mexico, colombia, venezuela, peru and ecuador), in which one or more bulls are baited and usually killed by a matador in a bullring for sport and entertainment.
",
16352,1,," it is often called a blood sport by its detractors but followers of the spectacle regard it as a fine art and not a sport as there are no elements of competition in the proceedings.
",
16353,1,," bullfighting is banned in most countries, and has been banned more recently in some countries and regions with long histories and traditions with the event.
",
16354,1,," most notably, bullfighting was banned inin the spanish region of catalonia and its largest city barcelona, where it has a centuries long history and attracted international fame.
",
16355,1,," at the same time, places like madrid have responded to such actions by officially preserving bullfighting as an art form.
",
16356,1,," this means that anti-bullfighting activists can be charged with a crime and a substantial fine for disrupting the patrimony of bullfighting and spanish culture.
",
16357,0,," these historic actions have re-enlivened the debate about bullfighting in spain and around the world.
",
16358,0,,"bullfighting constitutes animal torture because it is exactly the suffering of the animal from which the entertainment of the crowd is drawn , and the level of suffering inflicted is on the level of that caused by torture .
",
16359,0,," jeremy bentham argued that `` cock-fights and bull-fights , the chase of the hare and the fox , fishing , and other amusements of the same kind , necessarily suppose a want of reflection or a want of humanity ; since these sports inflict upon sensitive beings the most lively sufferings , and the most lingering and painful death that can be imagined . ''
",
16360,0,,"  the want of humanity even in modern bullfighting is shown by the sadistic cruelties inflicted on the bulls : according to anti-bullfight veterinarian josé zaldívar , in the great majority of cases , the matador missed the vital spot that would cause the bull to die quickly .
",
16361,0,," `` these provoke internal bleeding .
",
16362,0,," it is a slow , agonising death -- as the high acidity of their blood proves . ''
",
16363,0,,"  at the end of the fight , the bull may not be yet dead while his body parts are cut-off to be kept as trophies .
",
16364,0,," spanish bull breeders receive eu agricultural subsidies , meaning that , in the eu , taxpayers ' money from all countries , not just those with legal bullfighting , goes to support this terrible industry .
",
16365,0,,"  also , in order to reduce the risk to the matador , sometimes the bull 's horns are shaved .
",
16366,0,," this can inflict some pain on the bull and can also make it more sensitive to other forms of pain during the fight .
",
16367,0,,"  moreover , bulls are not the only creatures to suffer in bullrings .
",
16368,0,," the tormented bull does not understand that it is the man on the horse 's back that is causing his pain , only that he is in agony .
",
16369,0,," he therefore sees the horse as his enemy as much as the man .
",
16370,0,," it 's not unusual for horses used in bullfights to be so badly gored by the bulls that they have to be killed , but only after they have been dragged from the ring and the view of the spectators .
",
16371,0,,"  all this suffering makes bullfighting as unacceptable as the many other kinds of animal cruelty which most countries ban , such as cockfighting , dogfighting or any other form of grievous harm inflicted on an animal for ` entertainment ' purposes .
",
16372,0,,"  we have these laws because governments have generally acknowledged the truth of bentham 's words : `` it does n't matter if they can reason ; it does n't matter if they can speak ; what does matter is if they can suffer . ''
",
16373,0,,"  all nations need to follow through on this principle by making bullfighting illegal , just like any other form of animal torture .
",
16374,0,," if a creature suffers then there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration .
",
16375,0,," all animals are sentient beings that experience joy , happiness , fear and pain , in the same way that human beings do .
",
16376,0,," as bentham previously noted , it does not matter that they can not express this suffering in the same way as humans can , by speaking about it , or reason about their suffering in the same way - the important thing is that they can suffer in the first place .
",
16377,0,," we can have no right whatsoever to make them suffer for our ` enjoyment ' .
",
16378,0,," if any torture inflicted to an animal deserves condemnation , bullfights are the worst kind of torture since they are performed solely in the name of entertainment .
",
16379,0,," we must end the animals ' torture and stop these shows of brutality and violence .
",
16380,0,," it is too small a step from the intentional infliction of pain on an animal to the torture and killing of human beings .
",
16381,0,,"  bullfights perpetuate the idea that injuring and killing an animal for amusement is acceptable , and that is not an idea which any state with any concern for animals , or for its human citizens , should wish to be prevalent .
",
16382,0,," part of the ` attraction ' of bullfighting for crowds is witnessing death .
",
16383,0,," advocates of the practice make this into an argument for the practice .
",
16384,0,," but , a desire to see death in front of one 's own eye 's amounts to bloodlust .
",
16385,0,," why should humans be accommodated in such a morbid pursuit ?
",
16386,0,," eric gallego , an animal rights protester , said in: `` bullfighting is a bloody entertainment .
",
16387,0,," we must stop this cruelty because we do n't want to be a barbaric society in europe . ''
",
16388,0,,"  this argument applies just as much to any other country in the world : why would we want to encourage people to enjoy pain and suffering , as we have laws which make causing pain and suffering illegal , both for humans and animals , in almost every other context ?
",
16389,0,," bullfighting is therefore immoral , and encourages cruel and immoral behaviour in other areas , and so it should be banned .
",
16390,0,," many matadors are gored each year .
",
16391,0,," in, famed matador julio aparicio was gored in the throat by a bull during the festival of saint isidro .
",
16392,0,," the bulls horn went through his neck and throat and up through his mouth .
",
16393,0,," such gruesome scenes , and the risks that matadors must take with their lives , have no place in a modern society .
",
16394,0,,"  the culture and audience pressure of bullfighting actually increase the danger for matadors .
",
16395,0,," the bullfighters perceived and praised as ` the best ' are the ones that come closest to the bull , letting its horns pass inches by the fighter 's side , etc, the greater the risk for the bullfighter , the greater the reward from the crowd .
",
16396,0,," the bullfighter is not trying to stay as far away as possible in order to make a riskless kill ; they are trying to demonstrate their courage and bravery in the face of potentially fatal risks .
",
16397,0,,"  in spain and most other countries with bullfighting , the horns of bulls are not shaved , but rather kept sharp , increasing the danger for the matador .
",
16398,0,,"  the state bans many other kinds of activities on the grounds that they are harmful to the participants : taking narcotics is illegal , driving without a seatbelt is illegal , and in many countries even legal guns are required to be fitted with safety devices to protect the user .
",
16399,0,," this is yet another instance where , if the state did not step in , individuals would enter into certain activities which would be harmful to them .
",
16400,0,," the need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community , which may lead many of them to take risks , and suffer injuries , they otherwise would not , for fear of losing ` face ' .
",
16401,0,," bullfighting is just too dangerous to humans to allow , and so the state should step in and ban bullfighting to protect all those involved .
",
16402,1,,"in our globalized world with an increasingly international media, beauty standards for both men and women are becoming more internationalized - or, perhaps, westernized.
",
16403,1,," this has included skin tone, with cultural values in many countries favouring lighter skin tones.
",
16404,1,,"one particular aspect of this has been creams aiming to whiten skin.
",
16405,1,," this is not an issue that affects women, the key target of much of the fashion and beauty industry, exclusively - some products are aimed at men.
",
16406,1,," this is not a phenomenon unique to africa and communities of african origins.
",
16407,1,," india is a large market for skin whitening creams, with a market worth just shy of half a billion us dollars inand growing at nearly 20% per year.
",
16408,1,," in hong kong, around a third of women have used such products.
",
16409,1,," the issue of people seeking to look “whiter” or caucasian is not limited to any area or simply skin whitening creams – there are also products and the possibility of surgery to mimic more european-looking eyelids available in east asia.
",
16410,1,,"west africa is a key market for these products, with over half of women in togo and nigeria claiming to use them.
",
16411,1,," while some contain chemicals aimed at modifying the skin’s transfer of melanin, others use harsh chemicals such as mercury, which can lead to medical conditions from eczema and infections to renal failure.
",
16412,1,,"a particular controversy has been generated by the launch of a new skin whitening product in early 2014, known as “whitenicious”, by nigerian-cameroonian singer dencia, and her comments relating to the product, including a spat with actress lupita nyong’o. nyong’o, who shot to fame outside her native kenya following her powerful performance in the popular and well received british-american film “12 years a slave”, has been critical of skin lightening creams and the conception of lighter skin tones in african mind-sets.
",
16413,1,," in 2006, the us food and drug administration proposed a ban on over-the-counter sales of skin whitening creams.
",
16414,1,," is this a solution for africa?
",
16415,0,," skin whitening creams often contain a wide variety of harmful ingredients -- in some cases , mercury .
",
16416,0,," these can cause various health problems ; mercury in particular causes renal , kidney , damage , major skin problems as well as mental health issues .
",
16417,0,," states , throughout the world , ban consumer products because they are harmful regardless of whether this is for consumption or for cosmetics .
",
16418,0,," this is just another case where that is appropriate in order to prevent the harm to health that may occur .
",
16419,0,," allowing the use of racial overtones -- the perception that a product will bring a person towards a `` white ideal '' is harmful for several reasons .
",
16420,0,," it could cause communities to generate a form of inferiority complex , and it reinforces the structural difference rather than aiming to minimize it .
",
16421,0,," while it may sound absurd , in the us darker-skinned african americans , and darker skinned latinos , are less well educated and have lower incomes .
",
16422,0,," elsewhere in the western hemisphere , such as in brazil , race is seen as an issue of colour and socio-economic background , not ancestry highlighting a much more obvious link between whitening creams and racism .
",
16423,0,," is it not the role of the state to reduce that discrimination , not to fuel it ?
",
16424,0,," banning such creams would help prevent such harmful effects by discouraging the notion that people should aim to make themselves lighter skinned .
",
16425,0,," skin whitening can be seen as an attempt to fit in with a form of a neo-colonialist mind-set ; a form of cultural imperialism driven by capitalism .
",
16426,0,," these products , often sold by big international fmcg , fast moving consumer goods , companies feed off a neo-colonialist mind-set -- one of a cultural inferiority complex .
",
16427,0,," these products form part of the process of tying african people into a globalised consumer world where non-westerners feel compelled to buy western products that they do n't need .
",
16428,0,," they are therefore kept in a colonial situation where they are dependent on the west both mentally and in terms of the products they buy .
",
16429,0,," that is reason enough for nations that have been victims of colonialism by the global north to take action against them .
